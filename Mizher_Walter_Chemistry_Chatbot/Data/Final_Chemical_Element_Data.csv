Element,Symbol,Data,Atomic Number
Hydrogen,H,hydrogen is the chemical element with the symbol h and atomic number hydrogen is the lightest element at standard conditions hydrogen is a gas of diatomic molecules having the formula h it is colorless odorless tasteless non toxic and highly combustible hydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe constituting roughly of all normal matter stars such as the sun are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state most of the hydrogen on earth exists in molecular forms such as water and organic compounds for the most common isotope of hydrogen symbol h each atom has one proton one electron and no neutrons in the early universe the formation of protons the nuclei of hydrogen occurred during the first second after the big bang the emergence of neutral hydrogen atoms throughout the universe occurred about years later during the recombination epoch when the plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons hydrogen is nonmetallic except at extremely high pressures and readily forms a single covalent bond with most nonmetallic elements forming compounds such as water and nearly all organic compounds hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid base reactions because these reactions usually involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules in ionic compounds hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge i e anion where it is known as a hydride or as a positively charged i e cation species denoted by the symbol h the h cation is simply a proton symbol p but its behavior in aqueous solutions and in ionic compounds involves screening of its electric charge by nearby polar molecules or anions because hydrogen is the only neutral atom for which the schr dinger equation can be solved analytically the study of its energetics and chemical bonding has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early th century by the reaction of acids on metals in henry cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance and that it produces water when burned the property for which it was later named in greek hydrogen means water former industrial production is mainly from steam reforming of natural gas oil reforming or coal gasification a small percentage is also produced using more energy intensive methods such as the electrolysis of water most hydrogen is used near the site of its production the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing e g hydrocracking and ammonia production mostly for the fertilizer market it can be burned to produce heat or combined with oxygen in fuel cells to generate electricity directly with water being the only emissions at the point of usage hydrogen atoms but not gaseous molecules are problematic in metallurgy because they can embrittle many metals properties combustion hydrogen gas dihydrogen or molecular hydrogen is highly flammable h g o g h o l kj mol kj mol mj kg the enthalpy of combustion is kj mol hydrogen gas forms explosive mixtures with air in concentrations from and with chlorine at the explosive reactions may be triggered by spark heat or sunlight the hydrogen autoignition temperature the temperature of spontaneous ignition in air is c f flame pure hydrogen oxygen flames emit ultraviolet light and with high oxygen mix are nearly invisible to the naked eye as illustrated by the faint plume of the space shuttle main engine compared to the highly visible plume of a space shuttle solid rocket booster which uses an ammonium perchlorate composite the detection of a burning hydrogen leak may require a flame detector such leaks can be very dangerous hydrogen flames in other conditions are blue resembling blue natural gas flames the destruction of the hindenburg airship was a notorious example of hydrogen combustion and the cause is still debated the visible flames in the photographs were the result of carbon compounds in the airship skin burning reactants h is unreactive compared to diatomic elements such as halogens or oxygen the thermodynamic basis of this low reactivity is the very strong h h bond with a bond dissociation energy of kj mol the kinetic basis of the low reactivity is the nonpolar nature of h and its weak polarizability it spontaneously reacts with chlorine and fluorine to form hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride respectively the reactivity of h is strongly affected by the presence of metal catalysts thus while mixtures of h with o or air combust readily when heated to at least c by a spark or flame they do not react at room temperature in the absence of a catalyst electron energy levels the ground state energy level of the electron in a hydrogen atom is ev which is equivalent to an ultraviolet photon of roughly nm wavelength the energy levels of hydrogen can be calculated fairly accurately using the bohr model of the atom which conceptualizes the electron as orbiting the proton in analogy to the earth s orbit of the sun however the atomic electron and proton are held together by electromagnetic force while planets and celestial objects are held by gravity because of the discretization of angular momentum postulated in early quantum mechanics by bohr the electron in the bohr model can only occupy certain allowed distances from the proton and therefore only certain allowed energies a more accurate description of the hydrogen atom comes from a purely quantum mechanical treatment that uses the schr dinger equation dirac equation or feynman path integral formulation to calculate the probability density of the electron around the proton the most complicated treatments allow for the small effects of special relativity and vacuum polarization in the quantum mechanical treatment the electron in a ground state hydrogen atom has no angular momentum at all illustrating how the planetary orbit differs from electron motion spin isomers molecular h exists as two spin isomers i e compounds that differ only in the spin states of their nuclei in the orthohydrogen form the spins of the two nuclei are parallel forming a spin triplet state having a total molecular spin s displaystyle s in the parahydrogen form the spins are antiparallel and form a spin singlet state having spin s displaystyle s the equilibrium ratio of ortho to para hydrogen depends on temperature at room temperature or warmer equilibrium hydrogen gas contains about of the para form and of the ortho form the ortho form is an excited state having higher energy than the para form by kj mol and it converts to the para form over the course of several minutes when cooled to low temperature the thermal properties of the forms differ because they differ in their allowed rotational quantum states resulting in different thermal properties such as the heat capacity the ortho to para ratio in h is an important consideration in the liquefaction and storage of liquid hydrogen the conversion from ortho to para is exothermic and produces enough heat to evaporate a most of the liquid if not converted first to parahydrogen during the cooling process catalysts for the ortho para interconversion such as ferric oxide and activated carbon compounds are used during hydrogen cooling to avoid this loss of liquid phases gaseous hydrogen liquid hydrogen slush hydrogen solid hydrogen metallic hydrogen plasma hydrogen compounds covalent and organic compounds while h is not very reactive under standard conditions it does form compounds with most elements hydrogen can form compounds with elements that are more electronegative such as halogens f cl br i or oxygen in these compounds hydrogen takes on a partial positive charge when bonded to a more electronegative element particularly fluorine oxygen or nitrogen hydrogen can participate in a form of medium strength noncovalent bonding with another electronegative element with a lone pair a phenomenon called hydrogen bonding that is critical to the stability of many biological molecules hydrogen also forms compounds with less electronegative elements such as metals and metalloids where it takes on a partial negative charge these compounds are often known as hydrides hydrogen forms a vast array of compounds with carbon called the hydrocarbons and an even vaster array with heteroatoms that because of their general association with living things are called organic compounds the study of their properties is known as organic chemistry and their study in the context of living organisms is known as biochemistry by some definitions organic compounds are only required to contain carbon however most of them also contain hydrogen and because it is the carbon hydrogen bond that gives this class of compounds most of its particular chemical characteristics carbon hydrogen bonds are required in some definitions of the word organic in chemistry millions of hydrocarbons are known and they are usually formed by complicated pathways that seldom involve elemental hydrogen hydrogen is highly soluble in many rare earth and transition metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice these properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks but the gas s high solubility is a metallurgical problem contributing to the embrittlement of many metals complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks hydrides compounds of hydrogen are often called hydrides a term that is used fairly loosely the term hydride suggests that the h atom has acquired a negative or anionic character denoted h and is used when hydrogen forms a compound with a more electropositive element the existence of the hydride anion suggested by gilbert n lewis in for group and salt like hydrides was demonstrated by moers in by the electrolysis of molten lithium hydride lih producing a stoichiometric quantity of hydrogen at the anode for hydrides other than group and metals the term is quite misleading considering the low electronegativity of hydrogen an exception in group hydrides is beh which is polymeric in lithium aluminium hydride the alh anion carries hydridic centers firmly attached to the al iii although hydrides can be formed with almost all main group elements the number and combination of possible compounds varies widely for example more than binary borane hydrides are known but only one binary aluminium hydride binary indium hydride has not yet been identified although larger complexes exist in inorganic chemistry hydrides can also serve as bridging ligands that link two metal centers in a coordination complex this function is particularly common in group elements especially in boranes boron hydrides and aluminium complexes as well as in clustered carboranes protons and acids oxidation of hydrogen removes its electron and gives h which contains no electrons and a nucleus which is usually composed of one proton that is why h is often called a proton this species is central to discussion of acids under the br nsted lowry acid base theory acids are proton donors while bases are proton acceptors a bare proton h cannot exist in solution or in ionic crystals because of its unstoppable attraction to other atoms or molecules with electrons except at the high temperatures associated with plasmas such protons cannot be removed from the electron clouds of atoms and molecules and will remain attached to them however the term proton is sometimes used loosely and metaphorically to refer to positively charged or cationic hydrogen attached to other species in this fashion and as such is denoted h without any implication that any single protons exist freely as a species to avoid the implication of the naked solvated proton in solution acidic aqueous solutions are sometimes considered to contain a less unlikely fictitious species termed the hydronium ion h o however even in this case such solvated hydrogen cations are more realistically conceived as being organized into clusters that form species closer to h o other oxonium ions are found when water is in acidic solution with other solvents although exotic on earth one of the most common ions in the universe is the h ion known as protonated molecular hydrogen or the trihydrogen cation isotopes hydrogen has three naturally occurring isotopes denoted h h and h other highly unstable nuclei h to h have been synthesized in the laboratory but not observed in nature h is the most common hydrogen isotope with an abundance of more than because the nucleus of this isotope consists of only a single proton it is given the descriptive but rarely used formal name protium it is unique among all stable isotopes in having no neutrons see diproton for a discussion of why others do not exist h the other stable hydrogen isotope is known as deuterium and contains one proton and one neutron in the nucleus all deuterium in the universe is thought to have been produced at the time of the big bang and has endured since that time deuterium is not radioactive and does not represent a significant toxicity hazard water enriched in molecules that include deuterium instead of normal hydrogen is called heavy water deuterium and its compounds are used as a non radioactive label in chemical experiments and in solvents for h nmr spectroscopy heavy water is used as a neutron moderator and coolant for nuclear reactors deuterium is also a potential fuel for commercial nuclear fusion h is known as tritium and contains one proton and two neutrons in its nucleus it is radioactive decaying into helium through beta decay with a half life of years it is so radioactive that it can be used in luminous paint making it useful in such things as watches the glass prevents the small amount of radiation from getting out small amounts of tritium are produced naturally by the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric gases tritium has also been released during nuclear weapons tests it is used in nuclear fusion reactions as a tracer in isotope geochemistry and in specialized self powered lighting devices tritium has also been used in chemical and biological labeling experiments as a radiolabel unique among the elements distinct names are assigned to its isotopes in common use today during the early study of radioactivity various heavy radioactive isotopes were given their own names but such names are no longer used except for deuterium and tritium the symbols d and t instead of h and h are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium but the symbol p is already in use for phosphorus and thus is not available for protium in its nomenclatural guidelines the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac allows any of d t h and h to be used although h and h are preferred the exotic atom muonium symbol mu composed of an antimuon and an electron can also be considered a light radioisotope of hydrogen because muons decay with lifetime s muonium is too unstable to exhibit observable chemistry nevertheless muonium compounds are important test cases for quantum simulation due to the mass difference between the antimuon and the proton and iupac nomenclature incorporates such hypothetical compounds as muonium chloride mucl and sodium muonide namu analogous to hydrogen chloride and sodium hydride respectively thermal and physical properties table of thermal and physical properties of hydrogen h at atmospheric pressure history discovery and use in robert boyle discovered and described the reaction between iron filings and dilute acids which results in the production of hydrogen gas in henry cavendish was the first to recognize hydrogen gas as a discrete substance by naming the gas from a metal acid reaction inflammable air he speculated that inflammable air was in fact identical to the hypothetical substance called phlogiston and further finding in that the gas produces water when burned he is usually given credit for the discovery of hydrogen as an element in antoine lavoisier gave the element the name hydrogen from the greek hydro meaning water and genes meaning former when he and laplace reproduced cavendish s finding that water is produced when hydrogen is burned lavoisier produced hydrogen for his experiments on mass conservation by reacting a flux of steam with metallic iron through an incandescent iron tube heated in a fire anaerobic oxidation of iron by the protons of water at high temperature can be schematically represented by the set of following reactions fe h o feo h fe h o fe o h fe h o fe o h many metals such as zirconium undergo a similar reaction with water leading to the production of hydrogen hydrogen was liquefied for the first time by james dewar in by using regenerative cooling and his invention the vacuum flask he produced solid hydrogen the next year deuterium was discovered in december by harold urey and tritium was prepared in by ernest rutherford mark oliphant and paul harteck heavy water which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen was discovered by urey s group in fran ois isaac de rivaz built the first de rivaz engine an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in edward daniel clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in the d bereiner s lamp and limelight were invented in the first hydrogen filled balloon was invented by jacques charles in hydrogen provided the lift for the first reliable form of air travel following the invention of the first hydrogen lifted airship by henri giffard german count ferdinand von zeppelin promoted the idea of rigid airships lifted by hydrogen that later were called zeppelins the first of which had its maiden flight in regularly scheduled flights started in and by the outbreak of world war i in august they had carried passengers without a serious incident hydrogen lifted airships were used as observation platforms and bombers during the war the first non stop transatlantic crossing was made by the british airship r in regular passenger service resumed in the s and the discovery of helium reserves in the united states promised increased safety but the u s government refused to sell the gas for this purpose therefore h was used in the hindenburg airship which was destroyed in a midair fire over new jersey on may the incident was broadcast live on radio and filmed ignition of leaking hydrogen is widely assumed to be the cause but later investigations pointed to the ignition of the aluminized fabric coating by static electricity but the damage to hydrogen s reputation as a lifting gas was already done and commercial hydrogen airship travel ceased hydrogen is still used in preference to non flammable but more expensive helium as a lifting gas for weather balloons in the same year the first hydrogen cooled turbogenerator went into service with gaseous hydrogen as a coolant in the rotor and the stator in at dayton ohio by the dayton power light co because of the thermal conductivity and very low viscosity of hydrogen gas thus lower drag than air this is the most common type in its field today for large generators typically mw and bigger smaller generators are usually air cooled the nickel hydrogen battery was used for the first time in aboard the u s navy s navigation technology satellite nts for example the iss mars odyssey and the mars global surveyor are equipped with nickel hydrogen batteries in the dark part of its orbit the hubble space telescope is also powered by nickel hydrogen batteries which were finally replaced in may more than years after launch and years beyond their design life role in quantum theory because of its simple atomic structure consisting only of a proton and an electron the hydrogen atom together with the spectrum of light produced from it or absorbed by it has been central to the development of the theory of atomic structure furthermore study of the corresponding simplicity of the hydrogen molecule and the corresponding cation h brought understanding of the nature of the chemical bond which followed shortly after the quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom had been developed in the mid s one of the first quantum effects to be explicitly noticed but not understood at the time was a maxwell observation involving hydrogen half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived maxwell observed that the specific heat capacity of h unaccountably departs from that of a diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures according to quantum theory this behavior arises from the spacing of the quantized rotational energy levels which are particularly wide spaced in h because of its low mass these widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect antihydrogen h is the antimatter counterpart to hydrogen it consists of an antiproton with a positron antihydrogen is the only type of antimatter atom to have been produced as of cosmic prevalence and distribution hydrogen as atomic h is the most abundant chemical element in the universe making up percent of normal matter by mass and more than percent by number of atoms most of the mass of the universe however is not in the form of chemical element type matter but rather is postulated to occur as yet undetected forms of mass such as dark matter and dark energy this element is found in great abundance in stars and gas giant planets molecular clouds of h are associated with star formation hydrogen plays a vital role in powering stars through the proton proton reaction in case of stars with very low to approximately mass of the sun and the cno cycle of nuclear fusion in case of stars more massive than our sun states throughout the universe hydrogen is mostly found in the atomic and plasma states with properties quite distinct from those of molecular hydrogen as a plasma hydrogen s electron and proton are not bound together resulting in very high electrical conductivity and high emissivity producing the light from the sun and other stars the charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields for example in the solar wind they interact with the earth s magnetosphere giving rise to birkeland currents and the aurora hydrogen is found in the neutral atomic state in the interstellar medium because the atoms seldom collide and combine they are the source of the cm hydrogen line at mhz that is detected in order to probe primordial hydrogen the large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the damped lyman alpha systems is thought to dominate the cosmological baryonic density of the universe up to a redshift of z under ordinary conditions on earth elemental hydrogen exists as the diatomic gas h hydrogen gas is very rare in the earth s atmosphere ppm by volume because of its light weight which enables it to escape from the atmosphere more rapidly than heavier gases however hydrogen is the third most abundant element on the earth s surface mostly in the form of chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and water a molecular form called protonated molecular hydrogen h is found in the interstellar medium where it is generated by ionization of molecular hydrogen from cosmic rays this ion has also been observed in the upper atmosphere of the planet jupiter the ion is relatively stable in the environment of outer space due to the low temperature and density h is one of the most abundant ions in the universe and it plays a notable role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium neutral triatomic hydrogen h can exist only in an excited form and is unstable by contrast the positive hydrogen molecular ion h is a rare molecule in the universe production h is produced in chemistry and biology laboratories often as a by product of other reactions in industry for the hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates and in nature as a means of expelling reducing equivalents in biochemical reactions water electrolysis the electrolysis of water is a simple method of producing hydrogen a current is run through the water and gaseous oxygen forms at the anode while gaseous hydrogen forms at the cathode typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage if however the gas is to be burnt on site oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals iron for instance would oxidize and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off the theoretical maximum efficiency electricity used vs energetic value of hydrogen produced is in the range h o l h g o g methane pyrolysis hydrogen production using natural gas methane pyrolysis is a one step process that produces no greenhouse gases developing volume production using this method is the key to enabling faster carbon reduction by using hydrogen in industrial processes fuel cell electric heavy truck transportation and in gas turbine electric power generation methane pyrolysis is performed by having methane ch bubbled up through a molten metal catalyst containing dissolved nickel at k c f this causes the methane to break down into hydrogen gas and solid carbon with no other byproducts ch g c s h g h kj mol the industrial quality solid carbon may be sold as manufacturing feedstock or permanently landfilled it is not released into the atmosphere and does not cause ground water pollution in landfill methane pyrolysis is in development and considered suitable for commercial bulk hydrogen production volume production is being evaluated in the basf methane pyrolysis at scale pilot plant further research continues in several laboratories including at karlsruhe liquid metal laboratory kalla and the chemical engineering laboratory at university of california santa barbara other industrial methods hydrogen is often produced by reacting water with methane and carbon monoxide which causes the removal of hydrogen from hydrocarbons at very high temperatures with of hydrogen production coming from steam reforming the water vapor is then reacted with the carbon monoxide produced by steam reforming to oxidize it to carbon dioxide and turn the water into hydrogen commercial bulk hydrogen is usually produced by the steam reforming of natural gas with release of atmospheric greenhouse gas or with capture using ccs and climate change mitigation steam reforming is also known as the bosch process and is widely used for the industrial preparation of hydrogen at high temperatures k c or f steam water vapor reacts with methane to yield carbon monoxide and h ch h o co h this reaction is favored at low pressures but is nonetheless conducted at high pressures mpa atm or inhg this is because high pressure h is the most marketable product and pressure swing adsorption psa purification systems work better at higher pressures the product mixture is known as synthesis gas because it is often used directly for the production of methanol and related compounds hydrocarbons other than methane can be used to produce synthesis gas with varying product ratios one of the many complications to this highly optimized technology is the formation of coke or carbon ch c h consequently steam reforming typically employs an excess of h o additional hydrogen can be recovered from the steam by use of carbon monoxide through the water gas shift reaction especially with an iron oxide catalyst this reaction is also a common industrial source of carbon dioxide co h o co h other important methods for co and h production include partial oxidation of hydrocarbons ch o co h and the coal reaction which can serve as a prelude to the shift reaction above c h o co h hydrogen is sometimes produced and consumed in the same industrial process without being separated in the haber process for the production of ammonia hydrogen is generated from natural gas electrolysis of brine to yield chlorine also produces hydrogen as a co product olefin production units may produce substantial quantities of byproduct hydrogen particularly from cracking light feedstocks like ethane or propane metal acid many metals react with water to produce h but the rate of hydrogen evolution depends on the metal the ph and the presence alloying agents most commonly hydrogen evolution is induced by acids the alkali and alkaline earth metals aluminium zinc manganese and iron react readily with aqueous acids this reaction is the basis of the kipp s apparatus which once was used as a laboratory gas source zn h zn h in the absence of acid the evolution of h is slower because iron is widely used structural material its anaerobic corrosion is of technological significance fe h o fe oh h many metals such as aluminium are slow to react with water because they form passivated coatings of oxides an alloy of aluminium and gallium however does react with water at high ph aluminium can produce h al h o oh al oh h some metal containing compounds react with acids to evolve h under anaerobic conditions ferrous hydroxide fe oh can be oxidized by the protons of water to form magnetite and h this process is described by the schikorr reaction fe oh fe o h o h this process occurs during the anaerobic corrosion of iron and steel in oxygen free groundwater and in reducing soils below the water table thermochemical more than thermochemical cycles can be used for water splitting many of these cycles such as the iron oxide cycle cerium iv oxide cerium iii oxide cycle zinc zinc oxide cycle sulfur iodine cycle copper chlorine cycle and hybrid sulfur cycle have been evaluated for their commercial potential to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water and heat without using electricity a number of laboratories including in france germany greece japan and the united states are developing thermochemical methods to produce hydrogen from solar energy and water serpentinization reaction in deep geological conditions prevailing far away from the earth s atmosphere hydrogen h is produced during the process of serpentinization in this process water protons h are reduced by ferrous fe ions provided by fayalite fe sio the reaction forms magnetite fe o quartz sio and hydrogen h fe sio h o fe o sio h fayalite water magnetite quartz hydrogenthis reaction closely resembles the schikorr reaction observed in anaerobic oxidation of ferrous hydroxide in contact with water applications petrochemical industry large quantities of h are used in the upgrading of fossil fuels key consumers of h include hydrodealkylation hydrodesulfurization and hydrocracking many of these reactions can be classified as hydrogenolysis i e the cleavage of bonds to carbon illustrative is the separation of sulfur from liquid fossil fuels r s h h s rh hydrogenation hydrogenation the addition of h to various substrates is conducted on a large scale the hydrogenation of n to produce ammonia by the haber bosch process consumes a few percent of the energy budget in the entire industry the resulting ammonia is used to supply the majority of the protein consumed by humans hydrogenation is used to convert unsaturated fats and oils to saturated fats and oils the major application is the production of margarine methanol is produced by hydrogenation of carbon dioxide it is similarly the source of hydrogen in the manufacture of hydrochloric acid h is also used as a reducing agent for the conversion of some ores to the metals coolant hydrogen is commonly used in power stations as a coolant in generators due to a number of favorable properties that are a direct result of its light diatomic molecules these include low density low viscosity and the highest specific heat and thermal conductivity of all gases energy carrier elemental hydrogen has been widely discussed in the context of energy as a possible future carrier of energy on an economy wide scale hydrogen is a carrier of energy rather than an energy resource because there is no naturally occurring source of hydrogen in useful quantities hydrogen can be burned to produce heat or combined with oxygen in fuel cells to generate electricity directly with water being the only emissions at the point of usage the overall lifecycle emissions of hydrogen depend on how it is produced nearly all of the world s current supply of hydrogen is created from fossil fuels the main method is steam methane reforming in which hydrogen is produced from a chemical reaction between steam and methane the main component of natural gas producing one tonne of hydrogen through this process emits tonnes of carbon dioxide while carbon capture and storage can remove a large fraction of these emissions the overall carbon footprint of hydrogen from natural gas is difficult to assess as of in part because of emissions created in the production of the natural gas itself electricity can be used to split water molecules producing sustainable hydrogen provided the electricity was generated sustainably however this electrolysis process is currently more expensive than creating hydrogen from methane and the efficiency of energy conversion is inherently low hydrogen can be produced when there is a surplus of variable renewable electricity then stored and used to generate heat or to re generate electricity it can be further transformed into synthetic fuels such as ammonia and methanol innovation in hydrogen electrolysers could make large scale production of hydrogen from electricity more cost competitive there is potential for hydrogen to play a significant role in decarbonising energy systems because in certain sectors replacing fossil fuels with direct use of electricity would be very difficult hydrogen fuel can produce the intense heat required for industrial production of steel cement glass and chemicals for steelmaking hydrogen can function as a clean energy carrier and simultaneously as a low carbon catalyst replacing coal derived coke hydrogen used in transportation would burn relatively cleanly with some nox emissions but without carbon emissions disadvantages of hydrogen as an energy carrier include high costs of storage and distribution due to hydrogen s explosivity its large volume compared to other fuels and its tendency to make pipes brittle the infrastructure costs associated with full conversion to a hydrogen economy would be substantial semiconductor industry hydrogen is employed to saturate broken dangling bonds of amorphous silicon and amorphous carbon that helps stabilizing material properties it is also a potential electron donor in various oxide materials including zno sno cdo mgo zro hfo la o y o tio srtio laalo sio al o zrsio hfsio and srzro aerospace liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen together serve as cryogenic fuel in liquid propellant rockets as in the space shuttle main engines niche and evolving uses shielding gas hydrogen is used as a shielding gas in welding methods such as atomic hydrogen welding cryogenic research liquid h is used in cryogenic research including superconductivity studies buoyant lifting because h is lighter than air having only of the density of air it was once widely used as a lifting gas in balloons and airships leak detection pure or mixed with nitrogen sometimes called forming gas hydrogen is a tracer gas for detection of minute leaks applications can be found in the automotive chemical power generation aerospace and telecommunications industries hydrogen is an authorized food additive e that allows food package leak testing as well as having anti oxidizing properties neutron moderation deuterium hydrogen is used in nuclear fission applications as a moderator to slow neutrons nuclear fusion fuel deuterium is used in nuclear fusion reactions isotopic labeling deuterium compounds have applications in chemistry and biology in studies of isotope effects on reaction rates rocket propellant nasa has investigated the use of rocket propellant made from atomic hydrogen boron or carbon that is frozen into solid molecular hydrogen particles that are suspended in liquid helium upon warming the mixture vaporizes to allow the atomic species to recombine heating the mixture to high temperature tritium uses tritium hydrogen produced in nuclear reactors is used in the production of hydrogen bombs as an isotopic label in the biosciences and as a source of beta radiation in radioluminescent paint for instrument dials and emergency signage biological reactions h is a product of some types of anaerobic metabolism and is produced by several microorganisms usually via reactions catalyzed by iron or nickel containing enzymes called hydrogenases these enzymes catalyze the reversible redox reaction between h and its component two protons and two electrons creation of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer of reducing equivalents produced during pyruvate fermentation to water the natural cycle of hydrogen production and consumption by organisms is called the hydrogen cycle hydrogen is the most abundant element in the human body in terms of numbers of atoms of the element but it is the rd most abundant element by mass because hydrogen is so light h occurs in the breath of humans due to the metabolic activity of hydrogenase containing microorganisms in the large intestine the concentration in fasted people at rest is typically less than parts per million ppm but can be ppm when people with intestinal disorders consume molecules they cannot absorb during diagnostic hydrogen breath tests hydrogen gas is produced by some bacteria and algae and is a natural component of flatus as is methane itself a hydrogen source of increasing importance water splitting in which water is decomposed into its component protons electrons and oxygen occurs in the light reactions in all photosynthetic organisms some such organisms including the alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii and cyanobacteria have evolved a second step in the dark reactions in which protons and electrons are reduced to form h gas by specialized hydrogenases in the chloroplast efforts have been undertaken to genetically modify cyanobacterial hydrogenases to efficiently synthesize h gas even in the presence of oxygen efforts have also been undertaken with genetically modified alga in a bioreactor safety and precautions hydrogen poses a number of hazards to human safety from potential detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure oxygen free form in addition liquid hydrogen is a cryogen and presents dangers such as frostbite associated with very cold liquids hydrogen dissolves in many metals and in addition to leaking out may have adverse effects on them such as hydrogen embrittlement leading to cracks and explosions hydrogen gas leaking into external air may spontaneously ignite moreover hydrogen fire while being extremely hot is almost invisible and thus can lead to accidental burns even interpreting the hydrogen data including safety data is confounded by a number of phenomena many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the parahydrogen orthohydrogen ratio it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio for which the data is usually given hydrogen detonation parameters such as critical detonation pressure and temperature strongly depend on the container geometry ,1
Helium,He,helium from greek romanized helios lit sun is a chemical element with the symbol he and atomic number it is a colorless odorless tasteless non toxic inert monatomic gas and the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table its boiling and melting point are the lowest among all the elements it is the second lightest and second most abundant element in the observable universe hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant it is present at about of the total elemental mass which is more than times the mass of all the heavier elements combined its abundance is similar to this in both the sun and in jupiter due to the very high nuclear binding energy per nucleon of helium with respect to the next three elements after helium this helium binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay most helium in the universe is helium the vast majority of which was formed during the big bang large amounts of new helium are created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars helium was first detected as an unknown yellow spectral line signature in sunlight during a solar eclipse in by georges rayet captain c t haig norman r pogson and lieutenant john herschel and was subsequently confirmed by french astronomer jules janssen janssen is often jointly credited with detecting the element along with norman lockyer janssen recorded the helium spectral line during the solar eclipse of while lockyer observed it from britain lockyer was the first to propose that the line was due to a new element which he named the formal discovery of the element was made in by chemists sir william ramsay per teodor cleve and nils abraham langlet who found helium emanating from the uranium ore cleveite which is now not regarded as a separate mineral species but as a variety of uraninite in large reserves of helium were found in natural gas fields in parts of the united states by far the largest supplier of the gas today liquid helium is used in cryogenics its largest single use absorbing about a quarter of production and in the cooling of superconducting magnets with its main commercial application in mri scanners helium s other industrial uses as a pressurizing and purge gas as a protective atmosphere for arc welding and in processes such as growing crystals to make silicon wafers account for half of the gas produced a well known but minor use is as a lifting gas in balloons and airships as with any gas whose density differs from that of air inhaling a small volume of helium temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice in scientific research the behavior of the two fluid phases of helium helium i and helium ii is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics in particular the property of superfluidity and to those looking at the phenomena such as superconductivity produced in matter near absolute zero on earth it is relatively rare ppm by volume in the atmosphere most terrestrial helium present today is created by the natural radioactive decay of heavy radioactive elements thorium and uranium although there are other examples as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist of helium nuclei this radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations as great as by volume from which it is extracted commercially by a low temperature separation process called fractional distillation terrestrial helium is a non renewable resource because once released into the atmosphere it promptly escapes into space its supply is thought to be rapidly diminishing however some studies suggest that helium produced deep in the earth by radioactive decay can collect in natural gas reserves in larger than expected quantities in some cases having been released by volcanic activity history scientific discoveries the first evidence of helium was observed on august as a bright yellow line with a wavelength of nanometers in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the sun the line was detected by french astronomer jules janssen during a total solar eclipse in guntur india this line was initially assumed to be sodium on october of the same year english astronomer norman lockyer observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum which he named the d because it was near the known d and d fraunhofer line lines of sodium he concluded that it was caused by an element in the sun unknown on earth lockyer and english chemist edward frankland named the element with the greek word for the sun helios in italian physicist luigi palmieri detected helium on earth for the first time through its d spectral line when he analyzed a material that had been sublimated during a recent eruption of mount vesuvius on march scottish chemist sir william ramsay isolated helium on earth by treating the mineral cleveite a variety of uraninite with at least rare earth elements with mineral acids ramsay was looking for argon but after separating nitrogen and oxygen from the gas liberated by sulfuric acid he noticed a bright yellow line that matched the d line observed in the spectrum of the sun these samples were identified as helium by lockyer and british physicist william crookes it was independently isolated from cleveite in the same year by chemists per teodor cleve and abraham langlet in uppsala sweden who collected enough of the gas to accurately determine its atomic weight helium was also isolated by the american geochemist william francis hillebrand prior to ramsay s discovery when he noticed unusual spectral lines while testing a sample of the mineral uraninite hillebrand however attributed the lines to nitrogen his letter of congratulations to ramsay offers an interesting case of discovery and near discovery in science in ernest rutherford and thomas royds demonstrated that alpha particles are helium nuclei by allowing the particles to penetrate the thin glass wall of an evacuated tube then creating a discharge in the tube to study the spectrum of the new gas inside in helium was first liquefied by dutch physicist heike kamerlingh onnes by cooling the gas to less than k c f he tried to solidify it by further reducing the temperature but failed because helium does not solidify at atmospheric pressure onnes student willem hendrik keesom was eventually able to solidify cm of helium in by applying additional external pressure in niels bohr published his trilogy on atomic structure that included a reconsideration of the pickering fowler series as central evidence in support of his model of the atom this series is named for edward charles pickering who in published observations of previously unknown lines in the spectrum of the star puppis these are now known to occur with wolf rayet and other hot stars pickering attributed the observation lines at and to a new form of hydrogen with half integer transition levels in alfred fowler managed to produce similar lines from a hydrogen helium mixture and supported pickering s conclusion as to their origin bohr s model does not allow for half integer transitions nor does quantum mechanics and bohr concluded that pickering and fowler were wrong and instead assigned these spectral lines to ionised helium he fowler was initially skeptical but was ultimately convinced that bohr was correct and by spectroscopists had transferred the pickering fowler series definitively from hydrogen to helium bohr s theoretical work on the pickering series had demonstrated the need for a re examination of problems that seemed already to have been solved within classical theories and provided important confirmation for his atomic theory in russian physicist pyotr leonidovich kapitsa discovered that helium has almost no viscosity at temperatures near absolute zero a phenomenon now called superfluidity this phenomenon is related to bose einstein condensation in the same phenomenon was observed in helium but at temperatures much closer to absolute zero by american physicists douglas d osheroff david m lee and robert c richardson the phenomenon in helium is thought to be related to pairing of helium fermions to make bosons in analogy to cooper pairs of electrons producing superconductivity extraction and use after an oil drilling operation in in dexter kansas produced a gas geyser that would not burn kansas state geologist erasmus haworth collected samples of the escaping gas and took them back to the university of kansas at lawrence where with the help of chemists hamilton cady and david mcfarland he discovered that the gas consisted of by volume nitrogen methane a combustible percentage only with sufficient oxygen hydrogen and an unidentifiable gas with further analysis cady and mcfarland discovered that of the gas sample was helium this showed that despite its overall rarity on earth helium was concentrated in large quantities under the american great plains available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas this enabled the united states to become the world s leading supplier of helium following a suggestion by sir richard threlfall the united states navy sponsored three small experimental helium plants during world war i the goal was to supply barrage balloons with the non flammable lighter than air gas a total of m cu ft of helium was produced in the program even though less than a cubic meter of the gas had previously been obtained some of this gas was used in the world s first helium filled airship the u s navy s c class blimp c which flew its maiden voyage from hampton roads virginia to bolling field in washington d c on december nearly two years before the navy s first rigid helium filled airship the naval aircraft factory built uss shenandoah flew in september although the extraction process using low temperature gas liquefaction was not developed in time to be significant during world war i production continued helium was primarily used as a lifting gas in lighter than air craft during world war ii the demand increased for helium for lifting gas and for shielded arc welding the helium mass spectrometer was also vital in the atomic bomb manhattan project the government of the united states set up the national helium reserve in at amarillo texas with the goal of supplying military airships in time of war and commercial airships in peacetime because of the helium act of which banned the export of scarce helium on which the us then had a production monopoly together with the prohibitive cost of the gas the hindenburg like all german zeppelins was forced to use hydrogen as the lift gas the helium market after world war ii was depressed but the reserve was expanded in the s to ensure a supply of liquid helium as a coolant to create oxygen hydrogen rocket fuel among other uses during the space race and cold war helium use in the united states in was more than eight times the peak wartime consumption after the helium acts amendments of public law the u s bureau of mines arranged for five private plants to recover helium from natural gas for this helium conservation program the bureau built a mile km pipeline from bushton kansas to connect those plants with the government s partially depleted cliffside gas field near amarillo texas this helium nitrogen mixture was injected and stored in the cliffside gas field until needed at which time it was further purified by a billion cubic meters of the gas had been collected and the reserve was us billion in debt prompting the congress of the united states in to phase out the reserve the resulting helium privatization act of public law directed the united states department of the interior to empty the reserve with sales starting by helium produced between and was about pure nitrogen which was adequate for airships in a small amount of helium was produced for welding use by commercial quantities of grade a helium were available for many years the united states produced more than of commercially usable helium in the world while extraction plants in canada poland russia and other nations produced the remainder in the mid s a new plant in arzew algeria producing million cubic meters million cubic feet began operation with enough production to cover all of europe s demand meanwhile by the consumption of helium within the u s had risen to more than million kg per year in additional plants in ras laffan qatar and skikda algeria were built algeria quickly became the second leading producer of helium through this time both helium consumption and the costs of producing helium increased from to helium prices doubled as of the united states national helium reserve accounted for percent of the world s helium the reserve was expected to run out of helium in despite that a proposed bill in the united states senate would allow the reserve to continue to sell the gas other large reserves were in the hugoton in kansas united states and nearby gas fields of kansas and the panhandles of texas and oklahoma new helium plants were scheduled to open in in qatar russia and the us state of wyoming but they were not expected to ease the shortage in qatar started up the world s largest helium unit although the qatar diplomatic crisis severely affected helium production there was widely acknowledged to be a year of over supply in the helium business following years of renowned shortages nasdaq reported that for air products an international corporation that sells gases for industrial use helium volumes remain under economic pressure due to feedstock supply constraints characteristics atom in quantum mechanics in the perspective of quantum mechanics helium is the second simplest atom to model following the hydrogen atom helium is composed of two electrons in atomic orbitals surrounding a nucleus containing two protons and usually two neutrons as in newtonian mechanics no system that consists of more than two particles can be solved with an exact analytical mathematical approach see body problem and helium is no exception thus numerical mathematical methods are required even to solve the system of one nucleus and two electrons such computational chemistry methods have been used to create a quantum mechanical picture of helium electron binding which is accurate to within of the correct value in a few computational steps such models show that each electron in helium partly screens the nucleus from the other so that the effective nuclear charge z which each electron sees is about units not the charges of a classic bare helium nucleus related stability of the helium nucleus and electron shell the nucleus of the helium atom is identical with an alpha particle high energy electron scattering experiments show its charge to decrease exponentially from a maximum at a central point exactly as does the charge density of helium s own electron cloud this symmetry reflects similar underlying physics the pair of neutrons and the pair of protons in helium s nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules as do helium s pair of electrons although the nuclear particles are subject to a different nuclear binding potential so that all these fermions fully occupy s orbitals in pairs none of them possessing orbital angular momentum and each cancelling the other s intrinsic spin adding another of any of these particles would require angular momentum and would release substantially less energy in fact no nucleus with five nucleons is stable this arrangement is thus energetically extremely stable for all these particles and this stability accounts for many crucial facts regarding helium in nature for example the stability and low energy of the electron cloud state in helium accounts for the element s chemical inertness and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other producing the lowest melting and boiling points of all the elements in a similar way the particular energetic stability of the helium nucleus produced by similar effects accounts for the ease of helium production in atomic reactions that involve either heavy particle emission or fusion some stable helium protons and neutron is produced in fusion reactions from hydrogen but it is a very small fraction compared to the highly favorable helium the unusual stability of the helium nucleus is also important cosmologically it explains the fact that in the first few minutes after the big bang as the soup of free protons and neutrons which had initially been created in about ratio cooled to the point that nuclear binding was possible almost all first compound atomic nuclei to form were helium nuclei so tight was helium binding that helium production consumed nearly all of the free neutrons in a few minutes before they could beta decay and also leaving few to form heavier atoms such as lithium beryllium or boron helium nuclear binding per nucleon is stronger than in any of these elements see nucleogenesis and binding energy and thus once helium had been formed no energetic drive was available to make elements and it was barely energetically favorable for helium to fuse into the next element with a lower energy per nucleon carbon however due to lack of intermediate elements this process requires three helium nuclei striking each other nearly simultaneously see triple alpha process there was thus no time for significant carbon to be formed in the few minutes after the big bang before the early expanding universe cooled to the temperature and pressure point where helium fusion to carbon was no longer possible this left the early universe with a very similar ratio of hydrogen helium as is observed today parts hydrogen to part helium by mass with nearly all the neutrons in the universe trapped in helium all heavier elements including those necessary for rocky planets like the earth and for carbon based or other life have thus been created since the big bang in stars which were hot enough to fuse helium itself all elements other than hydrogen and helium today account for only of the mass of atomic matter in the universe helium by contrast makes up about of the universe s ordinary matter nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen gas and plasma phases helium is the second least reactive noble gas after neon and thus the second least reactive of all elements it is chemically inert and monatomic in all standard conditions because of helium s relatively low molar atomic mass its thermal conductivity specific heat and sound speed in the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen for these reasons and the small size of helium monatomic molecules helium diffuses through solids at a rate three times that of air and around that of hydrogen helium is the least water soluble monatomic gas and one of the least water soluble of any gas cf sf and c f have lower mole fraction solubilities and x respectively versus helium s x and helium s index of refraction is closer to unity than that of any other gas helium has a negative joule thomson coefficient at normal ambient temperatures meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand only below its joule thomson inversion temperature of about to k at atmosphere does it cool upon free expansion once precooled below this temperature helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling most extraterrestrial helium is found in a plasma state with properties quite different from those of atomic helium in a plasma helium s electrons are not bound to its nucleus resulting in very high electrical conductivity even when the gas is only partially ionized the charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields for example in the solar wind together with ionized hydrogen the particles interact with the earth s magnetosphere giving rise to birkeland currents and the aurora liquid phase unlike any other element helium will remain liquid down to absolute zero at normal pressures this is a direct effect of quantum mechanics specifically the zero point energy of the system is too high to allow freezing solid helium requires a temperature of k about c or f at about bar mpa of pressure it is often hard to distinguish solid from liquid helium since the refractive index of the two phases are nearly the same the solid has a sharp melting point and has a crystalline structure but it is highly compressible applying pressure in a laboratory can decrease its volume by more than with a bulk modulus of about mpa it is times more compressible than water solid helium has a density of g cm at k and atm the projected density at k and bar mpa is g cm at higher temperatures helium will solidify with sufficient pressure at room temperature this requires about atm helium i below its boiling point of k c f and above the lambda point of k c f the isotope helium exists in a normal colorless liquid state called helium i like other cryogenic liquids helium i boils when it is heated and contracts when its temperature is lowered below the lambda point however helium does not boil and it expands as the temperature is lowered further helium i has a gas like index of refraction of which makes its surface so hard to see that floats of styrofoam are often used to show where the surface is this colorless liquid has a very low viscosity and a density of g ml between about and k which is only one fourth the value expected from classical physics quantum mechanics is needed to explain this property and thus both states of liquid helium helium i and helium ii are called quantum fluids meaning they display atomic properties on a macroscopic scale this may be an effect of its boiling point being so close to absolute zero preventing random molecular motion thermal energy from masking the atomic properties helium ii liquid helium below its lambda point called helium ii exhibits very unusual characteristics due to its high thermal conductivity when it boils it does not bubble but rather evaporates directly from its surface helium also has a superfluid phase but only at much lower temperatures as a result less is known about the properties of the isotope helium ii is a superfluid a quantum mechanical state see macroscopic quantum phenomena of matter with strange properties for example when it flows through capillaries as thin as to m it has no measurable viscosity however when measurements were done between two moving discs a viscosity comparable to that of gaseous helium was observed current theory explains this using the two fluid model for helium ii in this model liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a ground state which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state which behave more like an ordinary fluid in the fountain effect a chamber is constructed which is connected to a reservoir of helium ii by a sintered disc through which superfluid helium leaks easily but through which non superfluid helium cannot pass if the interior of the container is heated the superfluid helium changes to non superfluid helium in order to maintain the equilibrium fraction of superfluid helium superfluid helium leaks through and increases the pressure causing liquid to fountain out of the container the thermal conductivity of helium ii is greater than that of any other known substance a million times that of helium i and several hundred times that of copper this is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional quantum mechanism most materials that conduct heat well have a valence band of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat helium ii has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well the flow of heat is governed by equations that are similar to the wave equation used to characterize sound propagation in air when heat is introduced it moves at meters per second at k through helium ii as waves in a phenomenon known as second sound helium ii also exhibits a creeping effect when a surface extends past the level of helium ii the helium ii moves along the surface against the force of gravity helium ii will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it evaporates it moves in a nm thick film regardless of surface material this film is called a rollin film and is named after the man who first characterized this trait bernard v rollin as a result of this creeping behavior and helium ii s ability to leak rapidly through tiny openings it is very difficult to confine unless the container is carefully constructed the helium ii will creep along the surfaces and through valves until it reaches somewhere warmer where it will evaporate waves propagating across a rollin film are governed by the same equation as gravity waves in shallow water but rather than gravity the restoring force is the van der waals force these waves are known as third sound isotopes there are nine known isotopes of helium but only helium and helium are stable in the earth s atmosphere one atom is he for every million that are he unlike most elements helium s isotopic abundance varies greatly by origin due to the different formation processes the most common isotope helium is produced on earth by alpha decay of heavier radioactive elements the alpha particles that emerge are fully ionized helium nuclei helium is an unusually stable nucleus because its nucleons are arranged into complete shells it was also formed in enormous quantities during big bang nucleosynthesis helium is present on earth only in trace amounts most of it has been present since earth s formation though some falls to earth trapped in cosmic dust trace amounts are also produced by the beta decay of tritium rocks from the earth s crust have isotope ratios varying by as much as a factor of ten and these ratios can be used to investigate the origin of rocks and the composition of the earth s mantle he is much more abundant in stars as a product of nuclear fusion thus in the interstellar medium the proportion of he to he is about times higher than on earth extraplanetary material such as lunar and asteroid regolith have trace amounts of helium from being bombarded by solar winds the moon s surface contains helium at concentrations on the order of ppb much higher than the approximately ppt found in the earth s atmosphere a number of people starting with gerald kulcinski in have proposed to explore the moon mine lunar regolith and use the helium for fusion liquid helium can be cooled to about k c f using evaporative cooling in a k pot similar cooling of helium which has a lower boiling point can achieve about kelvin in a helium refrigerator equal mixtures of liquid he and he below k separate into two immiscible phases due to their dissimilarity they follow different quantum statistics helium atoms are bosons while helium atoms are fermions dilution refrigerators use this immiscibility to achieve temperatures of a few millikelvins it is possible to produce exotic helium isotopes which rapidly decay into other substances the shortest lived heavy helium isotope is the unbound helium with a half life of s helium decays by emitting a beta particle and has a half life of second helium also emits a beta particle as well as a gamma ray helium and helium are created in certain nuclear reactions helium and helium are known to exhibit a nuclear halo properties table of thermal and physical properties of helium gas at atmospheric pressure compounds helium has a valence of zero and is chemically unreactive under all normal conditions it is an electrical insulator unless ionized as with the other noble gases helium has metastable energy levels that allow it to remain ionized in an electrical discharge with a voltage below its ionization potential helium can form unstable compounds known as excimers with tungsten iodine fluorine sulfur and phosphorus when it is subjected to a glow discharge to electron bombardment or reduced to plasma by other means the molecular compounds hene hghe and whe and the molecular ions he he heh and hed have been created this way heh is also stable in its ground state but is extremely reactive it is the strongest br nsted acid known and therefore can exist only in isolation as it will protonate any molecule or counteranion it contacts this technique has also produced the neutral molecule he which has a large number of band systems and hghe which is apparently held together only by polarization forces van der waals compounds of helium can also be formed with cryogenic helium gas and atoms of some other substance such as lihe and he theoretically other true compounds may be possible such as helium fluorohydride hhef which would be analogous to harf discovered in calculations show that two new compounds containing a helium oxygen bond could be stable two new molecular species predicted using theory csfheo and n ch fheo are derivatives of a metastable fheo anion first theorized in by a group from taiwan if confirmed by experiment the only remaining element with no known stable compounds would be neon helium atoms have been inserted into the hollow carbon cage molecules the fullerenes by heating under high pressure the endohedral fullerene molecules formed are stable at high temperatures when chemical derivatives of these fullerenes are formed the helium stays inside if helium is used it can be readily observed by helium nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy many fullerenes containing helium have been reported although the helium atoms are not attached by covalent or ionic bonds these substances have distinct properties and a definite composition like all stoichiometric chemical compounds under high pressures helium can form compounds with various other elements helium nitrogen clathrate he n crystals have been grown at room temperature at pressures ca gpa in a diamond anvil cell the insulating electride na he has been shown to be thermodynamically stable at pressures above gpa it has a fluorite structure occurrence and production natural abundance although it is rare on earth helium is the second most abundant element in the known universe constituting of its baryonic mass only hydrogen is more abundant the vast majority of helium was formed by big bang nucleosynthesis one to three minutes after the big bang as such measurements of its abundance contribute to cosmological models in stars it is formed by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in proton proton chain reactions and the cno cycle part of stellar nucleosynthesis in the earth s atmosphere the concentration of helium by volume is only parts per million the concentration is low and fairly constant despite the continuous production of new helium because most helium in the earth s atmosphere escapes into space by several processes in the earth s heterosphere a part of the upper atmosphere helium and other lighter gases are the most abundant elements most helium on earth is a result of radioactive decay helium is found in large amounts in minerals of uranium and thorium including uraninite and its varieties cleveite and pitchblende carnotite and monazite a group name monazite usually refers to monazite ce because they emit alpha particles helium nuclei he to which electrons immediately combine as soon as the particle is stopped by the rock in this way an estimated metric tons of helium are generated per year throughout the lithosphere in the earth s crust the concentration of helium is parts per billion in seawater the concentration is only parts per trillion there are also small amounts in mineral springs volcanic gas and meteoric iron because helium is trapped in the subsurface under conditions that also trap natural gas the greatest natural concentrations of helium on the planet are found in natural gas from which most commercial helium is extracted the concentration varies in a broad range from a few ppm to more than in a small gas field in san juan county new mexico as of the world s helium reserves were estimated at billion cubic meters with a third of that being in qatar in and additional probable reserves were announced to be under the rocky mountains in north america and in the east african rift modern extraction and distribution for large scale use helium is extracted by fractional distillation from natural gas which can contain as much as helium since helium has a lower boiling point than any other element low temperature and high pressure are used to liquefy nearly all the other gases mostly nitrogen and methane the resulting crude helium gas is purified by successive exposures to lowering temperatures in which almost all of the remaining nitrogen and other gases are precipitated out of the gaseous mixture activated charcoal is used as a final purification step usually resulting in pure grade a helium the principal impurity in grade a helium is neon in a final production step most of the helium that is produced is liquefied via a cryogenic process this is necessary for applications requiring liquid helium and also allows helium suppliers to reduce the cost of long distance transportation as the largest liquid helium containers have more than five times the capacity of the largest gaseous helium tube trailers in approximately million standard cubic meters scm of helium were extracted from natural gas or withdrawn from helium reserves with approximately from the united states from algeria and most of the remainder from russia poland and qatar by increases in helium production in qatar under the company qatargas managed by air liquide had increased qatar s fraction of world helium production to and made it the second largest exporter after the united states an estimated billion cubic feet m deposit of helium was found in tanzania in a large scale helium plant was opened in ningxia china in in the united states most helium is extracted from natural gas of the hugoton and nearby gas fields in kansas oklahoma and the panhandle field in texas much of this gas was once sent by pipeline to the national helium reserve but since this reserve is being depleted and sold off and is expected to be largely depleted by under the october responsible helium administration and stewardship act h r diffusion of crude natural gas through special semipermeable membranes and other barriers is another method to recover and purify helium in the u s had proven helium reserves in such gas well complexes of about billion standard cubic feet billion scm at rates of use at that time million scm per year in the u s see pie chart below this would have been enough helium for about years of u s use and less than this perhaps of the time at world use rates although factors in saving and processing impact effective reserve numbers helium must be extracted from natural gas because it is present in air at only a fraction of that of neon yet the demand for it is far higher it is estimated that if all neon production were retooled to save helium of the world s helium demands would be satisfied similarly only of the world s helium demands could be satisfied by re tooling all air distillation plants helium can be synthesized by bombardment of lithium or boron with high velocity protons or by bombardment of lithium with deuterons but these processes are a completely uneconomical method of production helium is commercially available in either liquid or gaseous form as a liquid it can be supplied in small insulated containers called dewars which hold as much as liters of helium or in large iso containers which have nominal capacities as large as m around u s gallons in gaseous form small quantities of helium are supplied in high pressure cylinders holding as much as m approx standard cubic feet while large quantities of high pressure gas are supplied in tube trailers which have capacities of as much as m approx standard cubic feet conservation advocates according to helium conservationists like nobel laureate physicist robert coleman richardson writing in the free market price of helium has contributed to wasteful usage e g for helium balloons prices in the s had been lowered by the decision of the u s congress to sell off the country s large helium stockpile by according to richardson the price needed to be multiplied by to eliminate the excessive wasting of helium in the paper stop squandering helium published in it was also proposed to create an international helium agency that would build a sustainable market for this precious commodity applications while balloons are perhaps the best known use of helium they are a minor part of all helium use helium is used for many purposes that require some of its unique properties such as its low boiling point low density low solubility high thermal conductivity or inertness of the world helium total production of about million kg million standard cubic meters helium per year the largest use about of the total in is in cryogenic applications most of which involves cooling the superconducting magnets in medical mri scanners and nmr spectrometers other major uses were pressurizing and purging systems welding maintenance of controlled atmospheres and leak detection other uses by category were relatively minor fractions controlled atmospheres helium is used as a protective gas in growing silicon and germanium crystals in titanium and zirconium production and in gas chromatography because it is inert because of its inertness thermally and calorically perfect nature high speed of sound and high value of the heat capacity ratio it is also useful in supersonic wind tunnels and impulse facilities gas tungsten arc welding helium is used as a shielding gas in arc welding processes on materials that at welding temperatures are contaminated and weakened by air or nitrogen a number of inert shielding gases are used in gas tungsten arc welding but helium is used instead of cheaper argon especially for welding materials that have higher heat conductivity like aluminium or copper minor uses industrial leak detection one industrial application for helium is leak detection because helium diffuses through solids three times faster than air it is used as a tracer gas to detect leaks in high vacuum equipment such as cryogenic tanks and high pressure containers the tested object is placed in a chamber which is then evacuated and filled with helium the helium that escapes through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device helium mass spectrometer even at the leak rates as small as mbar l s pa m s the measurement procedure is normally automatic and is called helium integral test a simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand held device helium leaks through cracks should not be confused with gas permeation through a bulk material while helium has documented permeation constants thus a calculable permeation rate through glasses ceramics and synthetic materials inert gases such as helium will not permeate most bulk metals flight because it is lighter than air airships and balloons are inflated with helium for lift while hydrogen gas is more buoyant and escapes permeating through a membrane at a lower rate helium has the advantage of being non flammable and indeed fire retardant another minor use is in rocketry where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel it is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles for example the saturn v rocket used in the apollo program needed about m million cubic feet of helium to launch minor commercial and recreational uses helium as a breathing gas has no narcotic properties so helium mixtures such as trimix heliox and heliair are used for deep diving to reduce the effects of narcosis which worsen with increasing depth as pressure increases with depth the density of the breathing gas also increases and the low molecular weight of helium is found to considerably reduce the effort of breathing by lowering the density of the mixture this reduces the reynolds number of flow leading to a reduction of turbulent flow and an increase in laminar flow which requires less work of breathing at depths below metres ft divers breathing helium oxygen mixtures begin to experience tremors and a decrease in psychomotor function symptoms of high pressure nervous syndrome this effect may be countered to some extent by adding an amount of narcotic gas such as hydrogen or nitrogen to a helium oxygen mixture helium neon lasers a type of low powered gas laser producing a red beam had various practical applications which included barcode readers and laser pointers before they were almost universally replaced by cheaper diode lasers for its inertness and high thermal conductivity neutron transparency and because it does not form radioactive isotopes under reactor conditions helium is used as a heat transfer medium in some gas cooled nuclear reactors helium mixed with a heavier gas such as xenon is useful for thermoacoustic refrigeration due to the resulting high heat capacity ratio and low prandtl number the inertness of helium has environmental advantages over conventional refrigeration systems which contribute to ozone depletion or global warming helium is also used in some hard disk drives scientific uses the use of helium reduces the distorting effects of temperature variations in the space between lenses in some telescopes due to its extremely low index of refraction this method is especially used in solar telescopes where a vacuum tight telescope tube would be too heavy helium is a commonly used carrier gas for gas chromatography the age of rocks and minerals that contain uranium and thorium can be estimated by measuring the level of helium with a process known as helium dating helium at low temperatures is used in cryogenics and in certain cryogenics applications as examples of applications liquid helium is used to cool certain metals to the extremely low temperatures required for superconductivity such as in superconducting magnets for magnetic resonance imaging the large hadron collider at cern uses metric tons of liquid helium to maintain the temperature at k c f medical uses helium was approved for medical use in the united states in april for humans and animals as a contaminant while chemically inert helium contamination impairs the operation of microelectromechanical systems mems such that iphones may fail inhalation and safety effects neutral helium at standard conditions is non toxic plays no biological role and is found in trace amounts in human blood the speed of sound in helium is nearly three times the speed of sound in air because the natural resonance frequency of a gas filled cavity is proportional to the speed of sound in the gas when helium is inhaled a corresponding increase occurs in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract which is the amplifier of vocal sound this increase in the resonant frequency of the amplifier the vocal tract gives an increased amplification to the high frequency components of the sound wave produced by the direct vibration of the vocal folds compared to the case when the voice box is filled with air when a person speaks after inhaling helium gas the muscles that control the voice box still move in the same way as when the voice box is filled with air therefore the fundamental frequency sometimes called pitch produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds does not change however the high frequency preferred amplification causes a change in timbre of the amplified sound resulting in a reedy duck like vocal quality the opposite effect lowering resonant frequencies can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon hazards inhaling helium can be dangerous if done to excess since helium is a simple asphyxiant and so displaces oxygen needed for normal respiration fatalities have been recorded including a youth who suffocated in vancouver in and two adults who suffocated in south florida in in an australian girl from victoria fell unconscious and temporarily turned blue after inhaling the entire contents of a party balloon inhaling helium directly from pressurized cylinders or even balloon filling valves is extremely dangerous as high flow rate and pressure can result in barotrauma fatally rupturing lung tissue death caused by helium is rare the first media recorded case was that of a year old girl from texas who died in from helium inhalation at a friend s party the exact type of helium death is unidentified in the united states only two fatalities were reported between and including a man who died in north carolina of barotrauma in a youth asphyxiated in vancouver during and a year old man in australia had an embolism after breathing from a cylinder in since then two adults asphyxiated in south florida in and there were cases in and one a californian youth who was found with a bag over his head attached to a helium tank and another teenager in northern ireland died of asphyxiation at eagle point oregon a teenage girl died in from barotrauma at a party a girl from michigan died from hypoxia later in the year on february it was revealed that during the recording of their main tv show on january a year old member name withheld of japanese all girl singing group b junior suffered from air embolism losing consciousness and falling into a coma as a result of air bubbles blocking the flow of blood to the brain after inhaling huge quantities of helium as part of a game the incident was not made public until a week later the staff of tv asahi held an emergency press conference to communicate that the member had been taken to the hospital and is showing signs of rehabilitation such as moving eyes and limbs but her consciousness has not yet been sufficiently recovered police have launched an investigation due to a neglect of safety measures the safety issues for cryogenic helium are similar to those of liquid nitrogen its extremely low temperatures can result in cold burns and the liquid to gas expansion ratio can cause explosions if no pressure relief devices are installed containers of helium gas at to k should be handled as if they contain liquid helium due to the rapid and significant thermal expansion that occurs when helium gas at less than k is warmed to room temperature at high pressures more than about atm or two mpa a mixture of helium and oxygen heliox can lead to high pressure nervous syndrome a sort of reverse anesthetic effect adding a small amount of nitrogen to the mixture can alleviate the problem ,2
Lithium,Li,lithium from greek romanized lithos lit stone is a chemical element with the symbol li and atomic number it is a soft silvery white alkali metal under standard conditions it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element like all alkali metals lithium is highly reactive and flammable and must be stored in vacuum inert atmosphere or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil when cut it exhibits a metallic luster but moist air corrodes it quickly to a dull silvery gray then black tarnish it never occurs freely in nature but only in usually ionic compounds such as pegmatitic minerals which were once the main source of lithium due to its solubility as an ion it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride the nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides because of its relative nuclear instability lithium is less common in the solar system than of the first chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common for related reasons lithium has important uses in nuclear physics the transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in was the first fully man made nuclear reaction and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons lithium and its compounds have several industrial applications including heat resistant glass and ceramics lithium grease lubricants flux additives for iron steel and aluminium production lithium metal batteries and lithium ion batteries these uses consume more than three quarters of lithium production lithium is present in biological systems in trace amounts its functions are uncertain lithium salts have proven to be useful as a mood stabilizer and antidepressant in the treatment of mental illness such as bipolar disorder properties atomic and physical the alkali metals are also called the lithium family after its leading element like the other alkali metals which are sodium na potassium k rubidium rb caesium cs and francium fr lithium has a single valence electron that is easily given up to form a cation because of this lithium is a good conductor of heat and electricity as well as a highly reactive element though it is the least reactive of the alkali metals lithium s low reactivity is due to the proximity of its valence electron to its nucleus the remaining two electrons are in the s orbital much lower in energy and do not participate in chemical bonds molten lithium is significantly more reactive than its solid form lithium metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife when cut it possesses a silvery white color that quickly changes to gray as it oxidizes to lithium oxide its melting point of c k f and its boiling point of c k f are each the highest of all the alkali metals while its density of g cm is the lowest lithium has a very low density g cm comparable with pine wood it is the least dense of all elements that are solids at room temperature the next lightest solid element potassium at g cm is more than denser apart from helium and hydrogen as a solid it is less dense than any other element as a liquid being only two thirds as dense as liquid nitrogen g cm lithium can float on the lightest hydrocarbon oils and is one of only three metals that can float on water the other two being sodium and potassium lithium s coefficient of thermal expansion is twice that of aluminium and almost four times that of iron lithium is superconductive below k at standard pressure and at higher temperatures more than k at very high pressures gpa at temperatures below k lithium like sodium undergoes diffusionless phase change transformations at k it has a rhombohedral crystal system with a nine layer repeat spacing at higher temperatures it transforms to face centered cubic and then body centered cubic at liquid helium temperatures k the rhombohedral structure is prevalent multiple allotropic forms have been identified for lithium at high pressures lithium has a mass specific heat capacity of kilojoules per kilogram kelvin the highest of all solids because of this lithium metal is often used in coolants for heat transfer applications isotopes naturally occurring lithium is composed of two stable isotopes li and li the latter being the more abundant natural abundance both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon compared to the neighboring elements on the periodic table helium and beryllium lithium is the only low numbered element that can produce net energy through nuclear fission the two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than deuterium and helium as a result of this though very light in atomic weight lithium is less common in the solar system than of the first chemical elements seven radioisotopes have been characterized the most stable being li with a half life of ms and li with a half life of ms all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are shorter than ms the shortest lived isotope of lithium is li which decays through proton emission and has a half life of s the li isotope is one of only five stable nuclides to have both an odd number of protons and an odd number of neutrons the other four stable odd odd nuclides being hydrogen boron nitrogen and tantalum m li is one of the primordial elements or more properly primordial nuclides produced in big bang nucleosynthesis a small amount of both li and li are produced in stars during stellar nucleosynthesis but it is further burned as fast as produced li can also be generated in carbon stars additional small amounts of both li and li may be generated from solar wind cosmic rays hitting heavier atoms and from early solar system be and be radioactive decay lithium isotopes fractionate substantially during a wide variety of natural processes including mineral formation chemical precipitation metabolism and ion exchange lithium ions substitute for magnesium and iron in octahedral sites in clay minerals where li is preferred to li resulting in enrichment of the light isotope in processes of hyperfiltration and rock alteration the exotic li is known to exhibit a neutron halo with neutrons orbiting around its nucleus of protons and neutrons the process known as laser isotope separation can be used to separate lithium isotopes in particular li from li nuclear weapons manufacture and other nuclear physics applications are a major source of artificial lithium fractionation with the light isotope li being retained by industry and military stockpiles to such an extent that it has caused slight but measurable change in the li to li ratios in natural sources such as rivers this has led to unusual uncertainty in the standardized atomic weight of lithium since this quantity depends on the natural abundance ratios of these naturally occurring stable lithium isotopes as they are available in commercial lithium mineral sources both stable isotopes of lithium can be laser cooled and were used to produce the first quantum degenerate bose fermi mixture occurrence astronomical although it was synthesized in the big bang lithium together with beryllium and boron is markedly less abundant in the universe than other elements this is a result of the comparatively low stellar temperatures necessary to destroy lithium along with a lack of common processes to produce it according to modern cosmological theory lithium in both stable isotopes lithium and lithium was one of the three elements synthesized in the big bang though the amount of lithium generated in big bang nucleosynthesis is dependent upon the number of photons per baryon for accepted values the lithium abundance can be calculated and there is a cosmological lithium discrepancy in the universe older stars seem to have less lithium than they should and some younger stars have much more the lack of lithium in older stars is apparently caused by the mixing of lithium into the interior of stars where it is destroyed while lithium is produced in younger stars although it transmutes into two atoms of helium due to collision with a proton at temperatures above million degrees celsius most stars easily attain this temperature in their interiors lithium is more abundant than computations would predict in later generation stars lithium is also found in brown dwarf substellar objects and certain anomalous orange stars because lithium is present in cooler less massive brown dwarfs but is destroyed in hotter red dwarf stars its presence in the stars spectra can be used in the lithium test to differentiate the two as both are smaller than the sun certain orange stars can also contain a high concentration of lithium those orange stars found to have a higher than usual concentration of lithium such as centaurus x orbit massive objects neutron stars or black holes whose gravity evidently pulls heavier lithium to the surface of a hydrogen helium star causing more lithium to be observed on may astronomers reported that classical nova explosions are galactic producers of lithium terrestrial although lithium is widely distributed on earth it does not naturally occur in elemental form due to its high reactivity the total lithium content of seawater is very large and is estimated as billion tonnes where the element exists at a relatively constant concentration of to parts per million ppm or micromolar higher concentrations approaching ppm are found near hydrothermal vents estimates for the earth s crustal content range from to ppm by weight lithium constitutes about percent of earth s crust in keeping with its name lithium forms a minor part of igneous rocks with the largest concentrations in granites granitic pegmatites also provide the greatest abundance of lithium containing minerals with spodumene and petalite being the most commercially viable sources another significant mineral of lithium is lepidolite which is now an obsolete name for a series formed by polylithionite and trilithionite a newer source for lithium is hectorite clay the only active development of which is through the western lithium corporation in the united states at mg lithium per kg of earth s crust lithium is the th most abundant element according to the handbook of lithium and natural calcium lithium is a comparatively rare element although it is found in many rocks and some brines but always in very low concentrations there are a fairly large number of both lithium mineral and brine deposits but only comparatively few of them are of actual or potential commercial value many are very small others are too low in grade chile is estimated to have the largest reserves by far million tonnes and australia the highest annual production tonnes one of the largest reserve bases of lithium is in the salar de uyuni area of bolivia which has million tonnes other major suppliers include australia argentina and china as of the czech geological survey considered the entire ore mountains in the czech republic as lithium province five deposits are registered one near c novec is considered as a potentially economical deposit with tonnes of lithium in december finnish mining company keliber oy reported its rapasaari lithium deposit has estimated proven and probable ore reserves of million tonnes in june the new york times reported that american geologists were conducting ground surveys on dry salt lakes in western afghanistan believing that large deposits of lithium are located there these estimates are based principally on old data which was gathered mainly by the soviets during their occupation of afghanistan from the department of defense estimated the lithium reserves in afghanistan to amount to the ones in bolivia and dubbed it as a potential saudi arabia of lithium in cornwall england the presence of brine rich in lithium was well known due to the region s historic mining industry and private investors have conducted tests to investigate potential lithium extraction in this area biological lithium is found in trace amount in numerous plants plankton and invertebrates at concentrations of to parts per billion ppb in vertebrates the concentration is slightly lower and nearly all vertebrate tissue and body fluids contain lithium ranging from to ppb marine organisms tend to bioaccumulate lithium more than terrestrial organisms whether lithium has a physiological role in any of these organisms is unknown studies of lithium concentrations in mineral rich soil give ranges between around and ppm with some concentrations as high as ppm although it is unlikely that all of it is available for uptake by plants lithium concentration in plant tissue is typically around ppm with some plant families bioaccumulating more lithium than others lithium accumulation does not appear to affect the essential nutrient composition of plants tolerance to lithium varies by plant species and typically parallels sodium tolerance maize and rhodes grass for example are highly tolerant to lithium injury while avocado and soybean are very sensitive similarly lithium at concentrations of ppm reduces seed germination in some species e g asian rice and chickpea but not in others e g barley and wheat many of lithium s major biological effects can be explained by its competition with other ions the monovalent lithium ion li competes with other ions such as sodium immediately below lithium on the periodic table which like lithium is also a monovalent alkali metal lithium also competes with bivalent magnesium ions whose ionic radius pm is approximately that of the lithium ion pm mechanisms that transport sodium across cellular membranes also transport lithium for instance sodium channels both voltage gated and epithelial are particularly major pathways of entry for lithium lithium ions can also permeate through ligand gated ion channels as well as cross both nuclear and mitochondrial membranes like sodium lithium can enter and partially block although not permeate potassium channels and calcium channels the biological effects of lithium are many and varied but its mechanisms of action are only partially understood for instance studies of lithium treated patients with bipolar disorder show that among many other effects lithium partially reverses telomere shortening in these patients and also increases mitochondrial function although how lithium produces these pharmacological effects is not understood even the exact mechanisms involved in lithium toxicity are not fully understood history petalite lialsi o was discovered in by the brazilian chemist and statesman jos bonif cio de andrada e silva in a mine on the island of ut sweden however it was not until that johan august arfwedson then working in the laboratory of the chemist j ns jakob berzelius detected the presence of a new element while analyzing petalite ore this element formed compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium though its carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble in water and less alkaline berzelius gave the alkaline material the name lithion lithina from the greek word o transliterated as lithos meaning stone to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral as opposed to potassium which had been discovered in plant ashes and sodium which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood he named the metal inside the material lithium arfwedson later showed that this same element was present in the minerals spodumene and lepidolite in christian gmelin was the first to observe that lithium salts give a bright red color to flame however both arfwedson and gmelin tried and failed to isolate the pure element from its salts it was not isolated until when william thomas brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide a process that had previously been employed by the chemist sir humphry davy to isolate the alkali metals potassium and sodium brande also described some pure salts of lithium such as the chloride and estimating that lithia lithium oxide contained about metal estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around g mol modern value g mol in larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by robert bunsen and augustus matthiessen the discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in by the german company metallgesellschaft ag which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride australian psychiatrist john cade is credited with reintroducing and popularizing the use of lithium to treat mania in shortly after throughout the mid th century lithium s mood stabilizing applicability for mania and depression took off in europe and the united states the production and use of lithium underwent several drastic changes in history the first major application of lithium was in high temperature lithium greases for aircraft engines and similar applications in world war ii and shortly after this use was supported by the fact that lithium based soaps have a higher melting point than other alkali soaps and are less corrosive than calcium based soaps the small demand for lithium soaps and lubricating greases was supported by several small mining operations mostly in the us the demand for lithium increased dramatically during the cold war with the production of nuclear fusion weapons both lithium and lithium produce tritium when irradiated by neutrons and are thus useful for the production of tritium by itself as well as a form of solid fusion fuel used inside hydrogen bombs in the form of lithium deuteride the us became the prime producer of lithium between the late s and the mid s at the end the stockpile of lithium was roughly tonnes of lithium hydroxide the stockpiled lithium was depleted in lithium by which was enough to affect the measured atomic weight of lithium in many standardized chemicals and even the atomic weight of lithium in some natural sources of lithium ion which had been contaminated by lithium salts discharged from isotope separation facilities which had found its way into ground water lithium is used to decrease the melting temperature of glass and to improve the melting behavior of aluminium oxide in the hall h roult process these two uses dominated the market until the middle of the s after the end of the nuclear arms race the demand for lithium decreased and the sale of department of energy stockpiles on the open market further reduced prices in the mid s several companies started to isolate lithium from brine which proved to be a less expensive option than underground or open pit mining most of the mines closed or shifted their focus to other materials because only the ore from zoned pegmatites could be mined for a competitive price for example the us mines near kings mountain north carolina closed before the beginning of the st century the development of lithium ion batteries increased the demand for lithium and became the dominant use in with the surge of lithium demand in batteries in the s new companies have expanded brine isolation efforts to meet the rising demand it has been argued that lithium will be one of the main objects of geopolitical competition in a world running on renewable energy and dependent on batteries but this perspective has also been criticised for underestimating the power of economic incentives for expanded production chemistry of lithium metal lithium reacts with water easily but with noticeably less vigor than other alkali metals the reaction forms hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide when placed over a flame lithium compounds give off a striking crimson color but when the metal burns strongly the flame becomes a brilliant silver lithium will ignite and burn in oxygen when exposed to water or water vapor in moist air lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of lithium hydroxide lioh and lioh h o lithium nitride li n and lithium carbonate li co the result of a secondary reaction between lioh and co lithium is one of the few metals that react with nitrogen gas because of its reactivity with water and especially nitrogen lithium metal is usually stored in a hydrocarbon sealant often petroleum jelly although the heavier alkali metals can be stored under mineral oil lithium is not dense enough to fully submerge itself in these liquids lithium has a diagonal relationship with magnesium an element of similar atomic and ionic radius chemical resemblances between the two metals include the formation of a nitride by reaction with n the formation of an oxide li o and peroxide li o when burnt in o salts with similar solubilities and thermal instability of the carbonates and nitrides the metal reacts with hydrogen gas at high temperatures to produce lithium hydride lih lithium forms a variety of binary and ternary materials by direct reaction with the main group elements these zintl phases although highly covalent can be viewed as salts of polyatomic anions such as si p and te with graphite lithium forms a variety of intercalation compounds it dissolves in ammonia and amines to give li nh and the solvated electron inorganic compounds lithium forms salt like derivatives with all halides and pseudohalides some examples include the halides lif licl libr lii as well as the pseudohalides and related anions lithium carbonate has been described as the most important compound of lithium this white solid is the principal product of beneficiation of lithium ores it is a precursor to other salts including ceramics and materials for lithium batteries the compounds libh and lialh are useful reagents these salts and many other lithium salts exhibit distinctively high solubility in ethers in contrast with salts of heavier alkali metals in aqueous solution the coordination complex li h o predominates for many lithium salts related complexes are known with amines and ethers organic chemistry organolithium compounds are numerous and useful they are defined by the presence of a bond between carbon and lithium they serve as metal stabilized carbanions although their solution and solid state structures are more complex than this simplistic view thus these are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles they have also been applied in asymmetric synthesis in the pharmaceutical industry for laboratory organic synthesis many organolithium reagents are commercially available in solution form these reagents are highly reactive and are sometimes pyrophoric like its inorganic compounds almost all organic compounds of lithium formally follow the duet rule e g buli meli however it is important to note that in the absence of coordinating solvents or ligands organolithium compounds form dimeric tetrameric and hexameric clusters e g buli is actually buli and meli is actually meli which feature multi center bonding and increase the coordination number around lithium these clusters are broken down into smaller or monomeric units in the presence of solvents like dimethoxyethane dme or ligands like tetramethylethylenediamine tmeda as an exception to the duet rule a two coordinate lithate complex with four electrons around lithium li thf me si c li has been characterized crystallographically production lithium production has greatly increased since the end of world war ii the main sources of lithium are brines and ores lithium metal is produced through electrolysis applied to a mixture of fused lithium chloride and potassium chloride at about c reserves and occurrence the us geological survey usgs estimated worldwide identified lithium reserves in and to be million and million tonnes respectively an accurate estimate of world lithium reserves is difficult one reason for this is that most lithium classification schemes are developed for solid ore deposits whereas brine is a fluid that is problematic to treat with the same classification scheme due to varying concentrations and pumping effects following a hike in lithium price in and concern for insufficiency of lithium resource for the growing lithium ion battery industry a peer reviewed analysis of usgs data in predicted that there will be no shortage of lithium and current estimates of reserves will increase along with the demand worldwide lithium resources identified by usgs started to increase in owing to continuing exploration identified resources in and were and million tonnes respectively in the world was estimated to contain about million tonnes of lithium reserves while million tonnes of known resources were reasonable of lithium reserves could be found in the ten largest deposits of the world another study noted that of the geological resources of lithium are located in six brine two pegmatite and two sedimentary deposits in the us lithium is recovered from brine pools in nevada a deposit discovered in in wyoming s rock springs uplift is estimated to contain tons additional deposits in the same formation were estimated to be as much as million tons similarly in nevada the mcdermitt caldera hosts lithium bearing volcanic muds that consist of the largest known deposits of lithium within the united states lithium triangle the world s top four lithium producing countries from as reported by the us geological survey are australia chile china and argentina the three countries of chile bolivia and argentina make up a region known as the lithium triangle the lithium triangle is known for its high quality salt flats which include bolivia s salar de uyuni chile s salar de atacama and argentina s salar de arizaro the lithium triangle is believed to contain over of existing known lithium reserves deposits are also found in south america throughout the andes mountain chain chile is the leading producer followed by argentina both countries recover lithium from brine pools according to usgs bolivia s uyuni desert has million tonnes of lithium half the world s known reserves are located in bolivia along the central eastern slope of the andes the bolivian government has invested us million and in successfully produced tons the brines in the salt pans of the lithium triangle vary widely in lithium content concentrations can also vary in time as brines are fluids that are changeable and mobile since the democratic republic of congo is known to have the largest lithium spodumene hard rock deposit in the world the deposit located in manono drc may hold up to billion tons of lithium spodumene hard rock the two largest pegmatites known as the carriere de l este pegmatite and the roche dure pegmatite are each of similar size or larger than the famous greenbushes pegmatite in western australia thus the democratic republic of congo is expected to be a significant supplier of lithium to the world with its high grade and low impurities according to a later study by lawrence berkeley national laboratory and the university of california berkeley the then estimated reserve base of lithium should not be a limiting factor for large scale battery production for electric vehicles because an estimated billion kwh li based batteries could be built with those reserves about kg of lithium per car another study at the university of michigan and ford motor company found enough resources to support global demand until including the lithium required for the potential widespread transportation use the study estimated global reserves at million tons and total demand for lithium during the year period annualized at million tons depending on the scenarios regarding economic growth and recycling rates in the financialist stated that demand for lithium was growing at more than a year according to credit suisse this rate exceeded projected availability by the publication compared the lithium situation with oil whereby higher oil prices spurred investment in expensive deepwater and oil sands production techniques that is the price of lithium would continue to rise until more expensive production methods that could boost total output would receive the attention of investors on july million tonnes of high grade lithium resources and million pounds of uranium resources were found in the falchani hard rock deposit in the region puno peru in australia granted major project status mps to the finniss lithium project for a strategically important lithium deposit an estimated million tonnes mt of mineral resource at percent lithium oxide operational mining began in in world production of lithium from spodumene was around t per annum primarily from the greenbushes pegmatite and from some chinese and chilean sources the talison mine in greenbushes is reported to be the largest and to have the highest grade of ore at li o figures oceans are estimated to contain billion tons of lithium but the concentration is ppm making it more expensive to isolate with technology than from land based brine and rock sources another potential source of lithium as of was identified as the leachates of geothermal wells which are carried to the surface recovery of this type of lithium has been demonstrated in the field the lithium is separated by simple filtration reserves are more limited than those of brine reservoirs and hard rock pricing in the price of lithium metal was about usd kg or us lb after the financial crisis major suppliers such as sociedad qu mica y minera sqm dropped lithium carbonate pricing by prices rose in a business week article outlined an oligopoly in the lithium space sqm controlled by billionaire julio ponce is the second largest followed by rockwood which is backed by henry kravis s kkr co and philadelphia based fmc with talison mentioned as the biggest producer global consumption may jump to metric tons a year by from about tons in to match the demand for lithium batteries that has been growing at about a year outpacing the to overall gain in lithium production the price information service ise institute of

and its compounds were historically isolated and extracted from hard rock but by the s mineral springs brine pools and brine deposits had become the dominant source most of these were in chile argentina and bolivia large lithium clay deposits under development in the mcdermitt caldera nevada usa require concentrated sulfuric acid to leach lithium from the clay ore by early much of the lithium mined globally comes from either spodumene the mineral contained in hard rocks found in places such as australia and north carolina or from the salty brine pumped directly out of the ground as it is in locations in chile in chile s salar de atacama the lithium concentration in the brine is raised by solar evaporation in a system of ponds the enrichment by evaporation process may require up to one and a half years when the brine reaches a lithium content of the final processing in this example is done near the city of antofagasta on the coast where pure lithium carbonate lithium hydroxide and lithium chloride are produced from the brine low cobalt cathodes for lithium batteries are expected to require lithium hydroxide rather than lithium carbonate as a feedstock and this trend favors rock as a source the use of electrodialysis and electrochemical intercalation has been proposed to extract lithium compounds from seawater which contains lithium at parts per million but it is not yet commercially viable environmental issues the manufacturing processes of lithium including the solvent and mining waste presents significant environmental and health hazards lithium extraction can be fatal to aquatic life due to water pollution it is known to cause surface water contamination drinking water contamination respiratory problems ecosystem degradation and landscape damage it also leads to unsustainable water consumption in arid regions million liters per ton of lithium massive byproduct generation of lithium extraction also presents unsolved problems such as large amounts of magnesium and lime waste in the united states there is active competition between environmentally catastrophic open pit mining mountaintop removal mining and less damaging brine extraction mining in an effort to drastically expand domestic lithium mining capacity environmental concerns include wildlife habitat degradation potable water pollution including arsenic and antimony contamination unsustainable water table reduction and massive mining waste including radioactive uranium byproduct and sulfuric acid discharge human rights issues a study of relationships between lithium extraction companies and indigenous peoples in argentina indicated that the state may not have protected indigenous peoples right to free prior and informed consent and that extraction companies generally controlled community access to information and set the terms for discussion of the projects and benefit sharing development of the thacker pass lithium mine in nevada usa has met with protests and lawsuits from several indigenous tribes who have said they were not provided free prior and informed consent and that the project threatens cultural and sacred sites they have also expressed concerns that development of the project will create risks to indigenous women because resource extraction is linked to missing and murdered indigenous women protestors have been occupying the site of the proposed mine since january applications batteries in most lithium is used to make lithium ion batteries for electric cars and mobile devices ceramics and glass lithium oxide is widely used as a flux for processing silica reducing the melting point and viscosity of the material and leading to glazes with improved physical properties including low coefficients of thermal expansion worldwide this is one of the largest use for lithium compounds glazes containing lithium oxides are used for ovenware lithium carbonate li co is generally used in this application because it converts to the oxide upon heating electrical and electronic late in the th century lithium became an important component of battery electrolytes and electrodes because of its high electrode potential because of its low atomic mass it has a high charge and power to weight ratio a typical lithium ion battery can generate approximately volts per cell compared with volts for lead acid and volts for zinc carbon lithium ion batteries which are rechargeable and have a high energy density differ from lithium metal batteries which are disposable primary batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium ion polymer battery lithium iron phosphate battery and the nanowire battery over the years opinions have been differing about potential growth a study concluded that realistically achievable lithium carbonate production would be sufficient for only a small fraction of future phev and ev global market requirements that demand from the portable electronics sector will absorb much of the planned production increases in the next decade and that mass production of lithium carbonate is not environmentally sound it will cause irreparable ecological damage to ecosystems that should be protected and that liion propulsion is incompatible with the notion of the green car lubricating greases the third most common use of lithium is in greases lithium hydroxide is a strong base and when heated with a fat produces a soap made of lithium stearate lithium soap has the ability to thicken oils and it is used to manufacture all purpose high temperature lubricating greases metallurgy lithium e g as lithium carbonate is used as an additive to continuous casting mould flux slags where it increases fluidity a use which accounts for of global lithium use lithium compounds are also used as additives fluxes to foundry sand for iron casting to reduce veining lithium as lithium fluoride is used as an additive to aluminium smelters hall h roult process reducing melting temperature and increasing electrical resistance a use which accounts for of production when used as a flux for welding or soldering metallic lithium promotes the fusing of metals during the process and eliminates the forming of oxides by absorbing impurities alloys of the metal with aluminium cadmium copper and manganese are used to make high performance low density aircraft parts see also lithium aluminium alloys silicon nano welding lithium has been found effective in assisting the perfection of silicon nano welds in electronic components for electric batteries and other devices pyrotechnics lithium compounds are used as pyrotechnic colorants and oxidizers in red fireworks and flares air purification lithium chloride and lithium bromide are hygroscopic and are used as desiccants for gas streams lithium hydroxide and lithium peroxide are the salts most used in confined areas such as aboard spacecraft and submarines for carbon dioxide removal and air purification lithium hydroxide absorbs carbon dioxide from the air by forming lithium carbonate and is preferred over other alkaline hydroxides for its low weight lithium peroxide li o in presence of moisture not only reacts with carbon dioxide to form lithium carbonate but also releases oxygen the reaction is as follows li o co li co o some of the aforementioned compounds as well as lithium perchlorate are used in oxygen candles that supply submarines with oxygen these can also include small amounts of boron magnesium aluminum silicon titanium manganese and iron optics lithium fluoride artificially grown as crystal is clear and transparent and often used in specialist optics for ir uv and vuv vacuum uv applications it has one of the lowest refractive indexes and the furthest transmission range in the deep uv of most common materials finely divided lithium fluoride powder has been used for thermoluminescent radiation dosimetry tld when a sample of such is exposed to radiation it accumulates crystal defects which when heated resolve via a release of bluish light whose intensity is proportional to the absorbed dose thus allowing this to be quantified lithium fluoride is sometimes used in focal lenses of telescopes the high non linearity of lithium niobate also makes it useful in non linear optics applications it is used extensively in telecommunication products such as mobile phones and optical modulators for such components as resonant crystals lithium applications are used in more than of mobile phones organic and polymer chemistry organolithium compounds are widely used in the production of polymer and fine chemicals in the polymer industry which is the dominant consumer of these reagents alkyl lithium compounds are catalysts initiators in anionic polymerization of unfunctionalized olefins for the production of fine chemicals organolithium compounds function as strong bases and as reagents for the formation of carbon carbon bonds organolithium compounds are prepared from lithium metal and alkyl halides many other lithium compounds are used as reagents to prepare organic compounds some popular compounds include lithium aluminium hydride lialh lithium triethylborohydride n butyllithium and tert butyllithium military metallic lithium and its complex hydrides such as li alh are used as high energy additives to rocket propellants lithium aluminum hydride can also be used by itself as a solid fuel the mark torpedo stored chemical energy propulsion system sceps uses a small tank of sulfur hexafluoride which is sprayed over a block of solid lithium the reaction generates heat creating steam to propel the torpedo in a closed rankine cycle lithium hydride containing lithium is used in thermonuclear weapons where it serves as fuel for the fusion stage of the bomb nuclear lithium is valued as a source material for tritium production and as a neutron absorber in nuclear fusion natural lithium contains about lithium from which large amounts of lithium have been produced by isotope separation for use in nuclear weapons lithium gained interest for use in nuclear reactor coolants lithium deuteride was the fusion fuel of choice in early versions of the hydrogen bomb when bombarded by neutrons both li and li produce tritium this reaction which was not fully understood when hydrogen bombs were first tested was responsible for the runaway yield of the castle bravo nuclear test tritium fuses with deuterium in a fusion reaction that is relatively easy to achieve although details remain secret lithium deuteride apparently still plays a role in modern nuclear weapons as a fusion material lithium fluoride when highly enriched in the lithium isotope forms the basic constituent of the fluoride salt mixture lif bef used in liquid fluoride nuclear reactors lithium fluoride is exceptionally chemically stable and lif bef mixtures have low melting points in addition li be and f are among the few nuclides with low enough thermal neutron capture cross sections not to poison the fission reactions inside a nuclear fission reactor in conceptualized hypothetical nuclear fusion power plants lithium will be used to produce tritium in magnetically confined reactors using deuterium and tritium as the fuel naturally occurring tritium is extremely rare and must be synthetically produced by surrounding the reacting plasma with a blanket containing lithium where neutrons from the deuterium tritium reaction in the plasma will fission the lithium to produce more tritium li n he h lithium is also used as a source for alpha particles or helium nuclei when li is bombarded by accelerated protons be is formed which almost immediately undergoes fission to form two alpha particles this feat called splitting the atom at the time was the first fully man made nuclear reaction it was produced by cockroft and walton in in the us government accountability office said a shortage of lithium critical to the operation of out of american nuclear reactors places their ability to continue to provide electricity at some risk castle bravo first used lithium in the shrimp its first device which weighed only tons and generated massive nuclear atmospheric contamination of bikini atoll this perhaps accounts for the decline of us nuclear infrastructure the equipment needed to separate lithium from lithium is mostly a cold war leftover the us shut down most of this machinery in when it had a huge surplus of separated lithium mostly consumed during the twentieth century the report said it would take five years and million to million to reestablish the ability to separate lithium from lithium reactors that use lithium heat water under high pressure and transfer heat through heat exchangers that are prone to corrosion the reactors use lithium to counteract the corrosive effects of boric acid which is added to the water to absorb excess neutrons medicine lithium is useful in the treatment of bipolar disorder lithium salts may also be helpful for related diagnoses such as schizoaffective disorder and cyclic major depression the active part of these salts is the lithium ion li lithium may increase the risk of developing ebstein s cardiac anomaly in infants born to women who take lithium during the first trimester of pregnancy a review indicated that lithium therapy during treatment of bipolar disorder does not affect body weight precautions lithium metal is corrosive and requires special handling to avoid skin contact breathing lithium dust or lithium compounds which are often alkaline initially irritate the nose and throat while higher exposure can cause a buildup of fluid in the lungs leading to pulmonary edema the metal itself is a handling hazard because contact with moisture produces the caustic lithium hydroxide lithium is safely stored in non reactive compounds such as naphtha ,3
Beryllium,Be,beryllium is a chemical element with the symbol be and atomic number it is a steel gray strong lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal it is a divalent element that occurs naturally only in combination with other elements to form minerals notable gemstones high in beryllium include beryl aquamarine emerald and chrysoberyl it is a relatively rare element in the universe usually occurring as a product of the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays within the cores of stars beryllium is depleted as it is fused into heavier elements beryllium constitutes about percent by mass of earth s crust the world s annual beryllium production of tons is usually manufactured by extraction from the mineral beryl a difficult process because beryllium bonds strongly to oxygen in structural applications the combination of high flexural rigidity thermal stability thermal conductivity and low density times that of water make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components missiles spacecraft and satellites because of its low density and atomic mass beryllium is relatively transparent to x rays and other forms of ionizing radiation therefore it is the most common window material for x ray equipment and components of particle detectors when added as an alloying element to aluminium copper notably the alloy beryllium copper iron or nickel beryllium improves many physical properties for example tools and components made of beryllium copper alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface in air the surface of beryllium oxidizes readily at room temperature to form a passivation layer nm thick that protects it from further oxidation and corrosion the metal oxidizes in bulk beyond the passivation layer when heated above c f and burns brilliantly when heated to about c f the commercial use of beryllium requires the use of appropriate dust control equipment and industrial controls at all times because of the toxicity of inhaled beryllium containing dusts that can cause a chronic life threatening allergic disease in some people called berylliosis berylliosis causes pneumonia and other associated respiratory illness characteristics physical properties beryllium is a steel gray and hard metal that is brittle at room temperature and has a close packed hexagonal crystal structure it has exceptional stiffness young s modulus gpa and a melting point of c the modulus of elasticity of beryllium is approximately greater than that of steel the combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in beryllium about km s at ambient conditions other significant properties are high specific heat j kg k and thermal conductivity w m k which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight in combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear thermal expansion k these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading nuclear properties naturally occurring beryllium save for slight contamination by the cosmogenic radioisotopes is isotopically pure beryllium which has a nuclear spin of beryllium has a large scattering cross section for high energy neutrons about barns for energies above approximately kev therefore it works as a neutron reflector and neutron moderator effectively slowing the neutrons to the thermal energy range of below ev where the total cross section is at least an order of magnitude lower the exact value strongly depends on the purity and size of the crystallites in the material the single primordial beryllium isotope be also undergoes a n n neutron reaction with neutron energies over about mev to produce be which almost immediately breaks into two alpha particles thus for high energy neutrons beryllium is a neutron multiplier releasing more neutrons than it absorbs this nuclear reaction is be n he nneutrons are liberated when beryllium nuclei are struck by energetic alpha particles producing the nuclear reaction be he c nwhere he is an alpha particle and c is a carbon nucleus beryllium also releases neutrons under bombardment by gamma rays thus natural beryllium bombarded either by alphas or gammas from a suitable radioisotope is a key component of most radioisotope powered nuclear reaction neutron sources for the laboratory production of free neutrons small amounts of tritium are liberated when be nuclei absorb low energy neutrons in the three step nuclear reaction be n he he he li li n he hnote that he has a half life of only seconds is an electron and li has a high neutron absorption cross section tritium is a radioisotope of concern in nuclear reactor waste streams optical properties as a metal beryllium is transparent or translucent to most wavelengths of x rays and gamma rays making it useful for the output windows of x ray tubes and other such apparatus isotopes and nucleosynthesis both stable and unstable isotopes of beryllium are created in stars but the radioisotopes do not last long it is believed that most of the stable beryllium in the universe was originally created in the interstellar medium when cosmic rays induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope be and therefore beryllium is a monoisotopic and mononuclidic element radioactive cosmogenic be is produced in the atmosphere of the earth by the cosmic ray spallation of oxygen be accumulates at the soil surface where its relatively long half life million years permits a long residence time before decaying to boron thus be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion soil formation and the development of lateritic soils and as a proxy for measurement of the variations in solar activity and the age of ice cores the production of be is inversely proportional to solar activity because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach the earth nuclear explosions also form be by the reaction of fast neutrons with c in the carbon dioxide in air this is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites the isotope be half life days is also cosmogenic and shows an atmospheric abundance linked to sunspots much like be be has a very short half life of about s that contributes to its significant cosmological role as elements heavier than beryllium could not have been produced by nuclear fusion in the big bang this is due to the lack of sufficient time during the big bang s nucleosynthesis phase to produce carbon by the fusion of he nuclei and the very low concentrations of available beryllium british astronomer sir fred hoyle first showed that the energy levels of be and c allow carbon production by the so called triple alpha process in helium fueled stars where more nucleosynthesis time is available this process allows carbon to be produced in stars but not in the big bang star created carbon the basis of carbon based life is thus a component in the elements in the gas and dust ejected by agb stars and supernovae see also big bang nucleosynthesis as well as the creation of all other elements with atomic numbers larger than that of carbon the s electrons of beryllium may contribute to chemical bonding therefore when be decays by l electron capture it does so by taking electrons from its atomic orbitals that may be participating in bonding this makes its decay rate dependent to a measurable degree upon its chemical surroundings a rare occurrence in nuclear decay the shortest lived known isotope of beryllium is be which decays through neutron emission with a half life of s the exotic isotopes be and be are known to exhibit a nuclear halo this phenomenon can be understood as the nuclei of be and be have respectively and neutrons orbiting substantially outside the classical fermi waterdrop model of the nucleus occurrence the sun has a concentration of parts per billion ppb of beryllium beryllium has a concentration of to parts per million ppm in the earth s crust it is most concentrated in the soils ppm trace amounts of be are found in the earth s atmosphere the concentration of beryllium in sea water is parts per trillion in stream water however beryllium is more abundant with a concentration of ppb beryllium is found in over minerals but most are uncommon to rare the more common beryllium containing minerals include bertrandite be si o oh beryl al be si o chrysoberyl al beo and phenakite be sio precious forms of beryl are aquamarine red beryl and emerald the green color in gem quality forms of beryl comes from varying amounts of chromium about for emerald the two main ores of beryllium beryl and bertrandite are found in argentina brazil india madagascar russia and the united states total world reserves of beryllium ore are greater than tonnes production the extraction of beryllium from its compounds is a difficult process due to its high affinity for oxygen at elevated temperatures and its ability to reduce water when its oxide film is removed currently the united states china and kazakhstan are the only three countries involved in the industrial scale extraction of beryllium kazakhstan produces beryllium from a concentrate stockpiled before the breakup of the soviet union around this resource has become nearly depleted by mid s production of beryllium in russia was halted in and is planned to be resumed in the s beryllium is most commonly extracted from the mineral beryl which is either sintered using an extraction agent or melted into a soluble mixture the sintering process involves mixing beryl with sodium fluorosilicate and soda at c f to form sodium fluoroberyllate aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide beryllium hydroxide is precipitated from a solution of sodium fluoroberyllate and sodium hydroxide in water extraction of beryllium using the melt method involves grinding beryl into a powder and heating it to c f the melt is quickly cooled with water and then reheated to c to f in concentrated sulfuric acid mostly yielding beryllium sulfate and aluminium sulfate aqueous ammonia is then used to remove the aluminium and sulfur leaving beryllium hydroxide beryllium hydroxide created using either the sinter or melt method is then converted into beryllium fluoride or beryllium chloride to form the fluoride aqueous ammonium hydrogen fluoride is added to beryllium hydroxide to yield a precipitate of ammonium tetrafluoroberyllate which is heated to c f to form beryllium fluoride heating the fluoride to c f with magnesium forms finely divided beryllium and additional heating to c f creates the compact metal heating beryllium hydroxide forms the oxide which becomes beryllium chloride when combined with carbon and chlorine electrolysis of molten beryllium chloride is then used to obtain the metal chemical properties a beryllium atom has the electronic configuration he s the predominant oxidation state of beryllium is the beryllium atom has lost both of its valence electrons lower oxidation states have been found in for example bis carbene compounds beryllium s chemical behavior is largely a result of its small atomic and ionic radii it thus has very high ionization potentials and strong polarization while bonded to other atoms which is why all of its compounds are covalent its chemistry has similarities to that of aluminium an example of a diagonal relationship at room temperature the surface of beryllium forms a nm thick oxide passivation layer that prevents further reactions with air except for gradual thickening of the oxide up to about nm when heated above about c oxidation into the bulk metal progresses along grain boundaries once the metal is ignited in air by heating above

but not in nitric acid or water as this forms the oxide this behavior is similar to that of aluminium metal beryllium also dissolves in alkali solutions binary compounds of beryllium ii are polymeric

beryllium nitride be n is a high melting point compound which is readily hydrolyzed beryllium azide ben is known and beryllium phosphide be p has a similar structure to be n a number of beryllium borides are known such as be b be b be b beb beb and beb beryllium carbide be c is a refractory brick red compound that reacts with water to give methane no beryllium silicide has been identified the halides bex x f cl br i have a linear monomeric molecular structure in the gas phase complexes of the halides are formed with one or more ligands donating at total of two pairs of electrons such compounds obey the octet rule other coordinate complexes such as the aqua ion be h o also obey the octet rule aqueous solutions the aqueous solution chemistry of beryllium is the subject of a

be h o oh is less than of the beryllium concentration the most stable hydrolysis product is the trimeric ion be oh h o beryllium hydroxide be oh is insoluble in water at ph or more consequently beryllium compounds are generally insoluble at biological ph because of this inhalation of beryllium metal dust by people leads to the development of the fatal condition of berylliosis be oh dissolves

been reported the degree of formation is small because of competition with hydrolysis reactions organic chemistry organoberyllium chemistry is limited to academic research due to the cost and toxicity of beryllium beryllium derivatives and reagents required for the introduction of beryllium such as beryllium chloride organometallic beryllium compounds are known to be highly reactive examples of known organoberyllium compounds are dineopentylberyllium beryllocene cp be diallylberyllium by exchange reaction of diethyl beryllium with triallyl boron bis trimethylsilylallyl beryllium and be mes ligands can also be aryls and alkynyls history the mineral beryl which contains beryllium has been used at least since the ptolemaic dynasty of egypt in the first century ce roman naturalist pliny the elder mentioned in his encyclopedia natural history that beryl and emerald smaragdus were similar the papyrus graecus holmiensis written in the third or fourth century ce contains notes on how to prepare artificial emerald and beryl early analyses of emeralds and beryls by martin heinrich klaproth torbern olof bergman franz karl achard and johann jakob bindheim always yielded similar elements leading to the mistaken conclusion that both substances are aluminium silicates mineralogist ren just ha y discovered that both crystals are geometrically identical and he asked chemist louis nicolas vauquelin for a chemical analysis in a paper read before the institut de france vauquelin reported that he found a new earth by dissolving aluminium hydroxide from emerald and beryl in an additional alkali the editors of the journal annales de chimie et de physique named the new earth glucine for the sweet taste of some of its compounds klaproth preferred the name beryllina due to the fact that yttria also formed sweet salts the name beryllium was first used by w hler in friedrich w hler and antoine bussy independently isolated beryllium in by the chemical reaction of metallic potassium with beryllium chloride as follows becl k kcl beusing an alcohol lamp w hler heated alternating layers of beryllium chloride and potassium in a wired shut platinum crucible the above reaction immediately took place and caused the crucible to become white hot upon cooling and washing the resulting gray black powder he saw that it was made of fine particles with a dark metallic luster the highly reactive potassium had been produced by the electrolysis of its compounds a process discovered years before the chemical method using potassium yielded only small grains of beryllium from which no ingot of metal could be cast or hammered the direct electrolysis of a molten mixture of beryllium fluoride and sodium fluoride by paul lebeau in resulted in the first pure to samples of beryllium however industrial production started only after the first world war the original industrial involvement included subsidiaries and scientists related to the union carbide and carbon corporation in cleveland ohio and siemens halske ag in berlin in the us the process was ruled by hugh s cooper director of the kemet laboratories company in germany the first commercially successful process for producing beryllium was developed in by alfred stock and hans goldschmidt a sample of beryllium was bombarded with alpha rays from the decay of radium in a experiment by james chadwick that uncovered the existence of the neutron this same method is used in one class of radioisotope based laboratory neutron sources that produce neutrons for every million particles beryllium production saw a rapid increase during world war ii due to the rising demand for hard beryllium copper alloys and phosphors for fluorescent lights most early fluorescent lamps used zinc orthosilicate with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light small additions of magnesium tungstate improved the blue part of the spectrum to yield an acceptable white light halophosphate based phosphors replaced beryllium based phosphors after beryllium was found to be toxic electrolysis of a mixture of beryllium fluoride and sodium fluoride was used to isolate beryllium during the th century the metal s high melting point makes this process more energy consuming than corresponding processes used for the alkali metals early in the th century the production of beryllium by the thermal decomposition of beryllium iodide was investigated following the success of a similar process for the production of zirconium but this process proved to be uneconomical for volume production pure beryllium metal did not become readily available until even though it had been used as an alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier beryllium could be produced by reducing beryllium compounds such as beryllium chloride with metallic potassium or sodium currently most beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with magnesium the price on the american market for vacuum cast beryllium ingots was about per pound per kilogram in between and the world s production of beryllium had decreased from to about tonnes it then increased to tonnes by of which tonnes came from the united states etymology named after beryl a semiprecious mineral from which it was first isolated applications radiation windows because of its low atomic number and very low absorption for x rays the oldest and still one of the most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for x ray tubes extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the x ray images thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for x ray detectors and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity low energy x rays typical of synchrotron radiation vacuum tight windows and beam tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium in scientific setups for various x ray emission studies e g energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted x rays have much lower energies ev than x rays from most studied materials low atomic number also makes beryllium relatively transparent to energetic particles therefore it is used to build the beam pipe around the collision region in particle physics setups such as all four main detector experiments at the large hadron collider alice atlas cms lhcb the tevatron and at slac the low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above absolute zero and its diamagnetic nature keeps it from interfering with the complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and focus the particle beams mechanical applications because of its stiffness light weight and dimensional stability over a wide temperature range beryllium metal is used for lightweight structural components in the defense and aerospace industries in high speed aircraft guided missiles spacecraft and satellites including the james webb space telescope several liquid fuel rockets have used rocket nozzles made of pure beryllium beryllium powder was itself studied as a rocket fuel but this use has never materialized a small number of extreme high end bicycle frames have been built with beryllium from to the mclaren formula one team used mercedes benz engines with beryllium aluminium alloy pistons the use of beryllium engine components was banned following a protest by scuderia ferrari mixing about beryllium into copper forms an alloy called beryllium copper that is six times stronger than copper alone beryllium alloys are used in many applications because of their combination of elasticity high electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity high strength and hardness nonmagnetic properties as well as good corrosion and fatigue resistance these applications include non sparking tools that are used near flammable gases beryllium nickel in springs and membranes beryllium nickel and beryllium iron used in surgical instruments and high temperature devices as little as parts per million of beryllium alloyed with liquid magnesium leads to a significant increase in oxidation resistance and decrease in flammability the high elastic stiffness of beryllium has led to its extensive use in precision instrumentation e g in inertial guidance systems and in the support mechanisms for optical systems beryllium copper alloys were also applied as a hardening agent in jason pistols which were used to strip the paint from the hulls of ships beryllium was also used for cantilevers in high performance phonograph cartridge styli where its extreme stiffness and low density allowed for tracking weights to be reduced to gram yet still track high frequency passages with minimal distortion an earlier major application of beryllium was in brakes for military airplanes because of its hardness high melting point and exceptional ability to dissipate heat environmental considerations have led to substitution by other materials to reduce costs beryllium can be alloyed with significant amounts of aluminium resulting in the albemet alloy a trade name this blend is cheaper than pure beryllium while still retaining many desirable properties mirrors beryllium mirrors are of particular interest large area mirrors frequently with a honeycomb support structure are used for example in meteorological satellites where low weight and long term dimensional stability are critical smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire control systems e g in the german made leopard and leopard main battle tanks in these systems very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium in some applications though the beryllium blank is polished without any coating this is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle the james webb space telescope has hexagonal beryllium sections for its mirrors each plated with a thin layer of gold because jwst will face a temperature of k the mirror is made of gold plated beryllium capable of handling extreme cold better than glass beryllium contracts and deforms less than glass and remains more uniform in such temperatures for the same reason the optics of the spitzer space telescope are entirely built of beryllium metal magnetic applications beryllium is non magnetic therefore tools fabricated out of beryllium based materials are used by naval or military explosive ordnance disposal teams for work on or near naval mines since these mines commonly have magnetic fuzes they are also found in maintenance and construction materials near magnetic resonance imaging mri machines because of the high magnetic fields generated in the fields of radio communications and powerful usually military radars hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic klystrons magnetrons traveling wave tubes etc that are used for generating high levels of microwave power in the transmitters nuclear applications thin plates or foils of beryllium are sometimes used in nuclear weapon designs as the very outer layer of the plutonium pits in the primary stages of thermonuclear bombs placed to surround the fissile material these layers of beryllium are good pushers for the implosion of the plutonium and they are good neutron reflectors just as in beryllium moderated nuclear reactors beryllium is also commonly used in some neutron sources in laboratory devices in which relatively few neutrons are needed rather than having to use a nuclear reactor or a particle accelerator powered neutron generator for this purpose a target of beryllium is bombarded with energetic alpha particles from a radioisotope such as polonium radium plutonium or americium in the nuclear reaction that occurs a beryllium nucleus is transmuted into carbon and one free neutron is emitted traveling in about the same direction as the alpha particle was heading such alpha decay driven beryllium neutron sources named urchin neutron initiators were used in some early atomic bombs neutron sources in which beryllium is bombarded with gamma rays from a gamma decay radioisotope are also used to produce laboratory neutrons beryllium is also used in fuel fabrication for candu reactors the fuel elements have small appendages that are resistance brazed to the fuel cladding using an induction brazing process with be as the braze filler material bearing pads are brazed in place to prevent contact between the fuel bundle and the pressure tube containing it and inter element spacer pads are brazed on to prevent element to element contact beryllium is also used at the joint european torus nuclear fusion research laboratory and it will be used in the more advanced iter to condition the components which face the plasma beryllium has also been proposed as a cladding material for nuclear fuel rods because of its good combination of mechanical chemical and nuclear properties beryllium fluoride is one of the constituent salts of the eutectic salt mixture flibe which is used as a solvent moderator and coolant in many hypothetical molten salt reactor designs including the liquid fluoride thorium reactor lftr acoustics the low weight and high rigidity of beryllium make it useful as a material for high frequency speaker drivers because beryllium is expensive many times more than titanium hard to shape due to its brittleness and toxic if mishandled beryllium tweeters are limited to high end home pro audio and public address applications some high fidelity products have been fraudulently claimed to be made of the material some high end phonograph cartridges used beryllium cantilevers to improve tracking by reducing mass electronic beryllium is a p type dopant in iii v compound semiconductors it is widely used in materials such as gaas algaas ingaas and inalas grown by molecular beam epitaxy mbe cross rolled beryllium sheet is an excellent structural support for printed circuit boards in surface mount technology in critical electronic applications beryllium is both a structural support and heat sink the application also requires a coefficient of thermal expansion that is well matched to the alumina and polyimide glass substrates the beryllium beryllium oxide composite e materials have been specially designed for these electronic applications and have the additional advantage that the thermal expansion coefficient can be tailored to match diverse substrate materials beryllium oxide is useful for many applications that require the combined properties of an electrical insulator and an excellent heat conductor with high strength and hardness and a very high melting point beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in high power transistors in radio frequency transmitters for telecommunications beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets beryllium compounds were used in fluorescent lighting tubes but this use was discontinued because of the disease berylliosis which developed in the workers who were making the tubes healthcare beryllium is a component of several dental alloys toxicity and safety biological effects approximately micrograms of beryllium is found in the average human body an amount not considered harmful beryllium is chemically similar to magnesium and therefore can displace it from enzymes which causes them to malfunction because be is a highly charged and small ion it can easily get into many tissues and cells where it specifically targets cell nuclei inhibiting many enzymes including those used for synthesizing dna its toxicity is exacerbated by the fact that the body has no means to control beryllium levels and once inside the body the beryllium cannot be removed inhalation chronic berylliosis is a pulmonary and systemic granulomatous disease caused by inhalation of dust or fumes contaminated with beryllium either large amounts over a short time or small amounts over a long time can lead to this ailment symptoms of the disease can take up to five years to develop about a third of patients with it die and the survivors are left disabled the international agency for research on cancer iarc lists beryllium and beryllium compounds as category carcinogens occupational exposure in the us the occupational safety and health administration osha has designated a permissible exposure limit pel for beryllium and beryllium compounds of g m as an hour time weighted average twa and g m as a short term exposure limit over a sampling period of minutes the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit rel upper bound threshold of g m the idlh immediately dangerous to life and health value is mg m the toxicity of beryllium is on par with other toxic metalloids metals such as arsenic and mercury exposure to beryllium in the workplace can lead to a sensitization immune response and can over time develop chronic beryllium disease cbd the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh in the united states researches these effects in collaboration with a major manufacturer of beryllium products niosh also conducts genetic research on sensitization and cbd independently of this collaboration acute beryllium disease in the form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in europe in and in the united states in a survey found that about of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in in the united states had beryllium related lung diseases chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects and the differential diagnosis is often difficult it killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design such as herbert l anderson beryllium may be found in coal slag when the slag is formulated into an abrasive agent for blasting paint and rust from hard surfaces the beryllium can become airborne and become a source of exposure although the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium containing alloys the manufacturing of electronic devices and the handling of other beryllium containing material detection early researchers undertook the highly hazardous practice of identifying beryllium and its various compounds from its sweet taste identification is now performed using safe modern diagnostics techniques a successful test for beryllium in air and on surfaces has been developed and published as an international voluntary consensus standard astm d the procedure uses dilute ammonium bifluoride for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline allowing up to times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration the new procedure has been successfully tested on a variety of surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium in minute concentrations astm d the niosh manual of analytical methods contains methods for measuring occupational exposures to beryllium ,4
Boron,B,boron is a chemical element with the symbol b and atomic number in its crystalline form it is a brittle dark lustrous metalloid in its amorphous form it is a brown powder as the lightest element of the boron group it has three valence electrons for forming covalent bonds resulting in many compounds such as boric acid the mineral sodium borate and the ultra hard crystals of boron carbide and boron nitride boron is synthesized entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis so it is a low abundance element in the solar system and in the earth s crust it constitutes about percent by weight of earth s crust it is concentrated on earth by the water solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds the borate minerals these are mined industrially as evaporites such as borax and kernite the largest known deposits are in turkey the largest producer of boron minerals elemental boron is a metalloid that is found in small amounts in meteoroids but chemically uncombined boron is not otherwise found naturally on earth industrially the very pure element is produced with difficulty because of contamination by carbon or other elements that resist removal several allotropes exist amorphous boron is a brown powder crystalline boron is silvery to black extremely hard about on the mohs scale and a poor electrical conductor at room temperature the primary use of the element itself is as boron filaments with applications similar to carbon fibers in some high strength materials boron is primarily used in chemical compounds about half of all production consumed globally is an additive in fiberglass for insulation and structural materials the next leading use is in polymers and ceramics in high strength lightweight structural and heat resistant materials borosilicate glass is desired for its greater strength and thermal shock resistance than ordinary soda lime glass as sodium perborate it is used as a bleach a small amount is used as a dopant in semiconductors and reagent intermediates in the synthesis of organic fine chemicals a few boron containing organic pharmaceuticals are used or are in study natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes one of which boron has a number of uses as a neutron capturing agent the intersection of boron with biology is very small consensus on it as essential for mammalian life is lacking borates have low toxicity in mammals similar to table salt but are more toxic to arthropods and are occasionally used as insecticides boron containing organic antibiotics are known although only traces are required it is an essential plant nutrient history the word boron was coined from borax the mineral from which it was isolated by analogy with carbon which boron resembles chemically borax in its mineral form then known as tincal first saw use as a glaze beginning in china circa ad some crude borax traveled westward and was apparently mentioned by the alchemist jabir ibn hayyan around ad marco polo brought some glazes back to italy in the th century georgius agricola in around ad reported the use of borax as a flux in metallurgy in boric acid was recognized in the hot springs soffioni near florence italy at which point it became known as sal sedativum with ostensible medical benefits the mineral was named sassolite after sasso pisano in italy sasso was the main source of european borax from to when american sources replaced it boron compounds were relatively rarely used until the late s when francis marion smith s pacific coast borax company first popularized and produced them in volume at low cost boron was not recognized as an element until it was isolated by sir humphry davy and by joseph louis gay lussac and louis jacques th nard in davy observed that electric current sent through a solution of borates produced a brown precipitate on one of the electrodes in his subsequent experiments he used potassium to reduce boric acid instead of electrolysis he produced enough boron to confirm a new element and named it boracium gay lussac and th nard used iron to reduce boric acid at high temperatures by oxidizing boron with air they showed that boric acid is its oxidation product j ns jacob berzelius identified it as an element in pure boron was arguably first produced by the american chemist ezekiel weintraub in preparation of elemental boron in the laboratory the earliest routes to elemental boron involved the reduction of boric oxide with metals such as magnesium or aluminium however the product is almost always contaminated with borides of those metals pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with hydrogen at high temperatures ultrapure boron for use in the semiconductor industry is produced by the decomposition of diborane at high temperatures and then further purified by the zone melting or czochralski processes the production of boron compounds does not involve the formation of elemental boron but exploits the convenient availability of borates characteristics allotropes boron is similar to carbon in its capability to form stable covalently bonded molecular networks even nominally disordered amorphous boron contains regular boron icosahedra which are bonded randomly to each other without long range order crystalline boron is a very hard black material with a melting point of above c it forms four major allotropes rhombohedral and rhombohedral r and r orthorhombic and tetragonal t all four phases are stable at ambient conditions and rhombohedral is the most common and stable an tetragonal phase also exists t but is very difficult to produce without significant contamination most of the phases are based on b icosahedra but the phase can be described as a rocksalt type arrangement of the icosahedra and b atomic pairs it can be produced by compressing other boron phases to gpa and heating to c it remains stable after releasing the temperature and pressure the t phase is produced at similar pressures but higher temperatures of c the t and t phases might coexist at ambient conditions with the t phase being the more stable compressing boron above gpa produces a boron phase with an as yet unknown structure and this phase is a superconductor at temperatures below k borospherene fullerene like b molecules and borophene proposed graphene like structure were described in chemistry of the element elemental boron is rare and poorly studied because the pure material is extremely difficult to prepare most studies of boron involve samples that contain small amounts of carbon the chemical behavior of boron resembles that of silicon more than aluminium crystalline boron is chemically inert and resistant to attack by boiling hydrofluoric or hydrochloric acid when finely divided it is attacked slowly by hot concentrated hydrogen peroxide hot concentrated nitric acid hot sulfuric acid or hot mixture of sulfuric and chromic acids the rate of oxidation of boron depends on the crystallinity particle size purity and temperature boron does not react with air at room temperature but at higher temperatures it burns to form boron trioxide b o b o boron undergoes halogenation to give trihalides for example b br bbr the trichloride in practice is usually made from the oxide atomic structure boron is the lightest element having an electron in a p orbital in its ground state but unlike most other p elements it rarely obeys the octet rule and usually places only six electrons in three molecular orbitals onto its valence shell boron is the prototype for the boron group the iupac group although the other members of this group are metals and more typical p elements only aluminium to some extent shares boron s aversion to the octet rule chemical compounds in the most familiar compounds boron has the formal oxidation state iii these include oxides sulfides nitrides and halides the trihalides adopt a planar trigonal structure these compounds are lewis acids in that they readily form adducts with electron pair donors which are called lewis bases for example fluoride f and boron trifluoride bf combined to give the tetrafluoroborate anion bf boron trifluoride is used in the petrochemical industry as a catalyst the halides react with water to form boric acid it is found in nature on earth almost entirely as various oxides of b iii often associated with other elements more than one hundred borate minerals contain boron in oxidation state these minerals resemble silicates in some respect although it is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen but also in a trigonal planar configuration unlike silicates boron minerals never contain it with coordination number greater than four a typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax shown at left the formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate center is balanced by metal cations in the minerals such as the sodium na in borax the tourmaline group of borate silicates is also a very important boron bearing mineral group and a number of borosilicates are also known to exist naturally boranes are chemical compounds of boron and hydrogen with the generic formula of bxhy these compounds do not occur in nature many of the boranes readily oxidise on contact with air some violently the parent member bh is called borane but it is known only in the gaseous state and dimerises to form diborane b h the larger boranes all consist of boron clusters that are polyhedral some of which exist as isomers for example isomers of b h are based on the fusion of two atom clusters the most important boranes are diborane b h and two of its pyrolysis products pentaborane b h and decaborane b h a large number of anionic boron hydrides are known e g b h the formal oxidation number in boranes is positive and is based on the assumption that hydrogen is counted as as in active metal hydrides the mean oxidation number for the borons is then simply the ratio of hydrogen to boron in the molecule for example in diborane b h the boron oxidation state is but in decaborane b h it is or in these compounds the oxidation state of boron is often not a whole number the boron nitrides are notable for the variety of structures that they adopt they exhibit structures analogous to various allotropes of carbon including graphite diamond and nanotubes in the diamond like structure called cubic boron nitride tradename borazon boron atoms exist in the tetrahedral structure of carbon atoms in diamond but one in every four b n bonds can be viewed as a coordinate covalent bond wherein two electrons are donated by the nitrogen atom which acts as the lewis base to a bond to the lewis acidic boron iii centre cubic boron nitride among other applications is used as an abrasive as it has a hardness comparable with diamond the two substances are able to produce scratches on each other in the bn compound analogue of graphite hexagonal boron nitride h bn the positively charged boron and negatively charged nitrogen atoms in each plane lie adjacent to the oppositely charged atom in the next plane consequently graphite and h bn have very different properties although both are lubricants as these planes slip past each other easily however h bn is a relatively poor electrical and thermal conductor in the planar directions organoboron chemistry a large number of organoboron compounds are known and many are useful in organic synthesis many are produced from hydroboration which employs diborane b h a simple borane chemical organoboron iii compounds are usually tetrahedral or trigonal planar for example tetraphenylborate b c h vs triphenylborane b c h however multiple boron atoms reacting with each other have a tendency to form novel dodecahedral sided and icosahedral sided structures composed completely of boron atoms or with varying numbers of carbon heteroatoms organoboron chemicals have been employed in uses as diverse as boron carbide see below a complex very hard ceramic composed of boron carbon cluster anions and cations to carboranes carbon boron cluster chemistry compounds that can be halogenated to form reactive structures including carborane acid a superacid as one example carboranes form useful molecular moieties that add considerable amounts of boron to other biochemicals in order to synthesize boron containing compounds for boron neutron capture therapy for cancer compounds of b i and b ii as anticipated by its hydride clusters boron forms a variety of stable compounds with formal oxidation state less than three b f and b cl are well characterized binary metal boron compounds the metal borides contain boron in negative oxidation states illustrative is magnesium diboride mgb each boron atom has a formal charge and magnesium is assigned a formal charge of in this material the boron centers are trigonal planar with an extra double bond for each boron forming sheets akin to the carbon in graphite however unlike hexagonal boron nitride which lacks electrons in the plane of the covalent atoms the delocalized electrons in magnesium diboride allow it to conduct electricity similar to isoelectronic graphite in this material was found to be a high temperature superconductor it is a superconductor under active development a project at cern to make mgb cables has resulted in superconducting test cables able to carry amperes for extremely high current distribution applications such as the contemplated high luminosity version of the large hadron collider certain other metal borides find specialized applications as hard materials for cutting tools often the boron in borides has fractional oxidation states such as in calcium hexaboride cab from the structural perspective the most distinctive chemical compounds of boron are the hydrides included in this series are the cluster compounds dodecaborate b h decaborane b h and the carboranes such as c b h characteristically such compounds contain boron with coordination numbers greater than four isotopes boron has two naturally occurring and stable isotopes b and b the mass difference results in a wide range of b values which are defined as a fractional difference between the b and b and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand in natural waters ranging from to there are known isotopes of boron the shortest lived isotope is b which decays through proton emission and alpha decay with a half life of s isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species b oh and b oh boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization during h o phase changes in hydrothermal systems and during hydrothermal alteration of rock the latter effect results in preferential removal of the b oh ion onto clays it results in solutions enriched in b oh and therefore may be responsible for the large b enrichment in seawater relative to both oceanic crust and continental crust this difference may act as an isotopic signature the exotic b exhibits a nuclear halo i e its radius is appreciably larger than that predicted by the liquid drop model the b isotope is useful for capturing thermal neutrons see neutron cross section typical cross sections the nuclear industry enriches natural boron to nearly pure b the less valuable by product depleted boron is nearly pure b commercial isotope enrichment because of its high neutron cross section boron is often used to control fission in nuclear reactors as a neutron capturing substance several industrial scale enrichment processes have been developed however only the fractionated vacuum distillation of the dimethyl ether adduct of boron trifluoride dme bf and column chromatography of borates are being used enriched boron boron enriched boron or b is used in both radiation shielding and is the primary nuclide used in neutron capture therapy of cancer in the latter boron neutron capture therapy or bnct a compound containing b is incorporated into a pharmaceutical which is selectively taken up by a malignant tumor and tissues near it the patient is then treated with a beam of low energy neutrons at a relatively low neutron radiation dose the neutrons however trigger energetic and short range secondary alpha particle and lithium heavy ion radiation that are products of the boron neutron nuclear reaction and this ion radiation additionally bombards the tumor especially from inside the tumor cells in nuclear reactors b is used for reactivity control and in emergency shutdown systems it can serve either function in the form of borosilicate control rods or as boric acid in pressurized water reactors b boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling it is then slowly filtered out over many months as fissile material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive in future crewed interplanetary spacecraft b has a theoretical role as structural material as boron fibers or bn nanotube material which would also serve a special role in the radiation shield one of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays which are mostly high energy protons is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene but the moderated neutrons continue to be a radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons li and b appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection depleted boron boron radiation hardened semiconductors cosmic radiation will produce secondary neutrons if it hits spacecraft structures those neutrons will be captured in b if it is present in the spacecraft s semiconductors producing a gamma ray an alpha particle and a lithium ion those resultant decay products may then irradiate nearby semiconductor chip structures causing data loss bit flipping or single event upset in radiation hardened semiconductor designs one countermeasure is to use depleted boron which is greatly enriched in b and contains almost no b this is useful because b is largely immune to radiation damage depleted boron is a byproduct of the nuclear industry see above proton boron fusion b is also a candidate as a fuel for aneutronic fusion when struck by a proton with energy of about kev it produces three alpha particles and mev of energy most other fusion reactions involving hydrogen and helium produce penetrating neutron radiation which weakens reactor structures and induces long term radioactivity thereby endangering operating personnel however the alpha particles from b fusion can be turned directly into electric power and all radiation stops as soon as the reactor is turned off nmr spectroscopy both b and b possess nuclear spin the nuclear spin of b is and that of b is these isotopes are therefore of use in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and spectrometers specially adapted to detecting the boron nuclei are available commercially the b and b nuclei also cause splitting in the resonances of attached nuclei occurrence boron is rare in the universe and solar system due to trace formation in the big bang and in stars it is formed in minor amounts in cosmic ray spallation nucleosynthesis and may be found uncombined in cosmic dust and meteoroid materials in the high oxygen environment of earth boron is always found fully oxidized to borate boron does not appear on earth in elemental form extremely small traces of elemental boron were detected in lunar regolith although boron is a relatively rare element in the earth s crust representing only of the crust mass it can be highly concentrated by the action of water in which many borates are soluble it is found naturally combined in compounds such as borax and boric acid sometimes found in volcanic spring waters about a hundred borate minerals are known on september scientists reported that the curiosity rover detected boron an essential ingredient for life on earth on the planet mars such a finding along with previous discoveries that water may have been present on ancient mars further supports the possible early habitability of gale crater on mars production economically important sources of boron are the minerals colemanite rasorite kernite ulexite and tincal together these constitute of mined boron containing ore the largest global borax deposits known many still untapped are in central and western turkey including the provinces of eski ehir k tahya and bal kesir global proven boron mineral mining reserves exceed one billion metric tonnes against a yearly production of about four million tonnes turkey and the united states are the largest producers of boron products turkey produces about half of the global yearly demand through eti mine works turkish eti maden letmeleri a turkish state owned mining and chemicals company focusing on boron products it holds a government monopoly on the mining of borate minerals in turkey which possesses of the world s known deposits in it held a share of production of global borate minerals ahead of its main competitor rio tinto group almost a quarter of global boron production comes from the single rio tinto borax mine also known as the u s borax boron mine n w near boron california market trend the average cost of crystalline elemental boron is us g elemental boron is chiefly used in making boron fibers where it is deposited by chemical vapor deposition on a tungsten core see below boron fibers are used in lightweight composite applications such as high strength tapes this use is a very small fraction of total boron use boron is introduced into semiconductors as boron compounds by ion implantation estimated global consumption of boron almost entirely as boron compounds was about million tonnes of b o in as compounds such as borax and kernite its cost was us tonne in boron mining and refining capacities are considered to be adequate to meet expected levels of growth through the next decade the form in which boron is consumed has changed in recent years the use of ores like colemanite has declined following concerns over arsenic content consumers have moved toward the use of refined borates and boric acid that have a lower pollutant content increasing demand for boric acid has led a number of producers to invest in additional capacity turkey s state owned eti mine works opened a new boric acid plant with the production capacity of tonnes per year at emet in rio tinto group increased the capacity of its boron plant from tonnes per year in to tonnes per year by may with plans to grow this to tonnes per year in chinese boron producers have been unable to meet rapidly growing demand for high quality borates this has led to imports of sodium tetraborate borax growing by a hundredfold between and and boric acid imports increasing by per year over the same period the rise in global demand has been driven by high growth rates in glass fiber fiberglass and borosilicate glassware production a rapid increase in the manufacture of reinforcement grade boron containing fiberglass in asia has offset the development of boron free reinforcement grade fiberglass in europe and the us the recent rises in energy prices may lead to greater use of insulation grade fiberglass with consequent growth in the boron consumption roskill consulting group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by per year to reach million tonnes by the highest growth in demand is expected to be in asia where demand could rise by an average per year applications nearly all boron ore extracted from the earth is destined for refinement into boric acid and sodium tetraborate pentahydrate in the united states of the boron is used for the production of glass and ceramics the major global industrial scale use of boron compounds about of end use is in production of glass fiber for boron containing insulating and structural fiberglasses especially in asia boron is added to the glass as borax pentahydrate or boron oxide to influence the strength or fluxing qualities of the glass fibers another of global boron production is for borosilicate glass as used in high strength glassware about of global boron is used in boron ceramics including super hard materials discussed below agriculture consumes of global boron production and bleaches and detergents about elemental boron fiber boron fibers boron filaments are high strength lightweight materials that are used chiefly for advanced aerospace structures as a component of composite materials as well as limited production consumer and sporting goods such as golf clubs and fishing rods the fibers can be produced by chemical vapor deposition of boron on a tungsten filament boron fibers and sub millimeter sized crystalline boron springs are produced by laser assisted chemical vapor deposition translation of the focused laser beam allows production of even complex helical structures such structures show good mechanical properties elastic modulus gpa fracture strain fracture stress gpa and can be applied as reinforcement of ceramics or in micromechanical systems boronated fiberglass fiberglass is a fiber reinforced polymer made of plastic reinforced by glass fibers commonly woven into a mat the glass fibers used in the material are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use these glasses all contain silica or silicate with varying amounts of oxides of calcium magnesium and sometimes boron the boron is present as borosilicate borax or boron oxide and is added to increase the strength of the glass or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of silica which is too high to be easily worked in its pure form to make glass fibers the highly boronated glasses used in fiberglass are e glass named for electrical use but now the most common fiberglass for general use e glass is alumino borosilicate glass with less than w w alkali oxides mainly used for glass reinforced plastics other common high boron glasses include c glass an alkali lime glass with high boron oxide content used for glass staple fibers and insulation and d glass a borosilicate glass named for its low dielectric constant not all fiberglasses contain boron but on a global scale most of the fiberglass used does contain it because the ubiquitous use of fiberglass in construction and insulation boron containing fiberglasses consume half the global production of boron and are the single largest commercial boron market borosilicate glass borosilicate glass which is typically b o sio and al o has a low coefficient of thermal expansion giving it a good resistance to thermal shock schott ag s duran and owens corning s trademarked pyrex are two major brand names for this glass used both in laboratory glassware and in consumer cookware and bakeware chiefly for this resistance boron carbide ceramic several boron compounds are known for their extreme hardness and toughness boron carbide is a ceramic material which is obtained by decomposing b o with carbon in an electric furnace b o c b c coboron carbide s structure is only approximately b c and it shows a clear depletion of carbon from this suggested stoichiometric ratio this is due to its very complex structure the substance can be seen with empirical formula b c i e with b dodecahedra being a motif but with less carbon as the suggested c units are replaced with c b c chains and some smaller b octahedra are present as well see the boron carbide article for structural analysis the repeating polymer plus semi crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great structural strength per weight it is used in tank armor bulletproof vests and numerous other structural applications boron carbide s ability to absorb neutrons without forming long lived radionuclides especially when doped with extra boron makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding control rods and shut down pellets within control rods boron carbide is often powdered to increase its surface area high hardness and abrasive compounds boron carbide and cubic boron nitride powders are widely used as abrasives boron nitride is a material isoelectronic to carbon similar to carbon it has both hexagonal soft graphite like h bn and cubic hard diamond like c bn forms h bn is used as a high temperature component and lubricant c bn also known under commercial name borazon is a superior abrasive its hardness is only slightly smaller than but its chemical stability is superior to that of diamond heterodiamond also called bcn is another diamond like boron compound metallurgy boron is added to boron steels at the level of a few parts per million to increase hardenability higher percentages are added to steels used in the nuclear industry due to boron s neutron absorption ability boron can also increase the surface hardness of steels and alloys through boriding additionally metal borides are used for coating tools through chemical vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition implantation of boron ions into metals and alloys through ion implantation or ion beam deposition results in a spectacular increase in surface resistance and microhardness laser alloying has also been successfully used for the same purpose these borides are an alternative to diamond coated tools and their treated surfaces have similar properties to those of the bulk boride for example rhenium diboride can be produced at ambient pressures but is rather expensive because of rhenium the hardness of reb exhibits considerable anisotropy because of its hexagonal layered structure its value is comparable to that of tungsten carbide silicon carbide titanium diboride or zirconium diboride similarly almgb tib composites possess high hardness and wear resistance and are used in either bulk form or as coatings for components exposed to high temperatures and wear loads detergent formulations and bleaching agents borax is used in various household laundry and cleaning products including the mule team borax laundry booster and boraxo powdered hand soap it is also present in some tooth bleaching formulas sodium perborate serves as a source of active oxygen in many detergents laundry detergents cleaning products and laundry bleaches however despite its name borateem laundry bleach no longer contains any boron compounds using sodium percarbonate instead as a bleaching agent insecticides boric acid is used as an insecticide notably against ants fleas and cockroaches semiconductors boron is a useful dopant for such semiconductors as silicon germanium and silicon carbide having one fewer valence electron than the host atom it donates a hole resulting in p type conductivity traditional method of introducing boron into semiconductors is via its atomic diffusion at high temperatures this process uses either solid b o liquid bbr or gaseous boron sources b h or bf however after the s it was mostly replaced by ion implantation which relies mostly on bf as a boron source boron trichloride gas is also an important chemical in semiconductor industry however not for doping but rather for plasma etching of metals and their oxides triethylborane is also injected into vapor deposition reactors as a boron source examples are the plasma deposition of boron containing hard carbon films silicon nitride boron nitride films and for doping of diamond film with boron magnets boron is a component of neodymium magnets nd fe b which are among the strongest type of permanent magnet these magnets are found in a variety of electromechanical and electronic devices such as magnetic resonance imaging mri medical imaging systems in compact and relatively small motors and actuators as examples computer hdds hard disk drives cd compact disk and dvd digital versatile disk players rely on neodymium magnet motors to deliver intense rotary power in a remarkably compact package in mobile phones neo magnets provide the magnetic field which allows tiny speakers to deliver appreciable audio power shielding and neutron absorber in nuclear reactors boron shielding is used as a control for nuclear reactors taking advantage of its high cross section for neutron capture in pressurized water reactors a variable concentration of boronic acid in the cooling water is used as a neutron poison to compensate the variable reactivity of the fuel when new rods are inserted the concentration of boronic acid is maximal and is reduced during the lifetime other nonmedical uses because of its distinctive green flame amorphous boron is used in pyrotechnic flares starch and casein based adhesives contain sodium tetraborate decahydrate na b o h o some anti corrosion systems contain borax sodium borates are used as a flux for soldering silver and gold and with ammonium chloride for welding ferrous metals they are also fire retarding additives to plastics and rubber articles boric acid also known as orthoboric acid h bo is used in the production of textile fiberglass and flat panel displays and in many pvac and pvoh based adhesives triethylborane is a substance which ignites the jp fuel of the pratt whitney j turbojet ramjet engines powering the lockheed sr blackbird it was also used to ignite the f engines on the saturn v rocket utilized by nasa s apollo and skylab programs from until today spacex uses it to ignite the engines on their falcon rocket triethylborane is suitable for this because of its pyrophoric properties especially the fact that it burns with a very high temperature triethylborane is an industrial initiator in radical reactions where it is effective even at low temperatures borates are used as environmentally benign wood preservatives pharmaceutical and biological applications boric acid has antiseptic antifungal and antiviral properties and for these reasons is applied as a water clarifier in swimming pool water treatment mild solutions of boric acid have been used as eye antiseptics bortezomib marketed as velcade and cytomib boron appears as an active element in the organic pharmaceutical bortezomib a new class of drug called the proteasome inhibitor for the treatment of myeloma and one form of lymphoma it is in currently in experimental trials against other types of lymphoma the boron atom in bortezomib binds the catalytic site of the s proteasome with high affinity and specificity a number of potential boronated pharmaceuticals using boron have been prepared for use in boron neutron capture therapy bnct some boron compounds show promise in treating arthritis though none have as yet been generally approved for the purpose tavaborole marketed as kerydin is an aminoacyl trna synthetase inhibitor which is used to treat toenail

areas magnesium diboride is an important superconducting material with the transition temperature of k mgb wires are produced with the powder in tube process and applied in superconducting magnets amorphous boron is used as a melting point depressant in nickel chromium braze alloys hexagonal boron nitride forms atomically thin layers which have been used to enhance the electron mobility in graphene devices it also forms nanotubular structures bnnts which have high strength high chemical stability and high thermal conductivity among its list of desirable properties biological role boron is an essential plant nutrient required primarily for maintaining the integrity of cell walls however high soil concentrations of greater than ppm lead to marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth performance levels as low as ppm produce these same symptoms in plants that are particularly sensitive to boron in the soil nearly all plants even those somewhat tolerant of soil boron will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when soil boron content is greater than ppm when this content exceeds ppm few plants will perform well and some may not survive it is thought that boron plays several essential roles in animals including humans but the exact physiological role is poorly understood a small human trial published in reported on postmenopausal women first made boron deficient and then repleted with mg day boron supplementation markedly reduced urinary calcium excretion and elevated the serum concentrations of beta estradiol and testosterone the u s institute of medicine has not confirmed that boron is an essential nutrient for humans so neither a recommended dietary allowance rda nor an adequate intake have been established adult dietary intake is estimated at to mg day with about absorbed what is absorbed is mostly excreted in urine the tolerable upper intake level for adults is mg day in a hypothesis suggested it was possible that boron and molybdenum catalyzed the production of rna on mars with life being transported to earth via a meteorite around billion years ago there exist several known boron containing natural antibiotics the first one found was boromycin isolated from streptomyces congenital endothelial dystrophy type a rare form of corneal dystrophy is linked to mutations in slc a gene that encodes a transporter reportedly regulating the intracellular concentration of boron analytical quantification for determination of boron content in food or materials the colorimetric curcumin method is used boron is converted to boric acid or borates and on reaction with curcumin in acidic solution a red colored boron chelate complex rosocyanine is formed health issues and toxicity elemental boron boron oxide boric acid borates and many organoboron compounds are relatively nontoxic to humans and animals with toxicity similar to that of table salt the ld dose at which there is mortality for animals is about g per kg of body weight substances with ld above g kg are considered nontoxic an intake of g day of boric acid was reported without incident but more than this is considered toxic in more than a few doses intakes of more than grams per day for days cause minor digestive and other problems suggestive of toxicity dietary supplementation of boron may be helpful for bone growth wound healing and antioxidant activity and insufficient amount of boron in diet may result in boron deficiency single medical doses of g of boric acid for neutron capture therapy have been used without undue toxicity boric acid is more toxic to insects than to mammals and is routinely used as an insecticide the boranes boron hydrogen compounds and similar gaseous compounds are quite poisonous as usual boron is not an element that is intrinsically poisonous but the toxicity of these compounds depends on structure for another example of this phenomenon see phosphine the boranes are also highly flammable and require special care when handling some combinations of boranes and other compounds are highly explosive sodium borohydride presents a fire hazard owing to its reducing nature and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid boron halides are corrosive boron is necessary for plant growth but an excess of boron is toxic to plants and occurs particularly in acidic soil it presents as a yellowing from the tip inwards of the oldest leaves and black spots in barley leaves but it can be confused with other stresses such as magnesium deficiency in other plants ,5
Carbon,C,carbon from latin carbo coal is a chemical element with the symbol c and atomic number it is nonmetallic and tetravalent its atom making four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds it belongs to group of the periodic table carbon makes up only about percent of earth s crust three isotopes occur naturally c and c being stable while c is a radionuclide decaying with a half life of about years carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity carbon is the th most abundant element in the earth s crust and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen helium and oxygen carbon s abundance its unique diversity of organic compounds and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on earth enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life it is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass about after oxygen the atoms of carbon can bond together in diverse ways resulting in various allotropes of carbon well known allotropes include graphite diamond amorphous carbon and fullerenes the physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form for example graphite is opaque and black while diamond is highly transparent graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper hence its name from the greek verb which means to write while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity under normal conditions diamond carbon nanotubes and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials all carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form at standard temperature and pressure they are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen the most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is while is found in carbon monoxide and transition metal carbonyl complexes the largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones dolomites and carbon dioxide but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal peat oil and methane clathrates carbon forms a vast number of compounds more than any other element with almost ten million compounds described to date and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions for this reason carbon has often been referred to as the king of the elements characteristics the allotropes of carbon include graphite one of the softest known substances and diamond the hardest naturally occurring substance it bonds readily with other small atoms including other carbon atoms and is capable of forming multiple stable covalent bonds with suitable multivalent atoms carbon is known to form almost ten million compounds a large majority of all chemical compounds carbon also has the highest sublimation point of all elements at atmospheric pressure it has no melting point as its triple point is at megapascals atm psi and k c f so it sublimes at about k c f graphite is much more reactive than diamond at standard conditions despite being more thermodynamically stable as its delocalised pi system is much more vulnerable to attack for example graphite can be oxidised by hot concentrated nitric acid at standard conditions to mellitic acid c co h which preserves the hexagonal units of graphite while breaking up the larger structure carbon sublimes in a carbon arc which has a temperature of about k c or f thus irrespective of its allotropic form carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than the highest melting point metals such as tungsten or rhenium although thermodynamically prone to oxidation carbon resists oxidation more effectively than elements such as iron and copper which are weaker reducing agents at room temperature carbon is the sixth element with a ground state electron configuration of s s p of which the four outer electrons are valence electrons its first four ionisation energies and kj mol are much higher than those of the heavier group elements the electronegativity of carbon is significantly higher than the heavier group elements but close to most of the nearby nonmetals as well as some of the second and third row transition metals carbon s covalent radii are normally taken as pm c c pm c c and pm c c although these may vary depending on coordination number and what the carbon is bonded to in general covalent radius decreases with lower coordination number and higher bond order carbon based compounds form the basis of all known life on earth and the carbon nitrogen cycle provides some of the energy produced by the sun and other stars although it forms an extraordinary variety of compounds most forms of carbon are comparatively unreactive under normal conditions at standard temperature and pressure it resists all but the strongest oxidizers it does not react with sulfuric acid hydrochloric acid chlorine or any alkalis at elevated temperatures carbon reacts with oxygen to form carbon oxides and will rob oxygen from metal oxides to leave the elemental metal this exothermic reaction is used in the iron and steel industry to smelt iron and to control the carbon content of steel fe o c s o fe s co g carbon reacts with sulfur to form carbon disulfide and it reacts with steam in the coal gas reaction used in coal gasification c s h o g co g h g carbon combines with some metals at high temperatures to form metallic carbides such as the iron carbide cementite in steel and tungsten carbide widely used as an abrasive and for making hard tips for cutting tools the system of carbon allotropes spans a range of extremes allotropes atomic carbon is a very short lived species and therefore carbon is stabilized in various multi atomic structures with diverse molecular configurations called allotropes the three relatively well known allotropes of carbon are amorphous carbon graphite and diamond once considered exotic fullerenes are nowadays commonly synthesized and used in research they include buckyballs carbon nanotubes carbon nanobuds and nanofibers several other exotic allotropes have also been discovered such as lonsdaleite glassy carbon carbon nanofoam and linear acetylenic carbon carbyne graphene is a two dimensional sheet of carbon with the atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice as of graphene appears to be the strongest material ever tested the process of separating it from graphite will require some further technological development before it is economical for industrial processes if successful graphene could be used in the construction of a space elevator it could also be used to safely store hydrogen for use in a hydrogen based engine in cars the amorphous form is an assortment of carbon atoms in a non crystalline irregular glassy state not held in a crystalline macrostructure it is present as a powder and is the main constituent of substances such as charcoal lampblack soot and activated carbon at normal pressures carbon takes the form of graphite in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three others in a plane composed of fused hexagonal rings just like those in aromatic hydrocarbons the resulting network is dimensional and the resulting flat sheets are stacked and loosely bonded through weak van der waals forces this gives graphite its softness and its cleaving properties the sheets slip easily past one another because of the delocalization of one of the outer electrons of each atom to form a cloud graphite conducts electricity but only in the plane of each covalently bonded sheet this results in a lower bulk electrical conductivity for carbon than for most metals the delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of graphite over diamond at room temperature at very high pressures carbon forms the more compact allotrope diamond having nearly twice the density of graphite here each atom is bonded tetrahedrally to four others forming a dimensional network of puckered six membered rings of atoms diamond has the same cubic structure as silicon and germanium and because of the strength of the carbon carbon bonds it is the hardest naturally occurring substance measured by resistance to scratching contrary to the popular belief that diamonds are forever they are thermodynamically unstable fg diamond k kj mol under normal conditions k pa and should theoretically transform into graphite but due to a high activation energy barrier the transition into graphite is so slow at normal temperature that it is unnoticeable however at very high temperatures diamond will turn into graphite and diamonds can burn up in a house fire the bottom left corner of the phase diagram for carbon has not been scrutinized experimentally although a computational study employing density functional theory methods reached the conclusion that as t k and p pa diamond becomes more stable than graphite by approximately kj mol more recent and definitive experimental and computational studies show that graphite is more stable than diamond for t k without applied pressure by kj mol at t k and kj mol at t k under some conditions carbon crystallizes as lonsdaleite a hexagonal crystal lattice with all atoms covalently bonded and properties similar to those of diamond fullerenes are a synthetic crystalline formation with a graphite like structure but in place of flat hexagonal cells only some of the cells of which fullerenes are formed may be pentagons nonplanar hexagons or even heptagons of carbon atoms the sheets are thus warped into spheres ellipses or cylinders the properties of fullerenes split into buckyballs buckytubes and nanobuds have not yet been fully analyzed and represent an intense area of research in nanomaterials the names fullerene and buckyball are given after richard buckminster fuller popularizer of geodesic domes which resemble the structure of fullerenes the buckyballs are fairly large molecules formed completely of carbon bonded trigonally forming spheroids the best known and simplest is the soccerball shaped c buckminsterfullerene carbon nanotubes buckytubes are structurally similar to buckyballs except that each atom is bonded trigonally in a curved sheet that forms a hollow cylinder nanobuds were first reported in and are hybrid buckytube buckyball materials buckyballs are covalently bonded to the outer wall of a nanotube that combine the properties of both in a single structure of the other discovered allotropes carbon nanofoam is a ferromagnetic allotrope discovered in it consists of a low density cluster assembly of carbon atoms strung together in a loose three dimensional web in which the atoms are bonded trigonally in six and seven membered rings it is among the lightest known solids with a density of about kg m similarly glassy carbon contains a high proportion of closed porosity but contrary to normal graphite the graphitic layers are not stacked like pages in a book but have a more random arrangement linear acetylenic carbon has the chemical structure c c n carbon in this modification is linear with sp orbital hybridization and is a polymer with alternating single and triple bonds this carbyne is of considerable interest to nanotechnology as its young s modulus is times that of the hardest known material diamond in a team at the north carolina state university announced the development of another allotrope they have dubbed q carbon created by a high energy low duration laser pulse on amorphous carbon dust q carbon is reported to exhibit ferromagnetism fluorescence and a hardness superior to diamonds in the vapor phase some of the carbon is in the form of dicarbon c when excited this gas glows green occurrence carbon is the fourth most abundant chemical element in the observable universe by mass after hydrogen helium and oxygen carbon is abundant in the sun stars comets and in the atmospheres of most planets some meteorites contain microscopic diamonds that were formed when the solar system was still a protoplanetary disk microscopic diamonds may also be formed by the intense pressure and high temperature at the sites of meteorite impacts in nasa announced a greatly upgraded database for tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in the universe more than of the carbon in the universe may be associated with pahs complex compounds of carbon and hydrogen without oxygen these compounds figure in the pah world hypothesis where they are hypothesized to have a role in abiogenesis and formation of life pahs seem to have been formed a couple of billion years after the big bang are widespread throughout the universe and are associated with new stars and exoplanets it has been estimated that the solid earth as a whole contains ppm of carbon with ppm in the core and ppm in the combined mantle and crust since the mass of the earth is kg this would imply million gigatonnes of carbon this is much more than the amount of carbon in the oceans or atmosphere below in combination with oxygen in carbon dioxide carbon is found in the earth s atmosphere approximately gigatonnes of carbon each ppm corresponds to gt and dissolved in all water bodies approximately gigatonnes of carbon carbon in the biosphere has been estimated at gigatonnes but with a large uncertainty due mostly to a huge uncertainty in the amount of terrestrial deep subsurface bacteria hydrocarbons such as coal petroleum and natural gas contain carbon as well coal reserves not resources amount to around gigatonnes with perhaps gt of resources oil reserves are around gigatonnes proven sources of natural gas are about cubic metres containing about gigatonnes of carbon but studies estimate another cubic metres of unconventional deposits such as shale gas representing about gigatonnes of carbon carbon is also found in methane hydrates in polar regions and under the seas various estimates put this carbon between gt or gt in the past quantities of hydrocarbons were greater according to one source in the period from to about gigatonnes of carbon were released as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere from burning of fossil fuels another source puts the amount added to the atmosphere for the period since at gt and the total going to the atmosphere sea and land such as peat bogs at almost gt carbon is a constituent about by mass of the very large masses of carbonate rock limestone dolomite marble and so on coal is very rich in carbon anthracite contains and is the largest commercial source of mineral carbon accounting for gigatonnes or of fossil fuel as for individual carbon allotropes graphite is found in large quantities in the united states mostly in new york and texas russia mexico greenland and india natural diamonds occur in the rock kimberlite found in ancient volcanic necks or pipes most diamond deposits are in africa notably in south africa namibia botswana the republic of the congo and sierra leone diamond deposits have also been found in arkansas canada the russian arctic brazil and in northern and western australia diamonds are now also being recovered from the ocean floor off the cape of good hope diamonds are found naturally but about of all industrial diamonds used in the u s are now manufactured carbon is formed in upper layers of the troposphere and the stratosphere at altitudes of km by a reaction that is precipitated by cosmic rays thermal neutrons are produced that collide with the nuclei of nitrogen forming carbon and a proton as such of atmospheric carbon dioxide contains carbon carbon rich asteroids are relatively preponderant in the outer parts of the asteroid belt in the solar system these asteroids have not yet been directly sampled by scientists the asteroids can be used in hypothetical space based carbon mining which may be possible in the future but is currently technologically impossible isotopes isotopes of carbon are atomic nuclei that contain six protons plus a number of neutrons varying from to carbon has two stable naturally occurring isotopes the isotope carbon c forms of the carbon on earth while carbon c forms the remaining the concentration of c is further increased in biological materials because biochemical reactions discriminate against c in the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac adopted the isotope carbon as the basis for atomic weights identification of carbon in nuclear magnetic resonance nmr experiments is done with the isotope c carbon c is a naturally occurring radioisotope created in the upper atmosphere lower stratosphere and upper troposphere by interaction of nitrogen with cosmic rays it is found in trace amounts on earth of part per trillion or more mostly confined to the atmosphere and superficial deposits particularly of peat and other organic materials this isotope decays by mev emission because of its relatively short half life of years c is virtually absent in ancient rocks the amount of c in the atmosphere and in living organisms is almost constant but decreases predictably in their bodies after death this principle is used in radiocarbon dating invented in which has been used extensively to determine the age of carbonaceous materials with ages up to about years there are known isotopes of carbon and the shortest lived of these is c which decays through proton emission and alpha decay and has a half life of s the exotic c exhibits a nuclear halo which means its radius is appreciably larger than would be expected if the nucleus were a sphere of constant density formation in stars formation of the carbon atomic nucleus occurs within a giant or supergiant star through the triple alpha process this requires a nearly simultaneous collision of three alpha particles helium nuclei as the products of further nuclear fusion reactions of helium with hydrogen or another helium nucleus produce lithium and beryllium respectively both of which are highly unstable and decay almost instantly back into smaller nuclei the triple alpha process happens in conditions of temperatures over megakelvins and helium concentration that the rapid expansion and cooling of the early universe prohibited and therefore no significant carbon was created during the big bang according to current physical cosmology theory carbon is formed in the interiors of stars on the horizontal branch when massive stars die as supernova the carbon is scattered into space as dust this dust becomes component material for the formation of the next generation star systems with accreted planets the solar system is one such star system with an abundance of carbon enabling the existence of life as we know it the cno cycle is an additional hydrogen fusion mechanism that powers stars wherein carbon operates as a catalyst rotational transitions of various isotopic forms of carbon monoxide for example co co and co are detectable in the submillimeter wavelength range and are used in the study of newly forming stars in molecular clouds carbon cycle under terrestrial conditions conversion of one element to another is very rare therefore the amount of carbon on earth is effectively constant thus processes that use carbon must obtain it from somewhere and dispose of it somewhere else the paths of carbon in the environment form the carbon cycle for example photosynthetic plants draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or seawater and build it into biomass as in the calvin cycle a process of carbon fixation some of this biomass is eaten by animals while some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide the carbon cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop for example some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans if bacteria do not consume it dead plant or animal matter may become petroleum or coal which releases carbon when burned compounds organic compounds carbon can form very long chains of interconnecting carbon carbon bonds a property that is called catenation carbon carbon bonds are strong and stable through catenation carbon forms a countless number of compounds a tally of unique compounds shows that more contain carbon than do not a similar claim can be made for hydrogen because most organic compounds contain hydrogen chemically bonded to carbon or another common element like oxygen or nitrogen the simplest form of an organic molecule is the hydrocarbon a large family of organic molecules that are composed of hydrogen atoms bonded to a chain of carbon atoms a hydrocarbon backbone can be substituted by other atoms known as heteroatoms common heteroatoms that appear in organic compounds include oxygen nitrogen sulfur phosphorus and the nonradioactive halogens as well as the metals lithium and magnesium organic compounds containing bonds to metal are known as organometallic compounds see below certain groupings of atoms often including heteroatoms recur in large numbers of organic compounds these collections known as functional groups confer common reactivity patterns and allow for the systematic study and categorization of organic compounds chain length shape and functional groups all affect the properties of organic molecules in most stable compounds of carbon and nearly all stable organic compounds carbon obeys the octet rule and is tetravalent meaning that a carbon atom forms a total of four covalent bonds which may include double and triple bonds exceptions include a small number of stabilized carbocations three bonds positive charge radicals three bonds neutral carbanions three bonds negative charge and carbenes two bonds neutral although these species are much more likely to be encountered as unstable reactive intermediates carbon occurs in all known organic life and is the basis of organic chemistry when united with hydrogen it forms various hydrocarbons that are important to industry as refrigerants lubricants solvents as chemical feedstock for the manufacture of plastics and petrochemicals and as fossil fuels when combined with oxygen and hydrogen carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including sugars lignans chitins alcohols fats and aromatic esters carotenoids and terpenes with nitrogen it forms alkaloids and with the addition of sulfur also it forms antibiotics amino acids and rubber products with the addition of phosphorus to these other elements it forms dna and rna the chemical code carriers of life and adenosine triphosphate atp the most important energy transfer molecule in all living cells inorganic compounds commonly carbon containing compounds which are associated with minerals or which do not contain bonds to the other carbon atoms halogens or hydrogen are treated separately from classical organic compounds the definition is not rigid and the classification of some compounds can vary from author to author see reference articles above among these are the simple oxides of carbon the most prominent oxide is carbon dioxide co this was once the principal constituent of the paleoatmosphere but is a minor component of the earth s atmosphere today dissolved in water it forms carbonic acid h co but as most compounds with multiple single bonded oxygens on a single carbon it is unstable through this intermediate though resonance stabilized carbonate ions are produced some important minerals are carbonates notably calcite carbon disulfide cs is similar nevertheless due to its physical properties and its association with organic synthesis carbon disulfide is sometimes classified as an organic solvent the other common oxide is carbon monoxide co it is formed by incomplete combustion and is a colorless odorless gas the molecules each contain a triple bond and are fairly polar resulting in a tendency to bind permanently to hemoglobin molecules displacing oxygen which has a lower binding affinity cyanide cn has a similar structure but behaves much like a halide ion pseudohalogen for example it can form the nitride cyanogen molecule cn similar to diatomic halides likewise the heavier analog of cyanide cyaphide cp is also considered inorganic though most simple derivatives are highly unstable other uncommon oxides are carbon suboxide c o the unstable dicarbon monoxide c o carbon trioxide co cyclopentanepentone c o cyclohexanehexone c o and mellitic anhydride c o however mellitic anhydride is the triple acyl anhydride of mellitic acid moreover it contains a benzene ring thus many chemists consider it to be organic with reactive metals such as tungsten carbon forms either carbides c or acetylides c to form alloys with high melting points these anions are also associated with methane and acetylene both very weak acids with an electronegativity of carbon prefers to form covalent bonds a few carbides are covalent lattices like carborundum sic which resembles diamond nevertheless even the most polar and salt like of carbides are not completely ionic compounds organometallic compounds organometallic compounds by definition contain at least one carbon metal covalent bond a wide range of such compounds exist major classes include simple alkyl metal compounds for example tetraethyllead alkene compounds for example zeise s salt and allyl compounds for example allylpalladium chloride dimer metallocenes containing cyclopentadienyl ligands for example ferrocene and transition metal carbene complexes many metal carbonyls and metal cyanides exist for example tetracarbonylnickel and potassium ferricyanide some workers consider metal carbonyl and cyanide complexes without other carbon ligands to be purely inorganic and not organometallic however most organometallic chemists consider metal complexes with any carbon ligand even inorganic carbon e g carbonyls cyanides and certain types of carbides and acetylides to be organometallic in nature metal complexes containing organic ligands without a carbon metal covalent bond e g metal carboxylates are termed metalorganic compounds while carbon is understood to strongly prefer formation of four covalent bonds other exotic bonding schemes are also known carboranes are highly stable dodecahedral derivatives of the b h unit with one bh replaced with a ch thus the carbon is bonded to five boron atoms and one hydrogen atom the cation ph pau c contains an octahedral carbon bound to six phosphine gold fragments this phenomenon has been attributed to the aurophilicity of the gold ligands which provide additional stabilization of an otherwise labile species in nature the iron molybdenum cofactor femoco responsible for microbial nitrogen fixation likewise has an octahedral carbon center formally a carbide c iv bonded to six iron atoms in it was confirmed that in line with earlier theoretical predictions the hexamethylbenzene dication contains a carbon atom with six bonds more specifically the dication could be described structurally by the formulation mec c me making it an organic metallocene in which a mec fragment is bonded to a c me fragment through all five of the carbons of the ring it is important to note that in the cases above each of the bonds to carbon contain less than two formal electron pairs thus the formal electron count of these species does not exceed an octet this makes them hypercoordinate but not hypervalent even in cases of alleged c species that is a carbon with five ligands and a formal electron count of ten as reported by akiba and co workers electronic structure calculations conclude that the electron population around carbon is still less than eight as is true for other compounds featuring four electron three center bonding history and etymology the english name carbon comes from the latin carbo for coal and charcoal whence also comes the french charbon meaning charcoal in german dutch and danish the names for carbon are kohlenstoff koolstof and kulstof respectively all literally meaning coal substance carbon was discovered in prehistory and was known in the forms of soot and charcoal to the earliest human civilizations diamonds were known probably as early as bce in china while carbon in the form of charcoal was made around roman times by the same chemistry as it is today by heating wood in a pyramid covered with clay to exclude air in ren antoine ferchault de r aumur demonstrated that iron was transformed into steel through the absorption of some substance now known to be carbon in antoine lavoisier showed that diamonds are a form of carbon when he burned samples of charcoal and diamond and found that neither produced any water and that both released the same amount of carbon dioxide per gram in carl wilhelm scheele showed that graphite which had been thought of as a form of lead was instead identical with charcoal but with a small admixture of iron and that it gave aerial acid his name for carbon dioxide when oxidized with nitric acid in the french scientists claude louis berthollet gaspard monge and c a vandermonde confirmed that graphite was mostly carbon by oxidizing it in oxygen in much the same way lavoisier had done with diamond some iron again was left which the french scientists thought was necessary to the graphite structure in their publication they proposed the name carbone latin carbonum for the element in graphite which was given off as a gas upon burning graphite antoine lavoisier then listed carbon as an element in his textbook a new allotrope of carbon fullerene that was discovered in includes nanostructured forms such as buckyballs and nanotubes their discoverers robert curl harold kroto and richard smalley received the nobel prize in chemistry in the resulting renewed interest in new forms led to the discovery of further exotic allotropes including glassy carbon and the realization that amorphous carbon is not strictly amorphous production graphite commercially viable natural deposits of graphite occur in many parts of the world but the most important sources economically are in china india brazil and north korea graphite deposits are of metamorphic origin found in association with quartz mica and feldspars in schists gneisses and metamorphosed sandstones and limestone as lenses or veins sometimes of a metre or more in thickness deposits of graphite in borrowdale cumberland england were at first of sufficient size and purity that until the th century pencils were made by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips in wood today smaller deposits of graphite are obtained by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite out on water there are three types of natural graphite amorphous flake or crystalline flake and vein or lump amorphous graphite is the lowest quality and most abundant contrary to science in industry amorphous refers to very small crystal size rather than complete lack of crystal structure amorphous is used for lower value graphite products and is the lowest priced graphite large amorphous graphite deposits are found in china europe mexico and the united states flake graphite is less common and of higher quality than amorphous it occurs as separate plates that crystallized in metamorphic rock flake graphite can be four times the price of amorphous good quality flakes can be processed into expandable graphite for many uses such as flame retardants the foremost deposits are found in austria brazil canada china germany and madagascar vein or lump graphite is the rarest most valuable and highest quality type of natural graphite it occurs in veins along intrusive contacts in solid lumps and it is only commercially mined in sri lanka according to the usgs world production of natural graphite was million tonnes in to which china contributed t india t brazil t north korea t and canada t no natural graphite was reported mined in the united states but t of synthetic graphite with an estimated value of million was produced in diamond the diamond supply chain is controlled by a limited number of powerful businesses and is also highly concentrated in a small number of locations around the world see figure only a very small fraction of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds the ore is crushed during which care has to be taken in order to prevent larger diamonds from being destroyed in this process and subsequently the particles are sorted by density today diamonds are located in the diamond rich density fraction with the help of x ray fluorescence after which the final sorting steps are done by hand before the use of x rays became commonplace the separation was done with grease belts diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick to grease than the other minerals in the ore historically diamonds were known to be found only in alluvial deposits in southern india india led the world in diamond production from the time of their discovery in approximately the th century bc to the mid th century ad but the commercial potential of these sources had been exhausted by the late th century and at that time india was eclipsed by brazil where the first non indian diamonds were found in diamond production of primary deposits kimberlites and lamproites only started in the s after the discovery of the diamond fields in south africa production has increased over time and an accumulated total of over billion carats have been mined since that date most commercially viable diamond deposits were in russia botswana australia and the democratic republic of congo by russia produced almost one fifth of the global diamond output mostly in yakutia territory for example mir pipe and udachnaya pipe but the argyle mine in australia became the single largest source producing million carats in new finds the canadian mines at diavik and ekati are expected to become even more valuable owing to their production of gem quality stones in the united states diamonds have been found in arkansas colorado and montana in a startling discovery of a microscopic diamond in the united states led to the january bulk sampling of kimberlite pipes in a remote part of montana applications carbon is essential to all known living systems and without it life as we know it could not exist see alternative biochemistry the major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons most notably the fossil fuel methane gas and crude oil petroleum crude oil is distilled in refineries by the petrochemical industry to produce gasoline kerosene and other products cellulose is a natural carbon containing polymer produced by plants in the form of wood cotton linen and hemp cellulose is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include wool cashmere and silk plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain the raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil the uses of carbon and its compounds are extremely varied it can form alloys with iron of which the most common is carbon steel graphite is combined with clays to form the lead used in pencils used for writing and drawing it is also used as a lubricant and a pigment as a molding material in glass manufacture in electrodes for dry batteries and in electroplating and electroforming in brushes for electric motors and as a neutron moderator in nuclear reactors charcoal is used as a drawing material in artwork barbecue grilling iron smelting and in many other applications wood coal and oil are used as fuel for production of energy and heating gem quality diamond is used in jewelry and industrial diamonds are used in drilling cutting and polishing tools for machining metals and stone plastics are made from fossil hydrocarbons and carbon fiber made by pyrolysis of synthetic polyester fibers is used to reinforce plastics to form advanced lightweight composite materials carbon fiber is made by pyrolysis of extruded and stretched filaments of polyacrylonitrile pan and other organic substances the crystallographic structure and mechanical properties of the fiber depend on the type of starting material and on the subsequent processing carbon fibers made from pan have structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite but thermal processing may re order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet the result is fibers with higher specific tensile strength than steel carbon black is used as the black pigment in printing ink artist s oil paint and water colours carbon paper automotive finishes india ink and laser printer toner carbon black is also used as a filler in rubber products such as tyres and in plastic compounds activated charcoal is used as an absorbent and adsorbent in filter material in applications as diverse as gas masks water purification and kitchen extractor hoods and in medicine to absorb toxins poisons or gases from the digestive system carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron smelting case hardening of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder carbides of silicon tungsten boron and titanium are among the hardest known materials and are used as abrasives in cutting and grinding tools carbon compounds make up most of the materials used in clothing such as natural and synthetic textiles and leather and almost all of the interior surfaces in the built environment other than glass stone and metal diamonds the diamond industry falls into two categories one dealing with gem grade diamonds and the other with industrial grade diamonds while a large trade in both types of diamonds exists the two markets function dramatically differently unlike precious metals such as gold or platinum gem diamonds do not trade as a commodity there is a substantial mark up in the sale of diamonds and there is not a very active market for resale of diamonds industrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness and heat conductivity with the gemological qualities of clarity and color being mostly irrelevant about of mined diamonds equal to about million carats or tonnes annually are unsuitable for use as gemstones are relegated for industrial use known as bort synthetic diamonds invented in the s found almost immediate industrial applications billion carats tonnes of synthetic diamond is produced annually the dominant industrial use of diamond is in cutting drilling grinding and polishing most of these applications do not require large diamonds in fact most diamonds of gem quality except for their small size can be used industrially diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades or ground into a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments see diamond anvil cell high performance bearings and limited use in specialized windows with the continuing advances in the production of synthetic diamonds new applications are becoming feasible garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a semiconductor suitable for microchips and because of its exceptional heat conductance property as a heat sink in electronics precautions pure carbon has extremely low toxicity to humans and can be handled safely in the form of graphite or charcoal it is resistant to dissolution or chemical attack even in the acidic contents of the digestive tract consequently once it enters into the body s tissues it is likely to remain there indefinitely carbon black was probably one of the first pigments to be used for tattooing and tzi the iceman was found to have carbon tattoos that survived during his life and for years after his death inhalation of coal dust or soot carbon black in large quantities can be dangerous irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive lung disease coalworker s pneumoconiosis diamond dust used as an abrasive can be harmful if ingested or inhaled microparticles of carbon are produced in diesel engine exhaust fumes and may accumulate in the lungs in these examples the harm may result from contaminants e g organic chemicals heavy metals rather than from the carbon itself carbon generally has low toxicity to life on earth but carbon nanoparticles are deadly to drosophila carbon may burn vigorously and brightly in the presence of air at high temperatures large accumulations of coal which have remained inert for hundreds of millions of years in the absence of oxygen may spontaneously combust when exposed to air in coal mine waste tips ship cargo holds and coal bunkers and storage dumps in nuclear applications where graphite is used as a neutron moderator accumulation of wigner energy followed by a sudden spontaneous release may occur annealing to at least c can release the energy safely although in the windscale fire the procedure went wrong causing other reactor materials to combust the great variety of carbon compounds include such lethal poisons as tetrodotoxin the lectin ricin from seeds of the castor oil plant ricinus communis cyanide cn and carbon monoxide and such essentials to life as glucose and protein ,6
Nitrogen,N,nitrogen is the chemical element with the symbol n and atomic number nitrogen is a nonmetal and the lightest member of group of the periodic table often called the pnictogens it is a common element in the universe estimated at seventh in total abundance in the milky way and the solar system at standard temperature and pressure two atoms of the element bond to form n a colorless and odorless diatomic gas n forms about of earth s atmosphere making it the most abundant uncombined element nitrogen occurs in all organisms primarily in amino acids and thus proteins in the nucleic acids dna and rna and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate the human body contains about nitrogen by mass the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen carbon and hydrogen the nitrogen cycle describes the movement of the element from the air into the biosphere and organic compounds then back into the atmosphere many industrially important compounds such as ammonia nitric acid organic nitrates propellants and explosives and cyanides contain nitrogen the extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen n n the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide co dominates nitrogen chemistry this causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting n into useful compounds but at the same time it means that burning exploding or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems it was first discovered and isolated by scottish physician daniel rutherford in although carl wilhelm scheele and henry cavendish had independently done so at about the same time rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first the name nitrog ne was suggested by french chemist jean antoine claude chaptal in when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates antoine lavoisier suggested instead the name azote from the ancient greek no life as it is an asphyxiant gas this name is used in several languages including french italian russian romanian portuguese and turkish and appears in the english names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine azides and azo compounds apart from its use in fertilisers and energy stores nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as kevlar used in high strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class including antibiotics many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen containing signal molecules for example the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing into nitric oxide many notable nitrogen containing drugs such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters history nitrogen compounds have a very long history ammonium chloride having been known to herodotus they were well known by the middle ages alchemists knew nitric acid as aqua fortis strong water as well as other nitrogen compounds such as ammonium salts and nitrate salts the mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids was known as aqua regia royal water celebrated for its ability to dissolve gold the king of metals the discovery of nitrogen is attributed to the scottish physician daniel rutherford in who called it noxious air though he did not recognise it as an entirely different chemical substance he clearly distinguished it from joseph black s fixed air or carbon dioxide the fact that there was a component of air that does not support combustion was clear to rutherford although he was not aware that it was an element nitrogen was also studied at about the same time by carl wilhelm scheele henry cavendish and joseph priestley who referred to it as burnt air or phlogisticated air french chemist antoine lavoisier referred to nitrogen gas as mephitic air or azote from the greek word azotikos no life due to it being asphyxiant in an atmosphere of pure nitrogen animals died and flames were extinguished though lavoisier s name was not accepted in english since it was pointed out that all gases but oxygen are either asphyxiant or outright toxic it is used in many languages french italian portuguese polish russian albanian turkish etc the german stickstoff similarly refers to the same characteristic viz ersticken to choke or suffocate and still remains in english in the common names of many nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine and compounds of the azide ion finally it led to the name pnictogens for the group headed by nitrogen from the greek to choke the english word nitrogen entered the language from the french nitrog ne coined in by french chemist jean antoine chaptal from the french nitre potassium nitrate also called saltpeter and the french suffix g ne producing from the greek genes begotten chaptal s meaning was that nitrogen is the essential part of nitric acid which in turn was produced from nitre in earlier times niter had been confused with egyptian natron sodium carbonate called nitron in greek which despite the name contained no nitrate the earliest military industrial and agricultural applications of nitrogen compounds used saltpeter sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate most notably in gunpowder and later as fertiliser in lord rayleigh discovered that an electrical discharge in nitrogen gas produced active nitrogen a monatomic allotrope of nitrogen the whirling cloud of brilliant yellow light produced by his apparatus reacted with mercury to produce explosive mercury nitride for a long time sources of nitrogen compounds were limited natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions nitrogen fixation by industrial processes like the frank caro process and haber bosch process eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds to the extent that half of global food production see applications now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilisers at the same time use of the ostwald process to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large scale industrial production of nitrates as feedstock in the manufacture of explosives in the world wars of the th century properties atomic a nitrogen atom has seven electrons in the ground state they are arranged in the electron configuration s s p x p y p z it therefore has five valence electrons in the s and p orbitals three of which the p electrons are unpaired it has one of the highest electronegativities among the elements on the pauling scale exceeded only by chlorine oxygen and fluorine the light noble gases helium neon and argon would presumably also be more electronegative and in fact are on the allen scale following periodic trends its single bond covalent radius of pm is smaller than those of boron pm and carbon pm while it is larger than those of oxygen pm and fluorine pm the nitride anion n is much larger at pm similar to that of the oxide o pm and fluoride f pm anions the first three ionisation energies of nitrogen are and mj mol and the sum of the fourth and fifth is mj mol due to these very high figures nitrogen has no simple cationic chemistry the lack of radial nodes in the p subshell is directly responsible for many of the anomalous properties of the first row of the p block especially in nitrogen oxygen and fluorine the p subshell is very small and has a very similar radius to the s shell facilitating orbital hybridisation it also results in very large electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons in the s and p shells resulting in very high electronegativities hypervalency is almost unknown in the p elements for the same reason because the high electronegativity makes it difficult for a small nitrogen atom to be a central atom in an electron rich three center four electron bond since it would tend to attract the electrons strongly to itself thus despite nitrogen s position at the head of group in the periodic table its chemistry shows huge differences from that of its heavier congeners phosphorus arsenic antimony and bismuth nitrogen may be usefully compared to its horizontal neighbours carbon and oxygen as well as its vertical neighbours in the pnictogen column phosphorus arsenic antimony and bismuth although each period element from lithium to oxygen shows some similarities to the period element in the next group from magnesium to chlorine these are known as diagonal relationships their degree drops off abruptly past the boron silicon pair the similarities of nitrogen to sulfur are mostly limited to sulfur nitride ring compounds when both elements are the only ones present nitrogen does not share the proclivity of carbon for catenation like carbon nitrogen tends to form ionic or metallic compounds with metals nitrogen forms an extensive series of nitrides with carbon including those with chain graphitic and fullerenic like structures it resembles oxygen with its high electronegativity and concomitant capability for hydrogen bonding and the ability to form coordination complexes by donating its lone pairs of electrons there are some parallels between the chemistry of ammonia nh and water h o for example the capacity of both compounds to be protonated to give nh and h o or deprotonated to give nh and oh with all of these able to be isolated in solid compounds nitrogen shares with both its horizontal neighbours a preference for forming multiple bonds typically with carbon oxygen or other nitrogen atoms through p p interactions thus for example nitrogen occurs as diatomic molecules and therefore has very much lower melting c and boiling points c than the rest of its group as the n molecules are only held together by weak van der waals interactions and there are very few electrons available to create significant instantaneous dipoles this is not possible for its vertical neighbours thus the nitrogen oxides nitrites nitrates nitro nitroso azo and diazo compounds azides cyanates thiocyanates and imino derivatives find no echo with phosphorus arsenic antimony or bismuth by the same token however the complexity of the phosphorus oxoacids finds no echo with nitrogen setting aside their differences nitrogen and phosphorus form an extensive series of compounds with one another these have chain ring and cage structures table of thermal and physical properties of nitrogen n at atmospheric pressure isotopes nitrogen has two stable isotopes n and n the first is much more common making up of natural nitrogen and the second which is slightly heavier makes up the remaining this leads to an atomic weight of around u both of these stable isotopes are produced in the cno cycle in stars but n is more common as its neutron capture is the rate limiting step n is one of the five stable odd odd nuclides a nuclide having an odd number of protons and neutrons the other four are h li b and mta the relative abundance of n and n is practically constant in the atmosphere but can vary elsewhere due to natural isotopic fractionation from biological redox reactions and the evaporation of natural ammonia or nitric acid biologically mediated reactions e g assimilation nitrification and denitrification strongly control nitrogen dynamics in the soil these reactions typically result in n enrichment of the substrate and depletion of the product the heavy isotope n was first discovered by s m naud in and soon after heavy isotopes of the neighbouring elements oxygen and carbon were discovered it presents one of the lowest thermal neutron capture cross sections of all isotopes it is frequently used in nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy to determine the structures of nitrogen containing molecules due to its fractional nuclear spin of one half which offers advantages for nmr such as narrower line width n though also theoretically usable has an integer nuclear spin of one and thus has a quadrupole moment that leads to wider and less useful spectra n nmr nevertheless has complications not encountered in the more common h and c nmr spectroscopy the low natural abundance of n significantly reduces sensitivity a problem which is only exacerbated by its low gyromagnetic ratio only that of h as a result the signal to noise ratio for h is about times as much as that for n at the same magnetic field strength this may be somewhat alleviated by isotopic enrichment of n by chemical exchange or fractional distillation n enriched compounds have the advantage that under standard conditions they do not undergo chemical exchange of their nitrogen atoms with atmospheric nitrogen unlike compounds with labelled hydrogen carbon and oxygen isotopes that must be kept away from the atmosphere the n n ratio is commonly used in stable isotope analysis in the fields of geochemistry hydrology paleoclimatology and paleoceanography where it is called n of the ten other isotopes produced synthetically ranging from n to n n has a half life of ten minutes and the remaining isotopes have half lives on the order of seconds n and n or milliseconds no other nitrogen isotopes are possible as they would fall outside the nuclear drip lines leaking out a proton or neutron given the half life difference n is the most important nitrogen radioisotope being relatively long lived enough to use in positron emission tomography pet although its half life is still short and thus it must be produced at the venue of the pet for example in a cyclotron via proton bombardment of o producing n and an alpha particle the radioisotope n is the dominant radionuclide in the coolant of pressurised water reactors or boiling water reactors during normal operation it is produced from o in water via an n p reaction in which the o atom captures a neutron and expels a proton it has a short half life of about s but during its decay back to o produces high energy gamma radiation to mev because of this access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurised water reactor must be restricted during reactor power operation it is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks from the primary coolant system to the secondary steam cycle and is the primary means of detection for such leaks chemistry and compounds allotropes atomic nitrogen also known as active nitrogen is highly reactive being a triradical with three unpaired electrons free nitrogen atoms easily react with most elements to form nitrides and even when two free nitrogen atoms collide to produce an excited n molecule they may release so much energy on collision with even such stable molecules as carbon dioxide and water to cause homolytic fission into radicals such as co and o or oh and h atomic nitrogen is prepared by passing an electric discharge through nitrogen gas at mmhg which produces atomic nitrogen along with a peach yellow emission that fades slowly as an afterglow for several minutes even after the discharge terminates given the great reactivity of atomic nitrogen elemental nitrogen usually occurs as molecular n dinitrogen this molecule is a colourless odourless and tasteless diamagnetic gas at standard conditions it melts at c and boils at c dinitrogen is mostly unreactive at room temperature but it will nevertheless react with lithium metal and some transition metal complexes this is due to its bonding which is unique among the diatomic elements at standard conditions in that it has an n n triple bond triple bonds have short bond lengths in this case pm and high dissociation energies in this case kj mol and are thus very strong explaining dinitrogen s low level of chemical reactivity other nitrogen oligomers and polymers may be possible if they could be synthesised they may have potential applications as materials with a very high energy density that could be used as powerful propellants or explosives under extremely high pressures million atm and high temperatures k as produced in a diamond anvil cell nitrogen polymerises into the single bonded cubic gauche crystal structure this structure is similar to that of diamond and both have extremely strong covalent bonds resulting in its nickname nitrogen diamond at atmospheric pressure molecular nitrogen condenses liquefies at k c and freezes at k c into the beta hexagonal close packed crystal allotropic form below k c nitrogen assumes the cubic crystal allotropic form called the alpha phase liquid nitrogen a colourless fluid resembling water in appearance but with of the density the density of liquid nitrogen at its boiling point is g ml is a common cryogen solid nitrogen has many crystalline modifications it forms a significant dynamic surface coverage on pluto and outer moons of the solar system such as triton even at the low temperatures of solid nitrogen it is fairly volatile and can sublime to form an atmosphere or condense back into nitrogen frost it is very weak and flows in the form of glaciers and on triton geysers of nitrogen gas come from the polar ice cap region dinitrogen complexes the first example of a dinitrogen complex to be discovered was ru nh n see figure at right and soon many other such complexes were discovered these complexes in which a nitrogen molecule donates at least one lone pair of electrons to a central metal cation illustrate how n might bind to the metal s in nitrogenase and the catalyst for the haber process these processes involving dinitrogen activation are vitally important in biology and in the production of fertilisers dinitrogen is able to coordinate to metals in five different ways the more well characterised ways are the end on m n n and m n n m bis in which the lone pairs on the nitrogen atoms are donated to the metal cation the less well characterised ways involve dinitrogen donating electron pairs from the triple bond either as a bridging ligand to two metal cations bis or to just one the fifth and unique method involves triple coordination as a bridging ligand donating all three electron pairs from the triple bond n a few complexes feature multiple n ligands and some feature n bonded in multiple ways since n is isoelectronic with carbon monoxide co and acetylene c h the bonding in dinitrogen complexes is closely allied to that in carbonyl compounds although n is a weaker donor and acceptor than co theoretical studies show that donation is a more important factor allowing the formation of the m n bond than back donation which mostly only weakens the n n bond and end on donation is more readily accomplished than side on donation today dinitrogen complexes are known for almost all the transition metals accounting for several hundred compounds they are normally prepared by three methods replacing labile ligands such as h o h or co directly by nitrogen these are often reversible reactions that proceed at mild conditions reducing metal complexes in the presence of a suitable co ligand in excess under nitrogen gas a common choice includes replacing chloride ligands with dimethylphenylphosphine pme ph to make up for the smaller number of nitrogen ligands attached to the original chlorine ligands converting a ligand with n n bonds such as hydrazine or azide directly into a dinitrogen ligand occasionally the n n bond may be formed directly within a metal complex for example by directly reacting coordinated ammonia nh with nitrous acid hno but this is not generally applicable most dinitrogen complexes have colours within the range white yellow orange red brown a few exceptions are known such as the blue ti c h n nitrides azides and nitrido complexes nitrogen bonds to almost all the elements in the periodic table except the first three noble gases helium neon and argon and some of the very short lived elements after bismuth creating an immense variety of binary compounds with varying properties and applications in which pentazenium tetraazidoborate has the highest nitrogen content many binary compounds are known with the exception of the nitrogen hydrides oxides and fluorides these are typically called nitrides many stoichiometric phases are usually present for most elements e g mnn mn n mn n mn n mn n and mnxn for x they may be classified as salt like mostly ionic covalent diamond like and metallic or interstitial although this classification has limitations generally stemming from the continuity of bonding types instead of the discrete and separate types that it implies they are normally prepared by directly reacting a metal with nitrogen or ammonia sometimes after heating or by thermal decomposition of metal amides ca n ca n mg nh mg n h at c zn nh zn n nh many variants on these processes are possible the most ionic of these nitrides are those of the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals li n na k rb and cs do not form stable nitrides for steric reasons and m n m be mg ca sr ba these can formally be thought of as salts of the n anion although charge separation is not actually complete even for these highly electropositive elements however the alkali metal azides nan and kn featuring the linear n anion are well known as are sr n and ba n azides of the b subgroup metals those in groups through are much less ionic have more complicated structures and detonate readily when shocked many covalent binary nitrides are known examples include cyanogen cn triphosphorus pentanitride p n disulfur dinitride s n and tetrasulfur tetranitride s n the essentially covalent silicon nitride si n and germanium nitride ge n are also known silicon nitride in particular would make a promising ceramic if not for the difficulty of working with and sintering it in particular the group nitrides most of which are promising semiconductors are isoelectronic with graphite diamond and silicon carbide and have similar structures their bonding changes from covalent to partially ionic to metallic as the group is descended in particular since the b n unit is isoelectronic to c c and carbon is essentially intermediate in size between boron and nitrogen much of organic chemistry finds an echo in boron nitrogen chemistry such as in borazine inorganic benzene nevertheless the analogy is not exact due to the ease of nucleophilic attack at boron due to its deficiency in electrons which is not possible in a wholly carbon containing ring the largest category of nitrides are the interstitial nitrides of formulae mn m n and m n although variable composition is perfectly possible where the small nitrogen atoms are positioned in the gaps in a metallic cubic or hexagonal close packed lattice they are opaque very hard and chemically inert melting only at very high temperatures generally over c they have a metallic lustre and conduct electricity as do metals they hydrolyse only very slowly to give ammonia or nitrogen the nitride anion n is the strongest donor known among ligands the second strongest is o nitrido complexes are generally made by the thermal decomposition of azides or by deprotonating ammonia and they usually involve a terminal n group the linear azide anion n being isoelectronic with nitrous oxide carbon dioxide and cyanate forms many coordination complexes further catenation is rare although n isoelectronic with carbonate and nitrate is known hydrides industrially ammonia nh is the most important compound of nitrogen and is prepared in larger amounts than any other compound because it contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to food and fertilisers it is a colourless alkaline gas with a characteristic pungent smell the presence of hydrogen bonding has very significant effects on ammonia conferring on it its high melting c and boiling c points as a liquid it is a very good solvent with a high heat of vaporisation enabling it to be used in vacuum flasks that also has a low viscosity and electrical conductivity and high dielectric constant and is less dense than water however the hydrogen bonding in nh is weaker than that in h o due to the lower electronegativity of nitrogen compared to oxygen and the presence of only one lone pair in nh rather than two in h o it is a weak base in aqueous solution pkb its conjugate acid is ammonium nh it can also act as an extremely weak acid losing a proton to produce the amide anion nh it thus undergoes self dissociation similar to water to produce ammonium and amide ammonia burns in air or oxygen though not readily to produce nitrogen gas it burns in fluorine with a greenish yellow flame to give nitrogen trifluoride reactions with the other nonmetals are very complex and tend to lead to a mixture of products ammonia reacts on heating with metals to give nitrides many other binary nitrogen hydrides are known but the most important are hydrazine n h and hydrogen azide hn although it is not a nitrogen hydride hydroxylamine nh oh is similar in properties and structure to ammonia and hydrazine as well hydrazine is a fuming colourless liquid that smells similar to ammonia its physical properties are very similar to those of water melting point c boiling point c density g cm despite it being an endothermic compound it is kinetically stable it burns quickly and completely in air very exothermically to give nitrogen and water vapour it is a very useful and versatile reducing agent and is a weaker base than ammonia it is also commonly used as a rocket fuel hydrazine is generally made by reaction of ammonia with alkaline sodium hypochlorite in the presence of gelatin or glue nh ocl nh cl oh nh cl nh n h cl slow n h oh n h h o fast the attacks by hydroxide and ammonia may be reversed thus passing through the intermediate nhcl instead the reason for adding gelatin is that it removes metal ions such as cu that catalyses the destruction of hydrazine by reaction with monochloramine nh cl to produce ammonium chloride and nitrogen hydrogen azide hn was first produced in by the oxidation of aqueous hydrazine by nitrous acid it is very explosive and even dilute solutions can be dangerous it has a disagreeable and irritating smell and is a potentially lethal but not cumulative poison it may be considered the conjugate acid of the azide anion and is similarly analogous to the hydrohalic acids halides and oxohalides all four simple nitrogen trihalides are known a few mixed halides and hydrohalides are known but are mostly unstable examples include nclf ncl f nbrf nf h nfh ncl h and nclh five nitrogen fluorides are known nitrogen trifluoride nf first prepared in is a colourless and odourless gas that is thermodynamically stable and most readily produced by the electrolysis of molten ammonium fluoride dissolved in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride like carbon tetrafluoride it is not at all reactive and is stable in water or dilute aqueous acids or alkalis only when heated does it act as a fluorinating agent and it reacts with copper arsenic antimony and bismuth on contact at high temperatures to give tetrafluorohydrazine n f the cations nf and n f are also known the latter from reacting tetrafluorohydrazine with strong fluoride acceptors such as arsenic pentafluoride as is onf which has aroused interest due to the short n o distance implying partial double bonding and the highly polar and long n f bond tetrafluorohydrazine unlike hydrazine itself can dissociate at room temperature and above to give the radical nf fluorine azide fn is very explosive and thermally unstable dinitrogen difluoride n f exists as thermally interconvertible cis and trans isomers and was first found as a product of the thermal decomposition of fn nitrogen trichloride ncl is a dense volatile and explosive liquid whose physical properties are similar to those of carbon tetrachloride although one difference is that ncl is easily hydrolysed by water while ccl is not it was first synthesised in by pierre louis dulong who lost three fingers and an eye to its explosive tendencies as a dilute gas it is less dangerous and is thus used industrially to bleach and sterilise flour nitrogen tribromide nbr first prepared in is a deep red temperature sensitive volatile solid that is explosive even at c nitrogen triiodide ni is still more unstable and was only prepared in its adduct with ammonia which was known earlier is very shock sensitive it can be set off by the touch of a feather shifting air currents or even alpha particles for this reason small amounts of nitrogen triiodide are sometimes synthesised as a demonstration to high school chemistry students or as an act of chemical magic chlorine azide cln and bromine azide brn are extremely sensitive and explosive two series of nitrogen oxohalides are known the nitrosyl halides xno and the nitryl halides xno the first is very reactive gases that can be made by directly halogenating nitrous oxide nitrosyl fluoride nof is colourless and a vigorous fluorinating agent nitrosyl chloride nocl behaves in much the same way and has often been used as an ionising solvent nitrosyl bromide nobr is red the reactions of the nitryl halides are mostly similar nitryl fluoride fno and nitryl chloride clno are likewise reactive gases and vigorous halogenating agents oxides nitrogen forms nine molecular oxides some of which were the first gases to be identified n o nitrous oxide no nitric oxide n o dinitrogen trioxide no nitrogen dioxide n o dinitrogen tetroxide n o dinitrogen pentoxide n o nitrosylazide and n no trinitramide all are thermally unstable towards decomposition to their elements one other possible oxide that has not yet been synthesised is oxatetrazole n o an aromatic ring nitrous oxide n o better known as laughing gas is made by thermal decomposition of molten ammonium nitrate at c this is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts it is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for sprayed canned whipped cream and was formerly commonly used as an anaesthetic despite appearances it cannot be considered to be the anhydride of hyponitrous acid h n o because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of nitrous oxide in water it is rather unreactive not reacting with the halogens the alkali metals or ozone at room temperature although reactivity increases upon heating and has the unsymmetrical structure n n o n n o n n o above c it dissociates by breaking the weaker n o bond nitric oxide no is the simplest stable molecule with an odd number of electrons in mammals including humans it is an important cellular signaling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes it is formed by catalytic oxidation of ammonia it is a colourless paramagnetic gas that being thermodynamically unstable decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen gas at c its bonding is similar to that in nitrogen but one extra electron is added to a antibonding orbital and thus the bond order has been reduced to approximately hence dimerisation to o n n o is unfavourable except below the boiling point where the cis isomer is more stable because it does not actually increase the total bond order and because the unpaired electron is delocalised across the no molecule granting it stability there is also evidence for the asymmetric red dimer o n o n when nitric oxide is condensed with polar molecules it reacts with oxygen to give brown nitrogen dioxide and with halogens to give nitrosyl halides it also reacts with transition metal compounds to give nitrosyl complexes most of which are deeply coloured blue dinitrogen trioxide n o is only available as a solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide nitrogen dioxide no and dinitrogen tetroxide n o the latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by heterolytic fission to nitrosonium and nitrate in a medium with high dielectric constant nitrogen dioxide is an acrid corrosive brown gas both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate both react with water to form nitric acid dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the united states and ussr by the late s this is because it is a hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine based rocket fuel and can be easily stored since it is liquid at room temperature the thermally unstable and very reactive dinitrogen pentoxide n o is the anhydride of nitric acid and can be made from it by dehydration with phosphorus pentoxide it is of interest for the preparation of explosives it is a deliquescent colourless crystalline solid that is sensitive to light in the solid state it is ionic with structure no no as a gas and in solution it is molecular o n o no hydration to nitric acid comes readily as does analogous reaction with hydrogen peroxide giving peroxonitric acid hoono it is a violent oxidising agent gaseous dinitrogen pentoxide decomposes as follows n o no no no o no n o no no oxoacids oxoanions and oxoacid salts many nitrogen oxoacids are known though most of them are unstable as pure compounds and are known only as aqueous solutions or as salts hyponitrous acid h n o is a weak diprotic acid with the structure hon noh pka pka acidic solutions are quite stable but above ph base catalysed decomposition occurs via honno to nitrous oxide and the hydroxide anion hyponitrites involving the n o anion are stable to reducing agents and more commonly act as reducing agents themselves they are an intermediate step in the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite which occurs in the nitrogen cycle hyponitrite can act as a bridging or chelating bidentate ligand nitrous acid hno is not known as a pure compound but is a common component in gaseous equilibria and is an important aqueous reagent its aqueous solutions may be made from acidifying cool aqueous nitrite no bent solutions although already at room temperature disproportionation to nitrate and nitric oxide is significant it is a weak acid with pka at c they may be titrimetrically analysed by their oxidation to nitrate by permanganate they are readily reduced to nitrous oxide and nitric oxide by sulfur dioxide to hyponitrous acid with tin ii and to ammonia with hydrogen sulfide salts of hydrazinium n h react with nitrous acid to produce azides which further react to give nitrous oxide and nitrogen sodium nitrite is mildly toxic in concentrations above mg kg but small amounts are often used to cure meat and as a preservative to avoid bacterial spoilage it is also used to synthesise hydroxylamine and to diazotise primary aromatic amines as follows arnh hno arnn cl h onitrite is also a common ligand that can coordinate in five ways the most common are nitro bonded from the nitrogen and nitrito bonded from an oxygen nitro nitrito isomerism is common where the nitrito form is usually less stable nitric acid hno is by far the most important and the most stable of the nitrogen oxoacids it is one of the three most used acids the other two being sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid and was first discovered by alchemists in the th century it is made by the catalytic oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide which is oxidised to nitrogen dioxide and then dissolved in water to give concentrated nitric acid in the united states of america over seven million tonnes of nitric acid are produced every year most of which is used for nitrate production for fertilisers and explosives among other uses anhydrous nitric acid may be made by distilling concentrated nitric acid with phosphorus pentoxide at low pressure in glass apparatus in the dark it can only be made in the solid state because upon melting it spontaneously decomposes to nitrogen dioxide and liquid nitric acid undergoes self ionisation to a larger extent than any other covalent liquid as follows hno h no no h o no no two hydrates hno h o and hno h o are known that can be crystallised it is a strong acid and concentrated solutions are strong oxidising agents though gold platinum rhodium and iridium are immune to attack a mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and nitric acid called aqua regia is still stronger and successfully dissolves gold and platinum because free chlorine and nitrosyl chloride are formed and chloride anions can form strong complexes in concentrated sulfuric acid nitric acid is protonated to form nitronium which can act as an electrophile for aromatic nitration hno h so no h o hso the thermal stabilities of nitrates involving the trigonal planar no anion depends on the basicity of the metal and so do the products of decomposition thermolysis which can vary between the nitrite for example sodium the oxide potassium and lead or even the metal itself silver depending on their relative stabilities nitrate is also a common ligand with many modes of coordination finally although orthonitric acid h no which would be analogous to orthophosphoric acid does not exist the tetrahedral orthonitrate anion no is known in its sodium and potassium salts nano na o c for days ag crucible na no displaystyle ce nano na o ce ag crucible ce circ c for days na no these white crystalline salts are very sensitive to water vapour and carbon dioxide in the air na no h o co nano naoh nahco despite its limited chemistry the orthonitrate anion is interesting from a structural point of view due to its regular tetrahedral shape and the short n o bond lengths implying significant polar character to the bonding organic nitrogen compounds nitrogen is one of the most important elements in organic chemistry many organic functional groups involve a carbon nitrogen bond such as amides rconr amines r n imines rc nr r imides rco nr azides rn azo compounds rn r cyanates and isocyanates rocn or rcno nitrates rono nitriles and isonitriles rcn or rnc nitrites rono nitro compounds rno nitroso compounds rno oximes rcr noh and pyridine derivatives c n bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen in these compounds nitrogen is usually trivalent though it can be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts r n with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton this may be offset by other factors for example amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond though they may act as acids at very low ph being protonated at the oxygen and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring the amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the kjeldahl method in particular nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids amino acids and thus proteins and the energy carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on earth occurrence nitrogen is the most common pure element in the earth making up of the volume of the atmosphere by mass around million gigatonnes despite this it is not very abundant in earth s crust making up somewhere around parts per million of this on par with niobium gallium and lithium this represents to a million gigatonnes of nitrogen depending on the mass of the crust the only important nitrogen minerals are nitre potassium nitrate saltpetre and soda nitre sodium nitrate chilean saltpetre however these have not been an important source of nitrates since the s when the industrial synthesis of ammonia and nitric acid became common nitrogen compounds constantly interchange between the atmosphere and living organisms nitrogen must first be processed or fixed into a plant usable form usually ammonia some nitrogen fixation is done by lightning strikes producing the nitrogen oxides but most is done by diazotrophic bacteria through enzymes known as nitrogenases although today industrial nitrogen fixation to ammonia is also significant when the ammonia is taken up by plants it is used to synthesise proteins these plants are then digested by animals who use the nitrogen compounds to synthesise their proteins and excrete nitrogen bearing waste finally these organisms die and decompose undergoing bacterial and environmental oxidation and denitrification returning free dinitrogen to the atmosphere industrial nitrogen fixation by the haber process is mostly used as fertiliser although excess nitrogen bearing waste when leached leads to eutrophication of freshwater and the creation of marine dead zones as nitrogen driven bacterial growth depletes water oxygen to the point that all higher organisms die furthermore nitrous oxide which is produced during denitrification attacks the atmospheric ozone layer many saltwater fish manufacture large amounts of trimethylamine oxide to protect them from the high osmotic effects of their environment conversion of this compound to dimethylamine is responsible for the early odour in unfresh saltwater fish in animals free radical nitric oxide derived from an amino acid serves as an important regulatory molecule for circulation nitric oxide s rapid reaction with water in animals results in the production of its metabolite nitrite animal metabolism of nitrogen in proteins in general results in the excretion of urea while animal metabolism of nucleic acids results in the excretion of urea and uric acid the characteristic odour of animal flesh decay is caused by the creation of long chain nitrogen containing amines such as putrescine and cadaverine which are breakdown products of the amino acids ornithine and lysine respectively in decaying proteins production nitrogen gas is an industrial gas produced by the fractional distillation of liquid air or by mechanical means using gaseous air pressurised reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing adsorption nitrogen gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption psa are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk delivered nitrogen commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes when supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called ofn oxygen free nitrogen commercial grade nitrogen already contains at most ppm oxygen and specially purified grades containing at most ppm oxygen and ppm argon are also available in a chemical laboratory it is prepared by treating an aqueous solution of ammonium chloride with sodium nitrite nh cl nano n nacl h osmall amounts of the impurities no and hno are also formed in this reaction the impurities can be removed by passing the gas through aqueous sulfuric acid containing potassium dichromate very pure nitrogen can be prepared by the thermal decomposition of barium azide or sodium azide nan na n applications gas the applications of nitrogen compounds are naturally extremely widely varied due to the huge size of this class hence only applications of pure nitrogen itself will be considered here two thirds of nitrogen produced by industry is sold as gas and the remaining one third as a liquid the gas is mostly used as a low reactivity safe atmosphere wherever the oxygen in the air would pose a fire explosion or oxidising hazard some examples include as a modified atmosphere pure or mixed with carbon dioxide to nitrogenate and preserve the freshness of packaged or bulk foods by delaying rancidity and other forms of oxidative damage pure nitrogen as food additive is labeled in the european union with the e number e in incandescent light bulbs as an inexpensive alternative to argon in fire suppression systems for information technology it equipment in the manufacture of stainless steel in the case hardening of steel by nitriding in some aircraft fuel systems to reduce fire hazard see inerting system to inflate race car and aircraft tires reducing the problems of inconsistent expansion and contraction caused by moisture and oxygen in natural air nitrogen is commonly used during sample preparation in chemical analysis it is used to concentrate and reduce the volume of liquid samples directing a pressurised stream of nitrogen gas perpendicular to the surface of the liquid causes the solvent to evaporate while leaving the solute s and un evaporated solvent behind nitrogen can be used as a replacement or in combination with carbon dioxide to pressurise kegs of some beers particularly stouts and british ales due to the smaller bubbles it produces which makes the dispensed beer smoother and headier a pressure sensitive nitrogen capsule known commonly as a widget allows nitrogen charged beers to be packaged in cans and bottles nitrogen tanks are also replacing carbon dioxide as the main power source for paintball guns nitrogen must be kept at a higher pressure than co making n tanks heavier and more expensive equipment some construction equipment uses pressurized nitrogen gas to help hydraulic system to provide extra power to devices such as hydraulic hammer nitrogen gas formed from the decomposition of sodium azide is used for the inflation of airbags euthanasia as nitrogen is an asphyxiant gas some jurisdictions have considered asphyxiation by inhalation of pure nitrogen as a means of capital punishment as a substitute for lethal injection however as of no executions using nitrogen gas have yet been carried out by any jurisdiction and at least one jurisdiction oklahoma which had considered nitrogen asphyxiation as an execution protocol had abandoned the effort liquid liquid nitrogen is a cryogenic liquid which looks like water when insulated in proper containers such as dewar flasks it can be transported and stored with a low rate of evaporative loss like dry ice the main use of liquid nitrogen is for cooling to low temperatures it is used in the cryopreservation of biological materials such as blood and reproductive cells sperm and eggs it is used in cryotherapy to remove cysts and warts on the skin by freezing them it is used in laboratory cold traps and in cryopumps to obtain lower pressures in vacuum pumped systems it is used to cool heat sensitive electronics such as infrared detectors and x ray detectors other uses include freeze grinding and machining materials that are soft or rubbery at room temperature shrink fitting and assembling engineering components and more generally to attain very low temperatures where necessary because of its low cost liquid nitrogen is often used for cooling even when such low temperatures are not strictly necessary such as refrigeration of food freeze branding livestock freezing pipes to halt flow when valves are not present and consolidating unstable soil by freezing whenever excavation is going on underneath safety gas although nitrogen is non toxic when released into an enclosed space it can displace oxygen and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard this may happen with few warning symptoms since the human carotid body is a relatively poor and slow low oxygen hypoxia sensing system an example occurred shortly before the launch of the first space shuttle mission on march when two technicians died from asphyxiation after they walked into a space located in the space shuttle s mobile launcher platform that was pressurised with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire when inhaled at high partial pressures more than about bar encountered at depths below about m in scuba diving nitrogen is an anesthetic agent causing nitrogen narcosis a temporary state of mental impairment similar to nitrous oxide intoxication nitrogen dissolves in the blood and body fats rapid decompression as when divers ascend too quickly or astronauts decompress too quickly from cabin pressure to spacesuit pressure can lead to a potentially fatal condition called decompression sickness formerly known as caisson sickness or the bends when nitrogen bubbles form in the bloodstream nerves joints and other sensitive or vital areas bubbles from other inert gases gases other than carbon dioxide and oxygen cause the same effects so replacement of nitrogen in breathing gases may prevent nitrogen narcosis but does not prevent decompression sickness liquid as a cryogenic liquid liquid nitrogen can be dangerous by causing cold burns on contact although the leidenfrost effect provides protection for very short exposure about one second ingestion of liquid nitrogen can cause severe internal damage for example in a young woman in england had to have her stomach removed after ingesting a cocktail made with liquid nitrogen because the liquid to gas expansion ratio of nitrogen is at c a tremendous amount of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporised in an enclosed space in an incident on january at texas a m university the pressure relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed as a result of the subsequent pressure buildup the tank failed catastrophically the force of the explosion was sufficient to propel the tank through the ceiling immediately above it shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it and blow the walls of the laboratory m off their foundations liquid nitrogen readily evaporates to form gaseous nitrogen and hence the precautions associated with gaseous nitrogen also apply to liquid nitrogen for example oxygen sensors are sometimes used as a safety precaution when working with liquid nitrogen to alert workers of gas spills into a confined space vessels containing liquid nitrogen can condense oxygen from air the liquid in such a vessel becomes increasingly enriched in oxygen boiling point c higher than that of nitrogen as the nitrogen evaporates and can cause violent oxidation of organic material oxygen deficiency monitors oxygen deficiency monitors are used to measure levels of oxygen in confined spaces and any place where nitrogen gas or liquid are stored or used in the event of a nitrogen leak and a decrease in oxygen to a pre set alarm level an oxygen deficiency monitor can be programmed to set off audible and visual alarms thereby providing notification of the possible impending danger most commonly the oxygen range to alert personnel is when oxygen levels get below osha specifies that a hazardous atmosphere may include one where the oxygen concentration is below or above oxygen deficiency monitors can either be fixed mounted to the wall and hard wired into the building s power supply or simply plugged into a power outlet or a portable hand held or wearable monitor ,7
Oxygen,O,oxygen is the chemical element with the symbol o and atomic number it is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table a highly reactive nonmetal and an oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds oxygen is earth s most abundant element and after hydrogen and helium it is the third most abundant element in the universe at standard temperature and pressure two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula o diatomic oxygen gas currently constitutes of the earth s atmosphere though this has changed considerably over long periods of time oxygen makes up almost half of the earth s crust in the form of oxides many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms such as proteins nucleic acids carbohydrates and fats as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells teeth and bone most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water the major constituent of lifeforms oxygen is continuously replenished in earth s atmosphere by photosynthesis which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water and carbon dioxide oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms another form allotrope of oxygen ozone o strongly absorbs ultraviolet uvb radiation and the high altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation however ozone present at the surface is a byproduct of smog and thus a pollutant oxygen was isolated by michael sendivogius before but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by carl wilhelm scheele in uppsala in or earlier and joseph priestley in wiltshire in priority is often given for priestley because his work was published first priestley however called oxygen dephlogisticated air and did not recognize it as a chemical element the name oxygen was coined in by antoine lavoisier who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion common uses of oxygen include production of steel plastics and textiles brazing welding and cutting of steels and other metals rocket propellant oxygen therapy and life support systems in aircraft submarines spaceflight and diving history of study early experiments one of the first known experiments on the relationship between combustion and air was conducted by the nd century bce greek writer on mechanics philo of byzantium in his work pneumatica philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel s neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass many centuries later leonardo da vinci built on philo s work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration in the late th century robert boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion english chemist john mayow refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus in one experiment he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one fourteenth of the air s volume before extinguishing the subjects from this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion mayow observed that antimony increased in weight when heated and inferred that the nitroaereus must have combined with it he also thought that the lungs separate nitroaereus from air and pass it into the blood and that animal heat and muscle movement result from the reaction of nitroaereus with certain substances in the body accounts of these and other experiments and ideas were published in in his work tractatus duo in the tract de respiratione phlogiston theory robert hooke ole borch mikhail lomonosov and pierre bayen all produced oxygen in experiments in the th and the th century but none of them recognized it as a chemical element this may have been in part due to the prevalence of the philosophy of combustion and corrosion called the phlogiston theory which was then the favored explanation of those processes established in by the german alchemist j j becher and modified by the chemist georg ernst stahl by phlogiston theory stated that all combustible materials were made of two parts one part called phlogiston was given off when the substance containing it was burned while the dephlogisticated part was thought to be its true form or calx highly combustible materials that leave little residue such as wood or coal were thought to be made mostly of phlogiston non combustible substances that corrode such as iron contained very little air did not play a role in phlogiston theory nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea instead it was based on observations of what happens when something burns that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process discovery polish alchemist philosopher and physician michael sendivogius micha s dziw j in his work de lapide philosophorum tractatus duodecim e naturae fonte et manuali experientia depromti described a substance contained in air referring to it as cibus vitae food of life and according to polish historian roman bugaj this substance is identical with oxygen sendivogius during his experiments performed between and properly recognized that the substance is equivalent to the gaseous byproduct released by the thermal decomposition of potassium nitrate in bugaj s view the isolation of oxygen and the proper association of the substance to that part of air which is required for life provides sufficient evidence for the discovery of oxygen by sendivogius this discovery of sendivogius was however frequently denied by the generations of scientists and chemists which succeeded him it is also commonly claimed that oxygen was first discovered by swedish pharmacist carl wilhelm scheele he had produced oxygen gas by heating mercuric oxide hgo and various nitrates in scheele called the gas fire air because it was then the only known agent to support combustion he wrote an account of this discovery in a manuscript titled treatise on air and fire which he sent to his publisher in that document was published in in the meantime on august an experiment conducted by the british clergyman joseph priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide contained in a glass tube which liberated a gas he named dephlogisticated air he noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it after breathing the gas himself priestley wrote the feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air but i fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards priestley published his findings in in a paper titled an account of further discoveries in air which was included in the second volume of his book titled experiments and observations on different kinds of air because he published his findings first priestley is usually given priority in the discovery the french chemist antoine laurent lavoisier later claimed to have discovered the new substance independently priestley visited lavoisier in october and told him about his experiment and how he liberated the new gas scheele had also dispatched a letter to lavoisier on september which described his discovery of the previously unknown substance but lavoisier never acknowledged receiving it a copy of the letter was found in scheele s belongings after his death lavoisier s contribution lavoisier conducted the first adequate quantitative experiments on oxidation and gave the first correct explanation of how combustion works he used these and similar experiments all started in to discredit the phlogiston theory and to prove that the substance discovered by priestley and scheele was a chemical element in one experiment lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase in weight when tin and air were heated in a closed container he noted that air rushed in when he opened the container which indicated that part of the trapped air had been consumed he also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in this and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book sur la combustion en g n ral which was published in in that work he proved that air is a mixture of two gases vital air which is essential to combustion and respiration and azote gk lifeless which did not support either azote later became nitrogen in english although it has kept the earlier name in french and several other european languages etymology lavoisier renamed vital air to oxyg ne in from the greek roots oxys acid literally sharp from the taste of acids and gen s producer literally begetter because he mistakenly believed that oxygen was a constituent of all acids chemists such as sir humphry davy in eventually determined that lavoisier was wrong in this regard but by then the name was too well established oxygen entered the english language despite opposition by english scientists and the fact that the englishman priestley had first isolated the gas and written about it this is partly due to a poem praising the gas titled oxygen in the popular book the botanic garden by erasmus darwin grandfather of charles darwin later history john dalton s original atomic hypothesis presumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another for example dalton assumed that water s formula was ho leading to the conclusion that the atomic mass of oxygen was times that of hydrogen instead of the modern value of about in joseph louis gay lussac and alexander von humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen and by amedeo avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of water s composition based on what is now called avogadro s law and the diatomic elemental molecules in those gases the first commercial method of producing oxygen was chemical the so called brin process involving a reversible reaction of barium oxide it was invented in and commercialized in but was displaced by newer methods in early th century by the late th century scientists realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it using a cascade method swiss chemist and physicist raoul pierre pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide in order to liquefy carbon dioxide which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it he sent a telegram on december to the french academy of sciences in paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen just two days later french physicist louis paul cailletet announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen only a few drops of the liquid were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted oxygen was liquefied in a stable state for the first time on march by polish scientists from jagiellonian university zygmunt wr blewski and karol olszewski in scottish chemist james dewar was able to produce enough liquid oxygen for study the first commercially viable process for producing liquid oxygen was independently developed in by german engineer carl von linde and british engineer william hampson both men lowered the temperature of air until it liquefied and then distilled the component gases by boiling them off one at a time and capturing them separately later in oxyacetylene welding was demonstrated for the first time by burning a mixture of acetylene and compressed o this method of welding and cutting metal later became common in the american scientist robert h goddard became the first person to develop a rocket engine that burned liquid fuel the engine used gasoline for fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer goddard successfully flew a small liquid fueled rocket m at km h on march in auburn massachusetts us in academic laboratories oxygen can be prepared by heating together potassium chlorate mixed with a small proportion of manganese dioxide oxygen levels in the atmosphere are trending slightly downward globally possibly because of fossil fuel burning characteristics properties and molecular structure at standard temperature and pressure oxygen is a colorless odorless and tasteless gas with the molecular formula o referred to as dioxygen as dioxygen two oxygen atoms are chemically bound to each other the bond can be variously described based on level of theory but is reasonably and simply described as a covalent double bond that results from the filling of molecular orbitals formed from the atomic orbitals of the individual oxygen atoms the filling of which results in a bond order of two more specifically the double bond is the result of sequential low to high energy or aufbau filling of orbitals and the resulting cancellation of contributions from the s electrons after sequential filling of the low and orbitals overlap of the two atomic p orbitals that lie along the o o molecular axis and overlap of two pairs of atomic p orbitals perpendicular to the o o molecular axis and then cancellation of contributions from the remaining two p electrons after their partial filling of the orbitals this combination of cancellations and and overlaps results in dioxygen s double bond character and reactivity and a triplet electronic ground state an electron configuration with two unpaired electrons as is found in dioxygen orbitals see the filled orbitals in the diagram that are of equal energy i e degenerate is a configuration termed a spin triplet state hence the ground state of the o molecule is referred to as triplet oxygen the highest energy partially filled orbitals are antibonding and so their filling weakens the bond order from three to two because of its unpaired electrons triplet oxygen reacts only slowly with most organic molecules which have paired electron spins this prevents spontaneous combustion in the triplet form o molecules are paramagnetic that is they impart magnetic character to oxygen when it is in the presence of a magnetic field because of the spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule and the negative exchange energy between neighboring o molecules liquid oxygen is so magnetic that in laboratory demonstrations a bridge of liquid oxygen may be supported against its own weight between the poles of a powerful magnet singlet oxygen is a name given to several higher energy species of molecular o in which all the electron spins are paired it is much more reactive with common organic molecules than is normal triplet molecular oxygen in nature singlet oxygen is commonly formed from water during photosynthesis using the energy of sunlight it is also produced in the troposphere by the photolysis of ozone by light of short wavelength and by the immune system as a source of active oxygen carotenoids in photosynthetic organisms and possibly animals play a major role in absorbing energy from singlet oxygen and converting it to the unexcited ground state before it can cause harm to tissues allotropes the common allotrope of elemental oxygen on earth is called dioxygen o the major part of the earth s atmospheric oxygen see occurrence o has a bond length of pm and a bond energy of kj mol o is used by complex forms of life such as animals in cellular respiration other aspects of o are covered in the remainder of this article trioxygen o is usually known as ozone and is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen that is damaging to lung tissue ozone is produced in the upper atmosphere when o combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of o by ultraviolet uv radiation since ozone absorbs strongly in the uv region of the spectrum the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet near the earth s surface it is a pollutant formed as a by product of automobile exhaust at low earth orbit altitudes sufficient atomic oxygen is present to cause corrosion of spacecraft the metastable molecule tetraoxygen o was discovered in and was assumed to exist in one of the six phases of solid oxygen it was proven in that this phase created by pressurizing o to gpa is in fact a rhombohedral o cluster this cluster has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either o or o and may therefore be used in rocket fuel a metallic phase was discovered in when solid oxygen is subjected to a pressure of above gpa and it was shown in that at very low temperatures this phase becomes superconducting physical properties oxygen dissolves more readily in water than in nitrogen and in freshwater more readily than in seawater water in equilibrium with air contains approximately molecule of dissolved o for every molecules of n compared with an atmospheric ratio of approximately the solubility of oxygen in water is temperature dependent and about twice as much mg l dissolves at c than at c mg l at c and standard atmosphere kpa of air freshwater can dissolve about milliliters ml of oxygen per liter and seawater contains about ml per liter at c the solubility increases to ml more than at c per liter for freshwater and ml more per liter for sea water oxygen condenses at k c f and freezes at k c f both liquid and solid o are clear substances with a light sky blue color caused by absorption in the red in contrast with the blue color of the sky which is due to rayleigh scattering of blue light high purity liquid o is usually obtained by the fractional distillation of liquefied air liquid oxygen may also be condensed from air using liquid nitrogen as a coolant liquid oxygen is a highly reactive substance and must be segregated from combustible materials the spectroscopy of molecular oxygen is associated with the atmospheric processes of aurora and airglow the absorption in the herzberg continuum and schumann runge bands in the ultraviolet produces atomic oxygen that is important in the chemistry of the middle atmosphere excited state singlet molecular oxygen is responsible for red chemiluminescence in solution table of thermal and physical properties of oxygen o at atmospheric pressure isotopes and stellar origin naturally occurring oxygen is composed of three stable isotopes o o and o with o being the most abundant natural abundance most o is synthesized at the end of the helium fusion process in massive stars but some is made in the neon burning process o is primarily made by the burning of hydrogen into helium during the cno cycle making it a common isotope in the hydrogen burning zones of stars most o is produced when n made abundant from cno burning captures a he nucleus making o common in the helium rich zones of evolved massive stars fourteen radioisotopes have been characterized the most stable are o with a half life of seconds and o with a half life of seconds all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are less than s and the majority of these have half lives that are less than milliseconds the most common decay mode of the isotopes lighter than o is decay to yield nitrogen and the most common mode for the isotopes heavier than o is beta decay to yield fluorine occurrence oxygen is the most abundant chemical element by mass in the earth s biosphere air sea and land oxygen is the third most abundant chemical element in the universe after hydrogen and helium about of the sun s mass is oxygen oxygen constitutes of the earth s crust by mass as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide and is the most abundant element by mass in the earth s crust it is also the major component of the world s oceans by mass oxygen gas is the second most common component of the earth s atmosphere taking up of its volume and of its mass some tonnes earth is unusual among the planets of the solar system in having such a high concentration of oxygen gas in its atmosphere mars with o by volume and venus have much less the o surrounding those planets is produced solely by the action of ultraviolet radiation on oxygen containing molecules such as carbon dioxide the unusually high concentration of oxygen gas on earth is the result of the oxygen cycle this biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on earth the atmosphere the biosphere and the lithosphere the main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis which is responsible for modern earth s atmosphere photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere while respiration decay and combustion remove it from the atmosphere in the present equilibrium production and consumption occur at the same rate free oxygen also occurs in solution in the world s water bodies the increased solubility of o at lower temperatures see physical properties has important implications for ocean life as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce the o content in eutrophic water bodies scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water s biochemical oxygen demand or the amount of o needed to restore it to a normal concentration analysis paleoclimatologists measure the ratio of oxygen and oxygen in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to determine the climate millions of years ago see oxygen isotope ratio cycle seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope oxygen evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the heavier oxygen and this disparity increases at lower temperatures during periods of lower global temperatures snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples as old as hundreds of thousands of years planetary geologists have measured the relative quantities of oxygen isotopes in samples from the earth the moon mars and meteorites but were long unable to obtain reference values for the isotope ratios in the sun believed to be the same as those of the primordial solar nebula analysis of a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space and returned by the crashed genesis spacecraft has shown that the sun has a higher proportion of oxygen than does the earth the measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen from the sun s disk of protoplanetary material prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the earth oxygen presents two spectrophotometric absorption bands peaking at the wavelengths and nm some remote sensing scientists have proposed using the measurement of the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform this approach exploits the fact that in those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation s reflectance from its fluorescence which is much weaker the measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal to noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale biological production and role of o photosynthesis and respiration in nature free oxygen is produced by the light driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis according to some estimates green algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about of the free oxygen produced on earth and the rest is produced by terrestrial plants other estimates of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric oxygen are higher while some estimates are lower suggesting oceans produce of earth s atmospheric oxygen each year a simplified overall formula for photosynthesis is co h o photons c h o o or simply carbon dioxide water sunlight glucose dioxygenphotolytic oxygen evolution occurs in the thylakoid membranes of photosynthetic organisms and requires the energy of four photons many steps are involved but the result is the formation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane which is used to synthesize adenosine triphosphate atp via photophosphorylation the o remaining after production of the water molecule is released into the atmosphere oxygen is used in mitochondria in the generation of atp during oxidative phosphorylation the reaction for aerobic respiration is essentially the reverse of photosynthesis and is simplified as c h o o co h o kj molin vertebrates o diffuses through membranes in the lungs and into red blood cells hemoglobin binds o changing color from bluish red to bright red co is released from another part of hemoglobin through the bohr effect other animals use hemocyanin molluscs and some arthropods or hemerythrin spiders and lobsters a liter of blood can dissolve cm of o until the discovery of anaerobic metazoa oxygen was thought to be a requirement for all complex life reactive oxygen species such as superoxide ion o and hydrogen peroxide h o are reactive by products of oxygen use in organisms parts of the immune system of higher organisms create peroxide superoxide and singlet oxygen to destroy invading microbes reactive oxygen species also play an important role in the hypersensitive response of plants against pathogen attack oxygen is damaging to obligately anaerobic organisms which were the dominant form of early life on earth until o began to accumulate in the atmosphere about billion years ago during the great oxygenation event about a billion years after the first appearance of these organisms an adult human at rest inhales to grams of oxygen per minute this amounts to more than billion tonnes of oxygen inhaled by humanity per year living organisms the free oxygen partial pressure in the body of a living vertebrate organism is highest in the respiratory system and decreases along any arterial system peripheral tissues and venous system respectively partial pressure is the pressure that oxygen would have if it alone occupied the volume build up in the atmosphere free oxygen gas was almost nonexistent in earth s atmosphere before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved probably about billion years ago free oxygen first appeared in significant quantities during the paleoproterozoic eon between and billion years ago even if there was much dissolved iron in the oceans when oxygenic photosynthesis was getting more common it appears the banded iron formations were created by anoxyenic or micro aerophilic iron oxidizing bacteria which dominated the deeper areas of the photic zone while oxygen producing cyanobacteria covered the shallows free oxygen began to outgas from the oceans billion years ago reaching of its present level around billion years ago the presence of large amounts of dissolved and free oxygen in the oceans and atmosphere may have driven most of the extant anaerobic organisms to extinction during the great oxygenation event oxygen catastrophe about billion years ago cellular respiration using o enables aerobic organisms to produce much more atp than anaerobic organisms cellular respiration of o occurs in all eukaryotes including all complex multicellular organisms such as plants and animals since the beginning of the cambrian period million years ago atmospheric o levels have fluctuated between and by volume towards the end of the carboniferous period about million years ago atmospheric o levels reached a maximum of by volume which may have contributed to the large size of insects and amphibians at this time variations in atmospheric oxygen concentration have shaped past climates when oxygen declined atmospheric density dropped which in turn increased surface evaporation causing precipitation increases and warmer temperatures at the current rate of photosynthesis it would take about years to regenerate the entire o in the present atmosphere extraterrestrial free oxygen in the field of astrobiology and in the search for extraterrestrial life oxygen is a strong biosignature that said it might not be a definite biosignature being possibly produced abiotically on celestial bodies with processes and conditions such as a peculiar hydrosphere which allow free oxygen like with europa s and ganymede s thin oxygen atmospheres industrial production one hundred million tonnes of o are extracted from air for industrial uses annually by two primary methods the most common method is fractional distillation of liquefied air with n distilling as a vapor while o is left as a liquid the other primary method of producing o is passing a stream of clean dry air through one bed of a pair of identical zeolite molecular sieves which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is to o simultaneously nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen saturated zeolite bed by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it in the reverse direction of flow after a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline this is known as pressure swing adsorption oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non cryogenic technologies see also the related vacuum swing adsorption oxygen gas can also be produced through electrolysis of water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen dc electricity must be used if ac is used the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio a similar method is the electrocatalytic o evolution from oxides and oxoacids chemical catalysts can be used as well such as in chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life support equipment on submarines and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies another air separation method is forcing air to dissolve through ceramic membranes based on zirconium dioxide by either high pressure or an electric current to produce nearly pure o gas storage oxygen storage methods include high pressure oxygen tanks cryogenics and chemical compounds for reasons of economy oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers since one liter of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and c f such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers which stand outside hospitals and other institutions that need large volumes of pure oxygen gas liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and oxy fuel welding and cutting applications medical uptake of o from the air is the essential purpose of respiration so oxygen supplementation is used in medicine treatment not only increases oxygen levels in the patient s blood but has the secondary effect of decreasing resistance to blood flow in many types of diseased lungs easing work load on the heart oxygen therapy is used to treat emphysema pneumonia some heart disorders congestive heart failure some disorders that cause increased pulmonary artery pressure and any disease that impairs the body s ability to take up and use gaseous oxygen treatments are flexible enough to be used in hospitals the patient s home or increasingly by portable devices oxygen tents were once commonly used in oxygen supplementation but have since been replaced mostly by the use of oxygen masks or nasal cannulas hyperbaric high pressure medicine uses special oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of o around the patient and when needed the medical staff carbon monoxide poisoning gas gangrene and decompression sickness the bends are sometimes addressed with this therapy increased o concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive resulting in bubbles of inert gas mostly nitrogen and helium forming in the blood increasing the pressure of o as soon as possible helps to redissolve the bubbles back into the blood so that these excess gasses can be exhaled naturally through the lungs normobaric oxygen administration at the highest available concentration is frequently used as first aid for any diving injury that may involve inert gas bubble formation in the tissues there is epidemiological support for its use from a statistical study of cases recorded in a long term database life support and recreational use an application of o as a low pressure breathing gas is in modern space suits which surround their occupant s body with the breathing gas these devices use nearly pure oxygen at about one third normal pressure resulting in a normal blood partial pressure of o this trade off of higher oxygen concentration for lower pressure is needed to maintain suit flexibility scuba and surface supplied underwater divers and submariners also rely on artificially delivered o submarines submersibles and atmospheric diving suits usually operate at normal atmospheric pressure breathing air is scrubbed of carbon dioxide by chemical extraction and oxygen is replaced to maintain a constant partial pressure ambient pressure divers breathe air or gas mixtures with an oxygen fraction suited to the operating depth pure or nearly pure o use in diving at pressures higher than atmospheric is usually limited to rebreathers or decompression at relatively shallow depths meters depth or less or medical treatment in recompression chambers at pressures up to bar where acute oxygen toxicity can be managed without the risk of drowning deeper diving requires significant dilution of o with other gases such as nitrogen or helium to prevent oxygen toxicity people who climb mountains or fly in non pressurized fixed wing aircraft sometimes have supplemental o supplies pressurized commercial airplanes have an emergency supply of o automatically supplied to the passengers in case of cabin depressurization sudden cabin pressure loss activates chemical oxygen generators above each seat causing oxygen masks to drop pulling on the masks to start the flow of oxygen as cabin safety instructions dictate forces iron filings into the sodium chlorate inside the canister a steady stream of oxygen gas is then produced by the exothermic reaction oxygen as a mild euphoric has a history of recreational use in oxygen bars and in sports oxygen bars are establishments found in the united states since the late s that offer higher than normal o exposure for a minimal fee professional athletes especially in american football sometimes go off field between plays to don oxygen masks to boost performance the pharmacological effect is doubted a placebo effect is a more likely explanation available studies support a performance boost from oxygen enriched mixtures only if it is inhaled during aerobic exercise other recreational uses that do not involve breathing include pyrotechnic applications such as george goble s five second ignition of barbecue grills industrial smelting of iron ore into steel consumes of commercially produced oxygen in this process o is injected through a high pressure lance into molten iron which removes sulfur impurities and excess carbon as the respective oxides so and co the reactions are exothermic so the temperature increases to c another of commercially produced oxygen is used by the chemical industry ethylene is reacted with o to create ethylene oxide which in turn is converted into ethylene glycol the primary feeder material used to manufacture a host of products including antifreeze and polyester polymers the precursors of many plastics and fabrics large quantities of oxygen or air is used in oxy cracking process and for the production of acrylic acid diformyl furane and benzylic acid on the other hand the electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from oxygen is a promising technology to replace the currently used hydroquinone process last but not least catalytic oxidation is used in afterburners to get rid of hazardous gases most of the remaining of commercially produced oxygen is used in medical applications metal cutting and welding as an oxidizer in rocket fuel and in water treatment oxygen is used in oxyacetylene welding burning acetylene with o to produce a very hot flame in this process metal up to cm in thick is first heated with a small oxy acetylene flame and then quickly cut by a large stream of o compounds the oxidation state of oxygen is in almost all known compounds of oxygen the oxidation state is found in a few compounds such as peroxides compounds containing oxygen in other oxidation states are very uncommon superoxides ozonides elemental hypofluorous acid dioxygenyl dioxygen difluoride and oxygen difluoride oxides and other inorganic compounds water h o is an oxide of hydrogen and the most familiar oxygen compound hydrogen atoms are covalently bonded to oxygen in a water molecule but also have an additional attraction about kj mol per hydrogen atom to an adjacent oxygen atom in a separate molecule these hydrogen bonds between water molecules hold them approximately closer than what would be expected in a simple liquid with just van der waals forces due to its electronegativity oxygen forms chemical bonds with almost all other elements to give corresponding oxides the surface of most metals such as aluminium and titanium are oxidized in the presence of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion many oxides of the transition metals are non stoichiometric compounds with slightly less metal than the chemical formula would show for example the mineral feo w stite is written as fe x o displaystyle ce fe x ce o where x is usually around oxygen is present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of carbon dioxide co the earth s crustal rock is composed in large part of oxides of silicon silica sio as found in granite and quartz aluminium aluminium oxide al o in bauxite and corundum iron iron iii oxide fe o in hematite and rust and calcium carbonate in limestone the rest of the earth s crust is also made of oxygen compounds in particular various complex silicates in silicate minerals the earth s mantle of much larger mass than the crust is largely composed of silicates of magnesium and iron water soluble silicates in the form of na sio na sio and na si o are used as detergents and adhesives oxygen also acts as a ligand for transition metals forming transition metal dioxygen complexes which feature metal o this class of compounds includes the heme proteins hemoglobin and myoglobin an exotic and unusual reaction occurs with ptf which oxidizes oxygen to give o ptf dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate organic compounds among the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are where r is an organic group alcohols r oh ethers r o r ketones r co r aldehydes r co h carboxylic acids r cooh esters r coo r acid anhydrides r co o co r and amides r c o nr there are many important organic solvents that contain oxygen including acetone methanol ethanol isopropanol furan thf diethyl ether dioxane ethyl acetate dmf dmso acetic acid and formic acid acetone ch co and phenol c h oh are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are glycerol formaldehyde glutaraldehyde citric acid acetic anhydride and acetamide epoxides are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms the element is similarly found in almost all biomolecules that are important to or generated by life oxygen reacts spontaneously with many organic compounds at or below room temperature in a process called autoxidation most of the organic compounds that contain oxygen are not made by direct action of o organic compounds important in industry and commerce that are made by direct oxidation of a precursor include ethylene oxide and peracetic acid safety and precautions the nfpa standard rates compressed oxygen gas as nonhazardous to health nonflammable and nonreactive but an oxidizer refrigerated liquid oxygen lox is given a health hazard rating of for increased risk of hyperoxia from condensed vapors and for hazards common to cryogenic liquids such as frostbite and all other ratings are the same as the compressed gas form toxicity oxygen gas o can be toxic at elevated partial pressures leading to convulsions and other health problems oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than kilopascals kpa equal to about oxygen composition at standard pressure or times the normal sea level o partial pressure of about kpa this is not a problem except for patients on mechanical ventilators since gas supplied through oxygen masks in medical applications is typically composed of only o by volume about kpa at standard pressure at one time premature babies were placed in incubators containing o rich air but this practice was discontinued after some babies were blinded by the oxygen content being too high breathing pure o in space applications such as in some modern space suits or in early spacecraft such as apollo causes no damage due to the low total pressures used in the case of spacesuits the o partial pressure in the breathing gas is in general about kpa times normal and the resulting o partial pressure in the astronaut s arterial blood is only marginally more than normal sea level o partial pressure oxygen toxicity to the lungs and central nervous system can also occur in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving prolonged breathing of an air mixture with an o partial pressure more than kpa can eventually lead to permanent pulmonary fibrosis exposure to an o partial pressures greater than kpa about atm may lead to convulsions normally fatal for divers acute oxygen toxicity causing seizures its most feared effect for divers can occur by breathing an air mixture with o at m ft or more of depth the same thing can occur by breathing o at only m ft combustion and other hazards highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity an ignition event such as heat or a spark is needed to trigger combustion oxygen is the oxidant not the fuel concentrated o will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically steel pipes and storage vessels used to store and transmit both gaseous and liquid oxygen will act as a fuel and therefore the design and manufacture of o systems requires special training to ensure that ignition sources are minimized the fire that killed the apollo crew in a launch pad test spread so rapidly because the capsule was pressurized with pure o but at slightly more than atmospheric pressure instead of the normal pressure that would be used in a mission liquid oxygen spills if allowed to soak into organic matter such as wood petrochemicals and asphalt can cause these materials to detonate unpredictably on subsequent mechanical impact ,8
Fluorine,F,fluorine is a chemical element with the symbol f and atomic number it is the lightest halogen and exists at standard conditions as a highly toxic pale yellow diatomic gas as the most electronegative element it is extremely reactive as it reacts with all other elements except for the inert gases among the elements fluorine ranks th in universal abundance and th in terrestrial abundance fluorite the primary mineral source of fluorine which gave the element its name was first described in as it was added to metal ores to lower their melting points for smelting the latin verb fluo meaning flow gave the mineral its name proposed as an element in fluorine proved difficult and dangerous to separate from its compounds and several early experimenters died or sustained injuries from their attempts only in did french chemist henri moissan isolate elemental fluorine using low temperature electrolysis a process still employed for modern production industrial production of fluorine gas for uranium enrichment its largest application began during the manhattan project in world war ii owing to the expense of refining pure fluorine most commercial applications use fluorine compounds with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking the rest of the fluorite is converted into corrosive hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides or into cryolite which plays a key role in aluminium refining molecules containing a carbon fluorine bond often have very high chemical and thermal stability their major uses are as refrigerants electrical insulation and cookware and ptfe teflon pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine contain c f bonds the fluoride ion from dissolved fluoride salts inhibits dental cavities and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation global fluorochemical sales amount to more than us billion a year fluorocarbon gases are generally greenhouse gases with global warming potentials to times that of carbon dioxide and sf has the highest global warming potential of any known substance organofluorine compounds often persist in the environment due to the strength of the carbon fluorine bond fluorine has no known metabolic role in mammals a few plants and sea sponges synthesize organofluorine poisons most often monofluoroacetates that help deter predation characteristics electron configuration fluorine atoms have nine electrons one fewer than neon and electron configuration s s p two electrons in a filled inner shell and seven in an outer shell requiring one more to be filled the outer electrons are ineffective at nuclear shielding and experience a high effective nuclear charge of this affects the atom s physical properties fluorine s first ionization energy is third highest among all elements behind helium and neon which complicates the removal of electrons from neutral fluorine atoms it also has a high electron affinity second only to chlorine and tends to capture an electron to become isoelectronic with the noble gas neon it has the highest electronegativity of any element fluorine atoms have a small covalent radius of around picometers similar to those of its period neighbors oxygen and neon reactivity the bond energy of difluorine is much lower than that of either cl or br and similar to the easily cleaved peroxide bond this along with high electronegativity accounts for fluorine s easy dissociation high reactivity and strong bonds to non fluorine atoms conversely bonds to other atoms are very strong because of fluorine s high electronegativity unreactive substances like powdered steel glass fragments and asbestos fibers react quickly with cold fluorine gas wood and water spontaneously combust under a fluorine jet reactions of elemental fluorine with metals require varying conditions alkali metals cause explosions and alkaline earth metals display vigorous activity in bulk to prevent passivation from the formation of metal fluoride layers most other metals such as aluminium and iron must be powdered and noble metals require pure fluorine gas at c f some solid nonmetals sulfur phosphorus react vigorously in liquid fluorine hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide combine readily with fluorine the latter sometimes explosively sulfuric acid exhibits much less activity requiring elevated temperatures hydrogen like some of the alkali metals reacts explosively with fluorine carbon as lamp black reacts at room temperature to yield fluoromethane graphite combines with fluorine above c f to produce non stoichiometric carbon monofluoride higher temperatures generate gaseous fluorocarbons sometimes with explosions carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide react at or just above room temperature whereas paraffins and other organic chemicals generate strong reactions even completely substituted haloalkanes such as carbon tetrachloride normally incombustible may explode although nitrogen trifluoride is stable nitrogen requires an electric discharge at elevated temperatures for reaction with fluorine to occur due to the very strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen ammonia may react explosively oxygen does not combine with fluorine under ambient conditions but can be made to react using electric discharge at low temperatures and pressures the products tend to disintegrate into their constituent elements when heated heavier halogens react readily with fluorine as does the noble gas radon of the other noble gases only xenon and krypton react and only under special conditions phases at room temperature fluorine is a gas of diatomic molecules pale yellow when pure sometimes described as yellow green it has a characteristic halogen like pungent and biting odor detectable at ppb fluorine condenses into a bright yellow liquid at c f a transition temperature similar to those of oxygen and nitrogen fluorine has two solid forms and fluorine the latter crystallizes at c f and is transparent and soft with the same disordered cubic structure of freshly crystallized solid oxygen unlike the orthorhombic systems of other solid halogens further cooling to c f induces a phase transition into opaque and hard fluorine which has a monoclinic structure with dense angled layers of molecules the transition from to fluorine is more exothermic than the condensation of fluorine and can be violent isotopes only one isotope of fluorine occurs naturally in abundance the stable isotope f it has a high magnetogyric ratio and exceptional sensitivity to magnetic fields because it is also the only stable isotope it is used in magnetic resonance imaging eighteen radioisotopes with mass numbers from to have been synthesized of which f is the most stable with a half life of minutes f is a natural trace radioisotope produced by cosmic ray spallation of atmospheric argon as well as by reaction of protons with natural oxygen o p f n other radioisotopes have half lives less than seconds most decay in less than half a second the isotopes f and f undergo decay and electron capture lighter isotopes decay by proton emission and those heavier than f undergo decay the heaviest ones with delayed neutron emission two metastable isomers of fluorine are known mf with a half life of nanoseconds and mf with a half life of milliseconds occurrence universe among the lighter elements fluorine s abundance value of ppb parts per billion th among elements in the universe is exceptionally low other elements from carbon to magnesium are twenty or more times as common this is because stellar nucleosynthesis processes bypass fluorine and any fluorine atoms otherwise created have high nuclear cross sections allowing collisions with hydrogen or helium to generate oxygen or neon respectively beyond this transient existence three explanations have been proposed for the presence of fluorine during type ii supernovae bombardment of neon atoms by neutrinos could transmute them to fluorine the solar wind of wolf rayet stars could blow fluorine away from any hydrogen or helium atoms or fluorine is borne out on convection currents arising from fusion in asymptotic giant branch stars earth fluorine is the thirteenth most common element in earth s crust at ppm parts per million by mass though believed not to occur naturally elemental fluorine has been shown to be present as an occlusion in antozonite a variant of fluorite most fluorine exists as fluoride containing minerals fluorite fluorapatite and cryolite are the most industrially significant fluorite caf also known as fluorspar abundant worldwide is the main source of fluoride and hence fluorine china and mexico are the major suppliers fluorapatite ca po f which contains most of the world s fluoride is an inadvertent source of fluoride as a byproduct of fertilizer production cryolite na alf used in the production of aluminium is the most fluorine rich mineral economically viable natural sources of cryolite have been exhausted and most is now synthesised commercially other minerals such as topaz contain fluorine fluorides unlike other halides are insoluble and do not occur in commercially favorable concentrations in saline waters trace quantities of organofluorines of uncertain origin have been detected in volcanic eruptions and geothermal springs the existence of gaseous fluorine in crystals suggested by the smell of crushed antozonite is contentious a study reported the presence of f by weight in antozonite attributing these inclusions to radiation from the presence of tiny amounts of uranium history early discoveries in georgius agricola described fluorite as an additive used to lower the melting point of metals during smelting he penned the latin word fluor s fluor flow for fluorite rocks the name later evolved into fluorspar still commonly used and then fluorite the composition of fluorite was later determined to be calcium difluoride hydrofluoric acid was used in glass etching from onward andreas sigismund marggraf first characterized it in when he heated fluorite with sulfuric acid and the resulting solution corroded its glass container swedish chemist carl wilhelm scheele repeated the experiment in and named the acidic product fluss spats syran fluorspar acid in the french physicist andr marie amp re suggested that hydrogen and an element analogous to chlorine constituted hydrofluoric acid he also proposed in a letter to sir humphry davy dated august that this then unknown substance may be named fluorine from fluoric acid and the ine suffix of other halogens this word often with modifications is used in most european languages however greek russian and some others following amp re s later suggestion use the name ftor or derivatives from the greek phthorios destructive the new latin name fluorum gave the element its current symbol f fl was used in early papers isolation initial studies on fluorine were so dangerous that several th century experimenters were deemed fluorine martyrs after misfortunes with hydrofluoric acid isolation of elemental fluorine was hindered by the extreme corrosiveness of both elemental fluorine itself and hydrogen fluoride as well as the lack of a simple and suitable electrolyte edmond fr my postulated that electrolysis of pure hydrogen fluoride to generate fluorine was feasible and devised a method to produce anhydrous samples from acidified potassium bifluoride instead he discovered that the resulting dry hydrogen fluoride did not conduct electricity fr my s former student henri moissan persevered and after much trial and error found that a mixture of potassium bifluoride and dry hydrogen fluoride was a conductor enabling electrolysis to prevent rapid corrosion of the platinum in his electrochemical cells he cooled the reaction to extremely low temperatures in a special bath and forged cells from a more resistant mixture of platinum and iridium and used fluorite stoppers in after years of effort by many chemists moissan isolated elemental fluorine in two months before his death moissan received the nobel prize in chemistry with the following citation i n recognition of the great services rendered by him in his investigation and isolation of the element fluorine the whole world has admired the great experimental skill with which you have studied that savage beast among the elements later uses the frigidaire division of general motors gm experimented with chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants in the late s and kinetic chemicals was formed as a joint venture between gm and dupont in hoping to market freon ccl f as one such refrigerant it replaced earlier and more toxic compounds increased demand for kitchen refrigerators and became profitable by dupont had bought out kinetic and marketed several other freon compounds polytetrafluoroethylene teflon was serendipitously discovered in by roy j plunkett while working on refrigerants at kinetic and its superlative chemical and thermal resistance lent it to accelerated commercialization and mass production by large scale production of elemental fluorine began during world war ii germany used high temperature electrolysis to make tons of the planned incendiary chlorine trifluoride and the manhattan project used huge quantities to produce uranium hexafluoride for uranium enrichment since uf is as corrosive as fluorine gaseous diffusion plants required special materials nickel for membranes fluoropolymers for seals and liquid fluorocarbons as coolants and lubricants this burgeoning nuclear industry later drove post war fluorochemical development compounds fluorine has a rich chemistry encompassing organic and inorganic domains it combines with metals nonmetals metalloids and most noble gases and almost exclusively assumes an oxidation state of fluorine s high electron affinity results in a preference for ionic bonding when it forms covalent bonds these are polar and almost always single metals alkali metals form ionic and highly soluble monofluorides these have the cubic arrangement of sodium chloride and analogous chlorides alkaline earth difluorides possess strong ionic bonds but are insoluble in water with the exception of beryllium difluoride which also exhibits some covalent character and has a quartz like structure rare earth elements and many other metals form mostly ionic trifluorides covalent bonding first comes to prominence in the tetrafluorides those of zirconium hafnium and several actinides are ionic with high melting points while those of titanium vanadium and niobium are polymeric melting or decomposing at no more than c f pentafluorides continue this trend with their linear polymers and oligomeric complexes thirteen metal hexafluorides are known all octahedral and are mostly volatile solids but for liquid mof and ref and gaseous wf rhenium heptafluoride the only characterized metal heptafluoride is a low melting molecular solid with pentagonal bipyramidal molecular geometry metal fluorides with more fluorine atoms are particularly reactive hydrogen hydrogen and fluorine combine to yield hydrogen fluoride in which discrete molecules form clusters by hydrogen bonding resembling water more than hydrogen chloride it boils at a much higher temperature than heavier hydrogen halides and unlike them is miscible with water hydrogen fluoride readily hydrates on contact with water to form aqueous hydrogen fluoride also known as hydrofluoric acid unlike the other hydrohalic acids which are strong hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid at low concentrations however it can attack glass something the other acids cannot do other reactive nonmetals binary fluorides of metalloids and p block nonmetals are generally covalent and volatile with varying reactivities period and heavier nonmetals can form hypervalent fluorides boron trifluoride is planar and possesses an incomplete octet it functions as a lewis acid and combines with lewis bases like ammonia to form adducts carbon tetrafluoride is tetrahedral and inert its group analogues silicon and germanium tetrafluoride are also tetrahedral but behave as lewis acids the pnictogens form trifluorides that increase in reactivity and basicity with higher molecular weight although nitrogen trifluoride resists hydrolysis and is not basic the pentafluorides of phosphorus arsenic and antimony are more reactive than their respective trifluorides with antimony pentafluoride the strongest neutral lewis acid known chalcogens have diverse fluorides unstable difluorides have been reported for oxygen the only known compound with oxygen in an oxidation state of sulfur and selenium tetrafluorides and hexafluorides exist for sulfur selenium and tellurium the latter are stabilized by more fluorine atoms and lighter central atoms so sulfur hexafluoride is especially inert chlorine bromine and iodine can each form mono tri and pentafluorides but only iodine heptafluoride has been characterized among possible interhalogen heptafluorides many of them are powerful sources of fluorine atoms and industrial applications using chlorine trifluoride require precautions similar to those using fluorine noble gases noble gases having complete electron shells defied reaction with other elements until when neil bartlett reported synthesis of xenon hexafluoroplatinate xenon difluoride tetrafluoride hexafluoride and multiple oxyfluorides have been isolated since then among other noble gases krypton forms a difluoride and radon and fluorine generate a solid suspected to be radon difluoride binary fluorides of lighter noble gases are exceptionally unstable argon and hydrogen fluoride combine under extreme conditions to give argon fluorohydride helium and neon have no long lived fluorides and no neon fluoride has ever been observed helium fluorohydride has been detected for milliseconds at high pressures and low temperatures organic compounds the carbon fluorine bond is organic chemistry s strongest and gives stability to organofluorines it is almost non existent in nature but is used in artificial compounds research in this area is usually driven by commercial applications the compounds involved are diverse and reflect the complexity inherent in organic chemistry discrete molecules the substitution of hydrogen atoms in an alkane by progressively more fluorine atoms gradually alters several properties melting and boiling points are lowered density increases solubility in hydrocarbons decreases and overall stability increases perfluorocarbons in which all hydrogen atoms are substituted are insoluble in most organic solvents reacting at ambient conditions only with sodium in liquid ammonia the term perfluorinated compound is used for what would otherwise be a perfluorocarbon if not for the presence of a functional group often a carboxylic acid these compounds share many properties with perfluorocarbons such as stability and hydrophobicity while the functional group augments their reactivity enabling them to adhere to surfaces or act as surfactants fluorosurfactants in particular can lower the surface tension of water more than their hydrocarbon based analogues fluorotelomers which have some unfluorinated carbon atoms near the functional group are also regarded as perfluorinated polymers polymers exhibit the same stability increases afforded by fluorine substitution for hydrogen in discrete molecules their melting points generally increase too polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe the simplest fluoropolymer and perfluoro analogue of polyethylene with structural unit cf demonstrates this change as expected but its very high melting point makes it difficult to mold various ptfe derivatives are less temperature tolerant but easier to mold fluorinated ethylene propylene replaces some fluorine atoms with trifluoromethyl groups perfluoroalkoxy alkanes do the same with trifluoromethoxy groups and nafion contains perfluoroether side chains capped with sulfonic acid groups other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms polyvinylidene fluoride has half the fluorine atoms of ptfe and polyvinyl fluoride has a quarter but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers production elemental fluorine and virtually all fluorine compounds are produced from hydrogen fluoride or its aqueous solutions hydrofluoric acid hydrogen fluoride is produced in kilns by the endothermic reaction of fluorite caf with sulfuric acid caf h so hf g caso the gaseous hf can then be absorbed in water or liquefied about of manufactured hf is a byproduct of fertilizer production which produces hexafluorosilicic acid h sif which can be degraded to release hf thermally and by hydrolysis h sif hf sif sif h o hf sio industrial routes to f moissan s method is used to produce industrial quantities of fluorine via the electrolysis of a potassium fluoride hydrogen fluoride mixture hydrogen and fluoride ions are reduced and oxidized at a steel container cathode and a carbon block anode under volts to generate hydrogen and fluorine gas respectively temperatures are elevated kf hf melting at c f and being electrolyzed at c f kf which acts to provide electrical conductivity is essential since pure hf cannot be electrolyzed because it is virtually non conductive fluorine can be stored in steel cylinders that have passivated interiors at temperatures below c f otherwise nickel can be used regulator valves and pipework are made of nickel the latter possibly using monel instead frequent passivation along with the strict exclusion of water and greases must be undertaken in the laboratory glassware may carry fluorine gas under low pressure and anhydrous conditions some sources instead recommend nickel monel ptfe systems laboratory routes while preparing for a conference to celebrate the centennial of moissan s achievement karl o christe reasoned that chemical fluorine generation should be feasible since some metal fluoride anions have no stable neutral counterparts their acidification potentially triggers oxidation instead he devised a method which evolves fluorine at high yield and atmospheric pressure kmno kf hf h o k mnf h o o k mnf sbf ksbf mnf f christe later commented that the reactants had been known for more than years and even moissan could have come up with this scheme as late as some references still asserted that fluorine was too reactive for any chemical isolation industrial applications fluorite mining which supplies most global fluorine peaked in when million metric tons of ore were extracted chlorofluorocarbon restrictions lowered this to million tons in production has since been increasing around million tons of ore and revenue of us million were generated in later reports estimated global fluorochemical sales at billion and predicted production figures of to million tons and revenue of at least billion froth flotation separates mined fluorite into two main metallurgical grades of equal proportion pure metspar is almost all used in iron smelting whereas pure acidspar is mainly converted to the key industrial intermediate hydrogen fluoride at least metric tons of fluorine are produced each year it costs only per kilogram as uranium or sulfur hexafluoride but many times more as an element because of handling challenges most processes using free fluorine in large amounts employ in situ generation under vertical integration the largest application of fluorine gas consuming up to metric tons annually is in the preparation of uf for the nuclear fuel cycle fluorine is used to fluorinate uranium tetrafluoride itself formed from uranium dioxide and hydrofluoric acid fluorine is monoisotopic so any mass differences between uf molecules are due to the presence of u or u enabling uranium enrichment via gaseous diffusion or gas centrifuge about metric tons per year go into producing the inert dielectric sf for high voltage transformers and circuit breakers eliminating the need for hazardous polychlorinated biphenyls associated with oil filled devices several fluorine compounds are used in electronics rhenium and tungsten hexafluoride in chemical vapor deposition tetrafluoromethane in plasma etching and nitrogen trifluoride in cleaning equipment fluorine is also used in the synthesis of organic fluorides but its reactivity often necessitates conversion first to the gentler clf brf or if which together allow calibrated fluorination fluorinated pharmaceuticals use sulfur tetrafluoride instead inorganic fluorides as with other iron alloys around kg lb metspar is added to each metric ton of steel the fluoride ions lower its melting point and viscosity alongside its role as an additive in materials like enamels and welding rod coats most acidspar is reacted with sulfuric acid to form hydrofluoric acid which is used in steel pickling glass etching and alkane cracking one third of hf goes into synthesizing cryolite and aluminium trifluoride both fluxes in the hall h roult process for aluminium extraction replenishment is necessitated by their occasional reactions with the smelting apparatus each metric ton of aluminium requires about kg lb of flux fluorosilicates consume the second largest portion with sodium fluorosilicate used in water fluoridation and laundry effluent treatment and as an intermediate en route to cryolite and silicon tetrafluoride other important inorganic fluorides include those of cobalt nickel and ammonium organic fluorides organofluorides consume over of mined fluorite and over of hydrofluoric acid with refrigerant gases dominating and fluoropolymers increasing their market share surfactants are a minor application but generate over billion in annual revenue due to the danger from direct hydrocarbon fluorine reactions above c f industrial fluorocarbon production is indirect mostly through halogen exchange reactions such as swarts fluorination in which chlorocarbon chlorines are substituted for fluorines by hydrogen fluoride under catalysts electrochemical fluorination subjects hydrocarbons to electrolysis in hydrogen fluoride and the fowler process treats them with solid fluorine carriers like cobalt trifluoride refrigerant gases halogenated refrigerants termed freons in informal contexts are identified by r numbers that denote the amount of fluorine chlorine carbon and hydrogen present chlorofluorocarbons cfcs like r r and r once dominated organofluorines peaking in production in the s used for air conditioning systems propellants and solvents their production was below one tenth of this peak by the early s after widespread international prohibition hydrochlorofluorocarbons hcfcs and hydrofluorocarbons hfcs were designed as replacements their synthesis consumes more than of the fluorine in the organic industry important hcfcs include r chlorodifluoromethane and r b the main hfc is r a with a new type of molecule hfo yf a hydrofluoroolefin hfo coming to prominence owing to its global warming potential of less than that of hfc a polymers about metric tons of fluoropolymers were produced in and generating over billion revenue per year the global market was estimated at just under billion in and was predicted to grow by per year up to fluoropolymers can only be formed by polymerizing free radicals polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe sometimes called by its dupont name teflon represents by mass of the world s fluoropolymer production the largest application is in electrical insulation since ptfe is an excellent dielectric it is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed in coating pipes tubing and gaskets another major use is in pfte coated fiberglass cloth for stadium roofs the major consumer application is for non stick cookware jerked ptfe film becomes expanded ptfe eptfe a fine pored membrane sometimes referred to by the brand name gore tex and used for rainwear protective apparel and filters eptfe fibers may be made into seals and dust filters other fluoropolymers including fluorinated ethylene propylene mimic ptfe s properties and can substitute for it they are more moldable but also more costly and have lower thermal stability films from two different fluoropolymers replace glass in solar cells the chemically resistant but expensive fluorinated ionomers are used as electrochemical cell membranes of which the first and most prominent example is nafion developed in the s it was initially deployed as fuel cell material in spacecraft and then replaced mercury based chloralkali process cells recently the fuel cell application has reemerged with efforts to install proton exchange membrane fuel cells into automobiles fluoroelastomers such as viton are crosslinked fluoropolymer mixtures mainly used in o rings perfluorobutane c f is used as a fire extinguishing agent surfactants fluorosurfactants are small organofluorine molecules used for repelling water and stains although expensive comparable to pharmaceuticals at per kilogram they yielded over billion in annual revenues by scotchgard alone generated over million in fluorosurfactants are a minority in the overall surfactant market most of which is taken up by much cheaper hydrocarbon based products applications in paints are burdened by compounding costs this use was valued at only million in agrichemicals about of agrichemicals contain fluorine most of them herbicides and fungicides with a few crop regulators fluorine substitution usually of a single atom or at most a trifluoromethyl group is a robust modification with effects analogous to fluorinated pharmaceuticals increased biological stay time membrane crossing and altering of molecular recognition trifluralin is a prominent example with large scale use in the u s as a weedkiller but it is a suspected carcinogen and has been banned in many european countries sodium monofluoroacetate is a mammalian poison in which two acetic acid hydrogens are replaced with fluorine and sodium it disrupts cell metabolism by replacing acetate in the citric acid cycle first synthesized in the late th century it was recognized as an insecticide in the early th and was later deployed in its current use new zealand the largest consumer of uses it to protect kiwis from the invasive australian common brushtail possum europe and the u s have banned medicinal applications dental care population studies from the mid th century onwards show topical fluoride reduces dental caries this was first attributed to the conversion of tooth enamel hydroxyapatite into the more durable fluorapatite but studies on pre fluoridated teeth refuted this hypothesis and current theories involve fluoride aiding enamel growth in small caries after studies of children in areas where fluoride was naturally present in drinking water controlled public water supply fluoridation to fight tooth decay began in the s and is now applied to water supplying percent of the global population including two thirds of americans reviews of the scholarly literature in and associated water fluoridation with a significant reduction of tooth decay in children despite such endorsements and evidence of no adverse effects other than mostly benign dental fluorosis opposition still exists on ethical and safety grounds the benefits of fluoridation have lessened possibly due to other fluoride sources but are still measurable in low income groups sodium monofluorophosphate and sometimes sodium or tin ii fluoride are often found in fluoride toothpastes first introduced in the u s in and now ubiquitous in developed countries alongside fluoridated mouthwashes gels foams and varnishes pharmaceuticals twenty percent of modern pharmaceuticals contain fluorine one of these the cholesterol reducer atorvastatin lipitor made more revenue than any other drug until it became generic in the combination asthma prescription seretide a top ten revenue drug in the mid s contains two active ingredients one of which fluticasone is fluorinated many drugs are fluorinated to delay inactivation and lengthen dosage periods because the carbon fluorine bond is very stable fluorination also increases lipophilicity because the bond is more hydrophobic than the carbon hydrogen bond and this often helps in cell membrane penetration and hence bioavailability tricyclics and other pre s antidepressants had several side effects due to their non selective interference with neurotransmitters other than the serotonin target the fluorinated fluoxetine was selective and one of the first to avoid this problem many current antidepressants receive this same treatment including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors citalopram its isomer escitalopram and fluvoxamine and paroxetine quinolones are artificial broad spectrum antibiotics that are often fluorinated to enhance their effects these include ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin fluorine also finds use in steroids fludrocortisone is a blood pressure raising mineralocorticoid and triamcinolone and dexamethasone are strong glucocorticoids the majority of inhaled anesthetics are heavily fluorinated the prototype halothane is much more inert and potent than its contemporaries later compounds such as the fluorinated ethers sevoflurane and desflurane are better than halothane and are almost insoluble in blood allowing faster waking times pet scanning fluorine is often found in radioactive tracers for positron emission tomography as its half life of almost two hours is long enough to allow for its transport from production facilities to imaging centers the most common tracer is fluorodeoxyglucose which after intravenous injection is taken up by glucose requiring tissues such as the brain and most malignant tumors computer assisted tomography can then be used for detailed imaging oxygen carriers liquid fluorocarbons can hold large volumes of oxygen or carbon dioxide more so than blood and have attracted attention for their possible uses in artificial blood and in liquid breathing because fluorocarbons do not normally mix with water they must be mixed into emulsions small droplets of perfluorocarbon suspended in water to be used as blood one such product oxycyte has been through initial clinical trials these substances can aid endurance athletes and are banned from sports one cyclist s near death in prompted an investigation into their abuse applications of pure perfluorocarbon liquid breathing which uses pure perfluorocarbon liquid not a water emulsion include assisting burn victims and premature babies with deficient lungs partial and complete lung filling have been considered though only the former has had any significant tests in humans an alliance pharmaceuticals effort reached clinical trials but was abandoned because the results were not better than normal therapies biological role fluorine is not essential for humans and other mammals but small amounts are known to be beneficial for the strengthening of dental enamel where the formation of fluorapatite makes the enamel more resistant to attack from acids produced by bacterial fermentation of sugars small amounts of fluorine may be beneficial for bone strength but the latter has not been definitively established both the who and the institute of medicine of the us national academies publish recommended daily allowance rda and upper tolerated intake of fluorine which varies with age and gender natural organofluorines have been found in microorganisms and plants but not animals the most common is fluoroacetate which is used as a defense against herbivores by at least plants in africa australia and brazil other examples include terminally fluorinated fatty acids fluoroacetone and fluorocitrate an enzyme that binds fluorine to carbon adenosyl fluoride synthase was discovered in bacteria in toxicity elemental fluorine is highly toxic to living organisms its effects in humans start at concentrations lower than hydrogen cyanide s ppm and are similar to those of chlorine significant irritation of the eyes and respiratory system as well as liver and kidney damage occur above ppm which is the immediately dangerous to life and health value for fluorine the eyes and nose are seriously damaged at ppm and inhalation of ppm fluorine will cause death in minutes compared to ppm for hydrogen cyanide hydrofluoric acid hydrofluoric acid is the weakest of the hydrohalic acids having a pka of at c it is a volatile liquid due to the presence of hydrogen bonding while the other hydrohalic acids are gases it is able to attack glass concrete metals organic matter hydrofluoric acid is a contact poison with greater hazards than many strong acids like sulfuric acid even though it is weak it remains neutral in aqueous solution and thus penetrates tissue faster whether through inhalation ingestion or the skin and at least nine u s workers died in such accidents from to it reacts with calcium and magnesium in the blood leading to hypocalcemia and possible death through cardiac arrhythmia insoluble calcium fluoride formation triggers strong pain and burns larger than cm in can cause serious systemic toxicity exposure may not be evident for eight hours for hf rising to hours for lower concentrations and a burn may initially be painless as hydrogen fluoride affects nerve function if skin has been exposed to hf damage can be reduced by rinsing it under a jet of water for minutes and removing contaminated clothing calcium gluconate is often applied next providing calcium ions to bind with fluoride skin burns can be treated with calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions hydrofluoric acid absorption requires further medical treatment calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously using calcium chloride a common laboratory reagent in lieu of calcium gluconate is contraindicated and may lead to severe complications excision or amputation of affected parts may be required fluoride ion soluble fluorides are moderately toxic g sodium fluoride or mg fluoride ions per kilogram of body mass represents a lethal dose for adults one fifth of the lethal dose can cause adverse health effects and chronic excess consumption may lead to skeletal fluorosis which affects millions in asia and africa ingested fluoride forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach which is easily absorbed by the intestines where it crosses cell membranes binds with calcium and interferes with various enzymes before urinary excretion exposure limits are determined by urine testing of the body s ability to clear fluoride ions historically most cases of fluoride poisoning have been caused by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluorides most current calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride containing toothpaste malfunctioning water fluoridation equipment is another cause one incident in alaska affected almost people and killed one person dangers from toothpaste are aggravated for small children and the centers for disease control and prevention recommends supervising children below six brushing their teeth so that they do not swallow toothpaste one regional study examined a year of pre teen fluoride poisoning reports totaling cases including one death from ingesting insecticide most had no symptoms but about had stomach pains a larger study across the u s had similar findings of cases involved children under six

review showed a slight correlation between groundwater and soil pfaa levels and human activity there was no clear pattern of one chemical dominating and higher amounts of pfos were correlated to higher amounts of pfoa in the body pfaas bind to proteins such as serum albumin they tend to concentrate within humans in the liver and blood before excretion through the kidneys dwell time in the body varies greatly by species with half lives of days in rodents and years in humans high doses of pfos and pfoa cause cancer and death in newborn rodents but human studies have not established an

Neon,Ne,neon is a chemical element with the symbol ne and atomic number it is a noble gas neon is a colorless odorless inert monatomic gas under standard conditions with about two thirds the density of air it was discovered along with krypton and xenon in as one of the three residual rare inert elements remaining in dry air after nitrogen oxygen argon and carbon dioxide were removed neon was the second of these three rare gases to be discovered and was immediately recognized as a new element from its bright red emission spectrum the name neon is derived from the greek word neuter singular form of neos meaning new neon is chemically inert and no uncharged neon compounds are known the compounds of neon currently known include ionic molecules molecules held together by van der waals forces and clathrates during cosmic nucleogenesis of the elements large amounts of neon are built up from the alpha capture fusion process in stars although neon is a very common element in the universe and solar system it is fifth in cosmic abundance after hydrogen helium oxygen and carbon it is rare on earth it composes about ppm of air by volume this is about the same as the molecular or mole fraction and a smaller fraction in earth s crust the reason for neon s relative scarcity on earth and the inner terrestrial planets is that neon is highly volatile and forms no compounds to fix it to solids as a result it escaped from the planetesimals under the warmth of the newly ignited sun in the early solar system even the outer atmosphere of jupiter is somewhat depleted of neon although for a different reason neon gives a distinct reddish orange glow when used in low voltage neon glow lamps high voltage discharge tubes and neon advertising signs the red emission line from neon also causes the well known red light of helium neon lasers neon is used in some plasma tube and refrigerant applications but has few other commercial uses it is commercially extracted by the fractional distillation of liquid air since air is the only source it is considerably more expensive than helium history neon was discovered in by the british chemists sir william ramsay and morris travers in london neon was discovered when ramsay chilled a sample of air until it became a liquid then warmed the liquid and captured the gases as they boiled off the gases nitrogen oxygen and argon had been identified but the remaining gases were isolated in roughly their order of abundance in a six week period beginning at the end of may first to be identified was krypton the next after krypton had been removed was a gas which gave a brilliant red light under spectroscopic discharge this gas identified in june was named neon the greek analogue of the latin novum new suggested by ramsay s son the characteristic brilliant red orange color emitted by gaseous neon when excited electrically was noted immediately travers later wrote the blaze of crimson light from the tube told its own story and was a sight to dwell upon and never forget a second gas was also reported along with neon having approximately the same density as argon but with a different spectrum ramsay and travers named it metargon however subsequent spectroscopic analysis revealed it to be argon contaminated with carbon monoxide finally the same team discovered xenon by the same process in september neon s scarcity precluded its prompt application for lighting along the lines of moore tubes which used nitrogen and which were commercialized in the early s after georges claude s company air liquide produced industrial quantities of neon as a byproduct of his air liquefaction business in december claude demonstrated modern neon lighting based on a sealed tube of neon claude tried briefly to sell neon tubes for indoor domestic lighting due to their intensity but the market failed because homeowners objected to the color in claude s associate began selling neon discharge tubes as eye catching advertising signs and was instantly more successful neon tubes were introduced to the u s in with two large neon signs bought by a los angeles packard car dealership the glow and arresting red color made neon advertising completely different from the competition the intense color and vibrancy of neon equated with american society at the time suggesting a century of progress and transforming cities into sensational new environments filled with radiating advertisements and electro graphic architecture neon played a role in the basic understanding of the nature of atoms in when j j thomson as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays channeled streams of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field and measured the deflection of the streams with a photographic plate thomson observed two separate patches of light on the photographic plate see image which suggested two different parabolas of deflection thomson eventually concluded that some of the atoms in the neon gas were of higher mass than the rest though not understood at the time by thomson this was the first discovery of isotopes of stable atoms thomson s device was a crude version of the instrument we now term a mass spectrometer isotopes neon has three stable isotopes ne ne and ne ne and ne are partly primordial and partly nucleogenic i e made by nuclear reactions of other nuclides with neutrons or other particles in the environment and their variations in natural abundance are well understood in contrast ne the chief primordial isotope made in stellar nucleosynthesis is not known to be nucleogenic or radiogenic the causes of the variation of ne in the earth have thus been hotly debated the principal nuclear reactions generating nucleogenic neon isotopes start from mg and mg which produce ne and ne respectively after neutron capture and immediate emission of an alpha particle the neutrons that produce the reactions are mostly produced by secondary spallation reactions from alpha particles in turn derived from uranium series decay chains the net result yields a trend towards lower ne ne and higher ne ne ratios observed in uranium rich rocks such as granites in addition isotopic analysis of exposed terrestrial rocks has demonstrated the cosmogenic cosmic ray production of ne this isotope is generated by spallation reactions on magnesium sodium silicon and aluminium by analyzing all three isotopes the cosmogenic component can be resolved from magmatic neon and nucleogenic neon this suggests that neon will be a useful tool in determining cosmic exposure ages of surface rocks and meteorites neon in solar wind contains a higher proportion of ne than nucleogenic and cosmogenic sources neon content observed in samples of volcanic gases and diamonds is also enriched in ne suggesting a primordial possibly solar origin characteristics neon is the second lightest noble gas after helium it glows reddish orange in a vacuum discharge tube it has over times the refrigerating capacity per unit volume of liquid helium and three times that of liquid hydrogen in most applications it is a less expensive refrigerant than helium neon plasma has the most intense light discharge at normal voltages and currents of all the noble gases the average color of this light to the human eye is red orange due to many lines in this range it also contains a strong green line which is hidden unless the visual components are dispersed by a spectroscope two quite different kinds of neon lighting are in common use neon glow lamps are generally tiny with most operating between and volts they have been widely used as power on indicators and in circuit testing equipment but light emitting diodes leds now dominate in those applications these simple neon devices were the forerunners of plasma displays and plasma television screens neon signs typically operate at much higher voltages kilovolts and the luminous tubes are commonly meters long the glass tubing is often formed into shapes and letters for signage as well as architectural and artistic applications occurrence stable isotopes of neon are produced in stars neon s most abundant isotope ne is created by the nuclear fusion of carbon and carbon in the carbon burning process of stellar nucleosynthesis this requires temperatures above megakelvins which occur in the cores of stars of more than solar masses neon is abundant on a universal scale it is the fifth most abundant chemical element in the universe by mass after hydrogen helium oxygen and carbon see chemical element its relative rarity on earth like that of helium is due to its relative lightness high vapor pressure at very low temperatures and chemical inertness all properties which tend to keep it from being trapped in the condensing gas and dust clouds that formed the smaller and warmer solid planets like earth neon is monatomic making it lighter than the molecules of diatomic nitrogen and oxygen which form the bulk of earth s atmosphere a balloon filled with neon will rise in air albeit more slowly than a helium balloon neon s abundance in the universe is about part in in the sun and presumably in the proto solar system nebula about part in the galileo spacecraft atmospheric entry probe found that even in the upper atmosphere of jupiter the abundance of neon is reduced depleted by about a factor of to a level of part in by mass this may indicate that even the ice planetesimals which brought neon into jupiter from the outer solar system formed in a region which was too warm to retain the neon atmospheric component abundances of heavier inert gases on jupiter are several times that found in the sun neon comprises part in in the earth s atmosphere or ppm by volume this is about the same as the molecule or mole fraction or part in of air by mass it comprises a smaller fraction in the crust it is industrially produced by cryogenic fractional distillation of liquefied air on august based on studies with the lunar atmosphere and dust environment explorer ladee spacecraft nasa scientists reported the detection of neon in the exosphere of the moon chemistry neon is the first p block noble gas and the first element with a true octet of electrons it is inert as is the case with its lighter analogue helium no strongly bound neutral molecules containing neon have been identified the ions near neh and hene have been observed from optical and mass spectrometric studies solid neon clathrate hydrate was produced from water ice and neon gas at pressures mpa and temperatures about c ne atoms are not bonded to water and can freely move through this material they can be extracted by placing the clathrate into a vacuum chamber for several days yielding ice xvi the least dense crystalline form of water the familiar pauling electronegativity scale relies upon chemical bond energies but such values have obviously not been measured for inert helium and neon the allen electronegativity scale which relies only upon measurable atomic energies identifies neon as the most electronegative element closely followed by fluorine and helium the triple point temperature of neon k is a defining fixed point in the international temperature scale of production neon is produced from air in cryogenic air separation plants a gas phase mixture mainly of nitrogen neon and helium is withdrawn from the main condenser at the top of the high pressure air separation column and fed to the bottom of a side column for rectification of the neon it can then be further purified from helium about of global neon supply is produced in ukraine as a by product of steel production in russia as of the company iceblick with plants in odessa and moscow supplies per cent of the world s production of neon as well as of the krypton and xenon shortage global neon prices jumped by about after the russian annexation of crimea spurring some chip manufacturers to start shifting away from russian and ukrainian suppliers and toward suppliers in china the russian invasion of ukraine also shut down two companies in ukraine llc cryoin engineering ukrainian and llc inhaz ukrainian located in odessa and mariupol respectively that produced about half of the global supply the closure was predicted to likely exacerbate covid chip shortage which may further shift neon production to china applications neon is often used in signs and produces an unmistakable bright reddish orange light although tube lights with other colors are often called neon they use different noble gases or varied colors of fluorescent lighting neon is used in vacuum tubes high voltage indicators lightning arresters wavemeter tubes television tubes and helium neon lasers liquefied neon is commercially used as a cryogenic refrigerant in applications not requiring the lower temperature range attainable with more extreme liquid helium refrigeration neon as liquid or gas is relatively expensive for small quantities the price of liquid neon can be more than times that of liquid helium driving neon s expense is the rarity of neon which unlike helium can only be obtained in usable quantities by filtering it out of the atmosphere semiconductor industry as of gas mixtures that include neon are used to power lasers for euv lithography ,10
Sodium,Na,sodium is a chemical element with the symbol na from latin natrium and atomic number it is a soft silvery white highly reactive metal sodium is an alkali metal being in group of the periodic table its only stable isotope is na the free metal does not occur in nature and must be prepared from compounds sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the earth s crust and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars sodalite and halite nacl many salts of sodium are highly water soluble sodium ions have been leached by the action of water from the earth s minerals over eons and thus sodium and chlorine are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans sodium was first isolated by humphry davy in by the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide among many other useful sodium compounds sodium hydroxide lye is used in soap manufacture and sodium chloride edible salt is a de icing agent and a nutrient for animals including humans sodium is an essential element for all animals and some plants sodium ions are the major cation in the extracellular fluid ecf and as such are the major contributor to the ecf osmotic pressure and ecf compartment volume loss of water from the ecf compartment increases the sodium concentration a condition called hypernatremia isotonic loss of water and sodium from the ecf compartment decreases the size of that compartment in a condition called ecf hypovolemia by means of the sodium potassium pump living human cells pump three sodium ions out of the cell in exchange for two potassium ions pumped in comparing ion concentrations across the cell membrane inside to outside potassium measures about and sodium about in nerve cells the electrical charge across the cell membrane enables transmission of the nerve impulse an action potential when the charge is dissipated sodium plays a key role in that activity characteristics physical sodium at standard temperature and pressure is a soft silvery metal that combines with oxygen in the air and forms grayish white sodium oxide unless immersed in oil or inert gas which are the conditions it is usually stored in sodium metal can be easily cut with a knife and is a good conductor of electricity and heat because it has only one electron in its valence shell resulting in weak metallic bonding and free electrons which carry energy due to having low atomic mass and large atomic radius sodium is third least dense of all elemental metals and is one of only three metals that can float on water the other two being lithium and potassium the melting c and boiling c points of sodium are lower than those of lithium but higher than those of the heavier alkali metals potassium rubidium and caesium following periodic trends down the group these properties change dramatically at elevated pressures at mbar the color changes from silvery metallic to black at mbar the material becomes transparent with a red color and at mbar sodium is a clear and transparent solid all of these high pressure allotropes are insulators and electrides in a flame test sodium and its compounds glow yellow because the excited s electrons of sodium emit a photon when they fall from p to s the wavelength of this photon corresponds to the d line at about nm spin orbit interactions involving the electron in the p orbital split the d line into two at and nm hyperfine structures involving both orbitals cause many more lines isotopes twenty isotopes of sodium are known but only na is stable na is created in the carbon burning process in stars by fusing two carbon atoms together this requires temperatures above megakelvins and a star of at least three solar masses two radioactive cosmogenic isotopes are the byproduct of cosmic ray spallation na has a half life of years and na a half life of hours all other isotopes have a half life of less than one minute two nuclear isomers have been discovered the longer lived one being mna with a half life of around milliseconds acute neutron radiation as from a nuclear criticality accident converts some of the stable na in human blood to na the neutron radiation dosage of a victim can be calculated by measuring the concentration of na relative to na chemistry sodium atoms have electrons one more than the stable configuration of the noble gas neon the first and second ionization energies are kj mol and kj mol respectively as a result sodium usually forms ionic compounds involving the na cation metallic sodium metallic sodium is generally less reactive than potassium and more reactive than lithium sodium metal is highly reducing with the standard reduction potential for the na na couple being volts though potassium and lithium have even more negative potentials the thermal fluidic chemical and nuclear properties of molten sodium metal have caused it to be one of the main coolants of choice for the fast breeder reactor such nuclear reactors are seen as a crucial step for the production of clean energy salts and oxides sodium compounds are of immense commercial importance being particularly central to industries producing glass paper soap and textiles the most important sodium compounds are table salt nacl soda ash na co baking soda nahco caustic soda naoh sodium nitrate nano di and tri sodium phosphates sodium thiosulfate na s o h o and borax na b o h o in compounds sodium is usually ionically bonded to water and anions and is viewed as a hard lewis acid most soaps are sodium salts of fatty acids sodium soaps have a higher melting temperature and seem harder than potassium soaps sodium containing mixed oxides are promising catalysts and photocatalysts photochemically intercalated sodium ion enhances the photoelectrocatalytic activity of wo like all the alkali metals sodium reacts exothermically with water the reaction produces caustic soda sodium hydroxide and flammable hydrogen gas when burned in air it forms primarily sodium peroxide with some sodium oxide aqueous solutions sodium tends to form water soluble compounds such as halides sulfates nitrates carboxylates and carbonates the main aqueous species are the aquo complexes na h o n where n with n indicated from x ray diffraction data and computer simulations direct precipitation of sodium salts from aqueous solutions is rare because sodium salts typically have a high affinity for water an exception is sodium bismuthate nabio because of the high solubility of its compounds sodium salts are usually isolated as solids by evaporation or by precipitation with an organic antisolvent such as ethanol for example only g l of sodium chloride will dissolve in ethanol crown ethers like crown may be used as a phase transfer catalyst sodium content of samples is determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry or by potentiometry using ion selective electrodes electrides and sodides like the other alkali metals sodium dissolves in ammonia and some amines to give deeply colored solutions evaporation of these solutions leaves a shiny film of metallic sodium the solutions contain the coordination complex na nh with the positive charge counterbalanced by electrons as anions cryptands permit the isolation of these complexes as crystalline solids sodium forms complexes with crown ethers cryptands and other ligands for example crown has a high affinity for sodium because the cavity size of crown is which is enough to fit the sodium ion cryptands like crown ethers and other ionophores also have a high affinity for the sodium ion derivatives of the alkalide na are obtainable by the addition of cryptands to solutions of sodium in ammonia via disproportionation organosodium compounds many organosodium compounds have been prepared because of the high polarity of the c na bonds they behave like sources of carbanions salts with organic anions some well known derivatives include sodium cyclopentadienide nac h and trityl sodium c h cna sodium naphthalene na c h a strong reducing agent forms upon mixing na and naphthalene in ethereal solutions intermetallic compounds sodium forms alloys with many metals such as potassium calcium lead and the group and elements sodium and potassium form kna and nak nak is potassium and it is liquid at ambient temperature it is an excellent thermal and electrical conductor sodium calcium alloys are by products of the electrolytic production of sodium from a binary salt mixture of nacl cacl and ternary mixture nacl cacl bacl calcium is only partially miscible with sodium and the of it dissolved in the sodium obtained from said mixtures can be precipitated by cooling to c and filtering in a liquid state sodium is completely miscible with lead there are several methods to make sodium lead alloys one is to melt them together and another is to deposit sodium electrolytically on molten lead cathodes napb napb na pb na pb and na pb are some of the known sodium lead alloys sodium also forms alloys with gold naau and silver naag group metals zinc cadmium and mercury are known to make alloys with sodium nazn and nacd are alloys of zinc and cadmium sodium and mercury form nahg nahg nahg na hg and na hg history because of its importance in human health salt has long been an important commodity as shown by the english word salary which derives from salarium the wafers of salt sometimes given to roman soldiers along with their other wages in medieval europe a compound of sodium with the latin name of sodanum was used as a headache remedy the name sodium is thought to originate from the arabic suda meaning headache as the headache alleviating properties of sodium carbonate or soda were well known in early times although sodium sometimes called soda had long been recognized in compounds the metal itself was not isolated until by sir humphry davy through the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide in the german physicist and chemist ludwig wilhelm gilbert proposed the names natronium for humphry davy s sodium and kalium for davy s potassium the chemical abbreviation for sodium was first published in by j ns jakob berzelius in his system of atomic symbols and is an abbreviation of the element s new latin name natrium which refers to the egyptian natron a natural mineral salt mainly consisting of hydrated sodium carbonate natron historically had several important industrial and household uses later eclipsed by other sodium compounds sodium imparts an intense yellow color to flames as early as kirchhoff and bunsen noted the high sensitivity of a sodium flame test and stated in annalen der physik und chemie in a corner of our m room farthest away from the apparatus we exploded mg of sodium chlorate with milk sugar while observing the nonluminous flame before the slit after a while it glowed a bright yellow and showed a strong sodium line that disappeared only after minutes from the weight of the sodium salt and the volume of air in the room we easily calculate that one part by weight of air could not contain more than millionth weight of sodium occurrence the earth s crust contains sodium making it the seventh most abundant element on earth and the fifth most abundant metal behind aluminium iron calcium and magnesium and ahead of potassium sodium s estimated oceanic abundance is grams per liter because of its high reactivity it is never found as a pure element it is found in many minerals some very soluble such as halite and natron others much less soluble such as amphibole and zeolite the insolubility of certain sodium minerals such as cryolite and feldspar arises from their polymeric anions which in the case of feldspar is a polysilicate astronomical observations atomic sodium has a very strong spectral line in the yellow orange part of the spectrum the same line as is used in sodium vapour street lights this appears as an absorption line in many types of stars including the sun the line was first studied in by joseph von fraunhofer during his investigation of the lines in the solar spectrum now known as the fraunhofer lines fraunhofer named it the d line although it is now known to actually be a group of closely spaced lines split by a fine and hyperfine structure the strength of the d line allows its detection in many other astronomical environments in stars it is seen in any whose surfaces are cool enough for sodium to exist in atomic form rather than ionised this corresponds to stars of roughly f type and cooler many other stars appear to have a sodium absorption line but this is actually caused by gas in the foreground interstellar medium the two can be distinguished via high resolution spectroscopy because interstellar lines are much narrower than those broadened by stellar rotation sodium has also been detected in numerous solar system environments including mercury s atmosphere the exosphere of the moon and numerous other bodies some comets have a sodium tail which was first detected in observations of comet hale bopp in sodium has even been detected in the atmospheres of some extrasolar planets via transit spectroscopy commercial production employed only in rather specialized applications only about tonnes of metallic sodium are produced annually metallic sodium was first produced commercially in the late th century by carbothermal reduction of sodium carbonate at c as the first step of the deville process for the production of aluminium na co c na cothe high demand for aluminium created the need for the production of sodium the introduction of the hall h roult process for the production of aluminium by electrolysing a molten salt bath ended the need for large quantities of sodium a related process based on the reduction of sodium hydroxide was developed in sodium is now produced commercially through the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride based on a process patented in this is done in a downs cell in which the nacl is mixed with calcium chloride to lower the melting point below c as calcium is less electropositive than sodium no calcium will be deposited at the cathode this method is less expensive than the previous castner process the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide if sodium of high purity is required it can be distilled once or several times the market for sodium is volatile due to the difficulty in its storage and shipping it must be stored under a dry inert gas atmosphere or anhydrous mineral oil to prevent the formation of a surface layer of sodium oxide or sodium superoxide uses though metallic sodium has some important uses the major applications for sodium use compounds millions of tons of sodium chloride hydroxide and carbonate are produced annually sodium chloride is extensively used for anti icing and de icing and as a preservative examples of the uses of sodium bicarbonate include baking as a raising agent and sodablasting along with potassium many important medicines have sodium added to improve their bioavailability though potassium is the better ion in most cases sodium is chosen for its lower price and atomic weight sodium hydride is used as a base for various reactions such as the aldol reaction in organic chemistry and as a reducing agent in inorganic chemistry metallic sodium is used mainly for the production of sodium borohydride sodium azide indigo and triphenylphosphine a once common use was the making of tetraethyllead and titanium metal because of the move away from tel and new titanium production methods the production of sodium declined after sodium is also used as an alloying metal an anti scaling agent and as a reducing agent for metals when other materials are ineffective note the free element is not used as a scaling agent ions in the water are exchanged for sodium ions sodium plasma vapor lamps are often used for street lighting in cities shedding light that ranges from yellow orange to peach as the pressure increases by itself or with potassium sodium is a desiccant it gives an intense blue coloration with benzophenone when the desiccate is dry in organic synthesis sodium is used in various reactions such as the birch reduction and the sodium fusion test is conducted to qualitatively analyse compounds sodium reacts with alcohol and gives alkoxides and when sodium is dissolved in ammonia solution it can be used to reduce alkynes to trans alkenes lasers emitting light at the sodium d line are used to create artificial laser guide stars that assist in the adaptive optics for land based visible light telescopes heat transfer liquid sodium is used as a heat transfer fluid in sodium cooled fast reactors because it has the high thermal conductivity and low neutron absorption cross section required to achieve a high neutron flux in the reactor the high boiling point of sodium allows the reactor to operate at ambient normal pressure but drawbacks include its opacity which hinders visual maintenance and its strongly reducing properties sodium will explode in contact with water although it will only burn gently in air radioactive sodium may be produced by neutron bombardment during operation posing a slight radiation hazard the radioactivity stops within a few days after removal from the reactor if a reactor needs to be shut down frequently nak is used because nak is a liquid at room temperature the coolant does not solidify in the pipes in this case the pyrophoricity of potassium requires extra precautions to prevent and detect leaks another heat transfer application is poppet valves in high performance internal combustion engines the valve stems are partially filled with sodium and work as a heat pipe to cool the valves biological role biological role in humans in humans sodium is an essential mineral that regulates blood volume blood pressure osmotic equilibrium and ph the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is estimated to range from about milligrams per day in newborns to milligrams per day over the age of diet sodium chloride salt is the principal source of sodium in the diet and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky for americans most sodium chloride comes from processed foods other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate msg sodium nitrite sodium saccharin baking soda sodium bicarbonate and sodium benzoate the u s institute of medicine set its tolerable upper intake level for sodium at grams per day but the average person in the united states consumes grams per day the american heart association recommends no more than g of sodium per day high sodium consumption high sodium consumption is unhealthy and can lead to alteration in the mechanical performance of the heart high sodium consumption is also associated with chronic kidney disease high blood pressure cardiovascular diseases and stroke high blood pressure there is a strong correlation between higher sodium intake and higher blood pressure studies have found that lowering sodium intake by g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mm hg it has been estimated that such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to between and fewer cases of hypertension hypertension causes million premature deaths worldwide each year note that salt contains about sodium the rest being chlorine and trace chemicals thus g sodium is about g or ml of salt about one us teaspoon one study found that people with or without hypertension who excreted less than grams of sodium per day in their urine and therefore were taking in less than g d had a higher risk of death stroke or heart attack than those excreting to grams per day levels of g per day or more in people with hypertension were associated with higher mortality and cardiovascular events but this was not found to be true for people without hypertension the us fda states that adults with hypertension and prehypertension should reduce daily sodium intake to g physiology the renin angiotensin system regulates the amount of fluid and sodium concentration in the body reduction of blood pressure and sodium concentration in the kidney result in the production of renin which in turn produces aldosterone and angiotensin which stimulates the reabsorption of sodium back into the bloodstream when the concentration of sodium increases the production of renin decreases and the sodium concentration returns to normal the sodium ion na is an important electrolyte in neuron function and in osmoregulation between cells and the extracellular fluid this is accomplished in all animals by na k atpase an active transporter pumping ions against the gradient and sodium potassium channels sodium is the most prevalent metallic ion in extracellular fluid in humans unusually low or high sodium levels in the blood is recognized in medicine as hyponatremia and hypernatremia these conditions may be caused by genetic factors ageing or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea biological role in plants in c plants sodium is a micronutrient that aids metabolism specifically in regeneration of phosphoenolpyruvate and synthesis of chlorophyll in others it substitutes for potassium in several roles such as maintaining turgor pressure and aiding in the opening and closing of stomata excess sodium in the soil can limit the uptake of water by decreasing the water potential which may result in plant wilting excess concentrations in the cytoplasm can lead to enzyme inhibition which in turn causes necrosis and chlorosis in response some plants have developed mechanisms to limit sodium uptake in the roots to store it in cell vacuoles and restrict salt transport from roots to leaves excess sodium may also be stored in old plant tissue limiting the damage to new growth halophytes have adapted to be able to flourish in sodium rich environments safety and precautions sodium forms flammable hydrogen and caustic sodium hydroxide on contact with water ingestion and contact with moisture on skin eyes or mucous membranes can cause severe burns sodium spontaneously explodes in the presence of water due to the formation of hydrogen highly explosive and sodium hydroxide which dissolves in the water liberating more surface however sodium exposed to air and ignited or reaching autoignition reported to occur when a molten pool of sodium reaches about c f displays a relatively mild fire in the case of massive non molten pieces of sodium the reaction with oxygen eventually becomes slow due to formation of a protective layer fire extinguishers based on water accelerate sodium fires those based on carbon dioxide and bromochlorodifluoromethane should not be used on sodium fire metal fires are class d but not all class d extinguishers are effective when used to extinguish sodium fires an effective extinguishing agent for sodium fires is met l x other effective agents include lith x which has graphite powder and an organophosphate flame retardant and dry sand sodium fires are prevented in nuclear reactors by isolating sodium from oxygen with surrounding pipes containing inert gas pool type sodium fires are prevented using diverse design measures called catch pan systems they collect leaking sodium into a leak recovery tank where it is isolated from oxygen liquid sodium fires are more dangerous to handle than solid sodium fires particularly if there is insufficient experience with the safe handling of molten sodium in a technical report for the united states fire administration r j gordon writes emphasis in original once ignited sodium is very difficult to extinguish it will react violently with water as noted previously and with any extinguishing agent that contains water it will also react with many other common extinguishing agents including carbon dioxide and the halogen compounds and most dry chemical agents the only safe and effective extinguishing agents are completely dry inert materials such as class d extinguishing agents soda ash graphite diatomaceous earth or sodium chloride all of which can be used to bury a small quantity of burning sodium and exclude oxygen from reaching the metal the extinguishing agent must be absolutely dry as even a trace of water in the material can react with the burning sodium to cause an explosion sodium chloride is recognized as an extinguishing medium because of its chemical stability however it is hydroscopic has the property of attracting and holding water molecules on the surface of the salt crystals and must be kept absolutely dry to be used safely as an extinguishing agent every crystal of sodium chloride also contains a trace quantity of moisture within the structure of the crystal molten sodium is extremely dangerous because it is much more reactive than a solid mass in the liquid form every sodium atom is free and mobile to instantaneously combine with any available oxygen atom or other oxidizer and any gaseous by product will be created as a rapidly expanding gas bubble within the molten mass even a minute amount of water can create this type of reaction any amount of water introduced into a pool of molten sodium is likely to cause a violent explosion inside the liquid mass releasing the hydrogen as a rapidly expanding gas and causing the molten sodium to erupt from the container when molten sodium is involved in a fire the combustion occurs at the surface of the liquid an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon can be used to form an inert layer over the pool of burning liquid sodium but the gas must be applied very gently and contained over the surface except for soda ash most of the powdered agents that are used to extinguish small fires in solid pieces or shallow pools will sink to the bottom of a molten mass of burning sodium the sodium will float to the top and continue to burn if the burning sodium is in a container it may be feasible to extinguish the fire by placing a lid on the container to exclude oxygen ,11
Magnesium,Mg,magnesium is a chemical element with the symbol mg and atomic number it is a shiny gray solid which shares many physical and chemical properties with the other five alkaline earth metals group of the periodic table this element is produced in large aging stars from the sequential addition of three helium nuclei to a carbon nucleus when such stars explode as supernovas much of the magnesium is expelled into the interstellar medium where it may recycle into new star systems magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the earth s crust and the fourth most common element in the earth after iron oxygen and silicon making up of the planet s mass and a large fraction of the planet s mantle it is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater after sodium and chlorine magnesium occurs naturally only in combination with other elements where it almost always has a oxidation state the free element metal can be produced artificially and is highly reactive though in the atmosphere it is soon coated in a thin layer of oxide that partly inhibits reactivity see passivation the free metal burns with a characteristic brilliant white light the metal is now obtained mainly by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine and is used primarily as a component in aluminium magnesium alloys sometimes called magnalium or magnelium magnesium is less dense than aluminium and the alloy of the two is prized for its combination of lightness and strength this element is the eleventh most abundant element by mass in the human body and is essential to all cells and some enzymes magnesium ions interact with polyphosphate compounds such as atp dna and rna hundreds of enzymes require magnesium ions to function magnesium compounds are used medicinally as common laxatives antacids e g milk of magnesia and to stabilize abnormal nerve excitation or blood vessel spasm in such conditions as eclampsia characteristics physical properties elemental magnesium is a gray white lightweight metal two thirds the density of aluminium magnesium has the lowest melting k c and the lowest boiling point k c of all the alkaline earth metals pure polycrystalline magnesium is brittle and easily fractures along shear bands it becomes much more malleable when alloyed with small amount of other metals such as aluminium the malleability of polycrystalline magnesium can also be significantly improved by reducing its grain size to ca micron or less when finely powdered magnesium can react with water to produce hydrogen gas mg s h o g mg oh aq h g kjhowever this reaction is much less dramatic than the reactions of the alkali metals with water because the magnesium hydroxide tends to build up on the surface of the pure magnesium metal and prevent the reaction from occurring chemical properties general chemistry it tarnishes slightly when exposed to air although unlike the heavier alkaline earth metals an oxygen free environment is unnecessary for storage because magnesium is protected by a thin layer of oxide that is fairly impermeable and difficult to remove direct reaction of magnesium with air or oxygen at ambient pressure forms only the normal oxide mgo however this oxide may be combined with hydrogen peroxide to form magnesium peroxide mgo and at low temperature the peroxide may be further reacted with ozone to form magnesium superoxide mg o magnesium reacts with water at room temperature though it reacts much more slowly than calcium a similar group metal when submerged in water hydrogen bubbles form slowly on the surface of the metal though if powdered it reacts much more rapidly the reaction occurs faster with higher temperatures see safety precautions magnesium s reversible reaction with water can be harnessed to store energy and run a magnesium based engine magnesium also reacts exothermically with most acids such as hydrochloric acid hcl producing the metal chloride and hydrogen gas similar to the hcl reaction with aluminium zinc and many other metals flammability magnesium is highly flammable especially when powdered or shaved into thin strips though it is difficult to ignite in mass or bulk flame temperatures of magnesium and magnesium alloys can reach c f although flame height above the burning metal is usually less than mm in once ignited such fires are difficult to extinguish because combustion continues in nitrogen forming magnesium nitride carbon dioxide forming magnesium oxide and carbon and water forming magnesium oxide and hydrogen which also combusts due to heat in the presence of additional oxygen this property was used in incendiary weapons during the firebombing of cities in world war ii where the only practical civil defense was to smother a burning flare under dry sand to exclude atmosphere from the combustion magnesium may also be used as an igniter for thermite a mixture of aluminium and iron oxide powder that ignites only at a very high temperature organic chemistry organomagnesium compounds are widespread in organic chemistry they are commonly found as grignard reagents magnesium can react with haloalkanes to give grignard reagents examples of grignard reagents are phenylmagnesium bromide and ethylmagnesium bromide the grignard reagents function as a common nucleophile attacking the electrophilic group such as the carbon atom that is present within the polar bond of a carbonyl group a prominent organomagnesium reagent beyond grignard reagents is magnesium anthracene with magnesium forming a bridge over the central ring it is used as a source of highly active magnesium the related butadiene magnesium adduct serves as a source for the butadiene dianion magnesium in organic chemistry also appears as low valent magnesium compounds primarily with the magnesium forming diatomic ions in the oxidation state but more recently also with zero oxidation state or a mixture of and zero states such compounds find synthetic application as reducing agents and sources of nucleophilic metal atoms source of light when burning in air magnesium produces a brilliant white light that includes strong ultraviolet wavelengths magnesium powder flash powder was used for subject illumination in the early days of photography later magnesium filament was used in electrically ignited single use photography flashbulbs magnesium powder is used in fireworks and marine flares where a brilliant white light is required it was also used for various theatrical effects such as lightning pistol flashes and supernatural appearances detection in solution the presence of magnesium ions can be detected by the addition of ammonium chloride ammonium hydroxide and monosodium phosphate to an aqueous or dilute hcl solution of the salt the formation of a white precipitate indicates the presence of magnesium ions azo violet dye can also be used which turns deep blue in the presence of an alkaline solution of magnesium salt the color is due to the adsorption of azo violet by mg oh occurrence magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the earth s crust by mass and tied in seventh place with iron in molarity it is found in large deposits of magnesite dolomite and other minerals and in mineral waters where magnesium ion is soluble although magnesium is found in more than minerals only dolomite magnesite brucite carnallite talc and olivine are of commercial importance the mg cation is the second most abundant cation in seawater about the mass of sodium ions in a given sample which makes seawater and sea salt attractive commercial sources for mg to extract the magnesium calcium hydroxide is added to seawater to form magnesium hydroxide precipitate mgcl ca oh mg oh cacl magnesium hydroxide brucite is insoluble in water and can be filtered out and reacted with hydrochloric acid to produced concentrated magnesium chloride mg oh hcl mgcl h ofrom magnesium chloride electrolysis produces magnesium forms alloys as of magnesium alloys consumption was less than one million tonnes per year compared with million tonnes of aluminum alloys their use has been historically limited by the tendency of mg alloys to corrode creep at high temperatures and combust corrosion the presence of iron nickel copper and cobalt strongly activates corrosion in more than trace amounts these metals precipitate as intermetallic compounds and the precipitate locales function as active cathodic sites that reduce water causing the loss of magnesium controlling the quantity of these metals improves corrosion resistance sufficient manganese overcomes the corrosive effects of iron this requires precise control over composition increasing costs adding a cathodic poison captures atomic hydrogen within the structure of a metal this prevents the formation of free hydrogen gas an essential factor of corrosive chemical processes the addition of about one in three hundred parts arsenic reduces its corrosion rate in a salt solution by a factor of nearly ten high temperature creep and flammability research showed that magnesium s tendency to creep at high temperatures is eliminated by the addition of scandium and gadolinium flammability is greatly reduced by a small amount of calcium in the alloy by using rare earth elements it may be possible to manufacture magnesium alloys with an ignition temperature higher than magnesium s liquidus and in some cases potentially pushing it close to magnesium s boiling point compounds magnesium forms a variety of compounds important to industry and biology including magnesium carbonate magnesium chloride magnesium citrate magnesium hydroxide milk of magnesia magnesium oxide magnesium sulfate and magnesium sulfate heptahydrate epsom salts isotopes magnesium has three stable isotopes mg mg and mg all are present in significant amounts in nature see table of isotopes above about of mg is mg the isotope mg is radioactive and in the s to s was produced by several nuclear power plants for use in scientific experiments this isotope has a relatively short half life hours and its use was limited by shipping times the nuclide mg has found application in isotopic geology similar to that of aluminium mg is a radiogenic daughter product of al which has a half life of years excessive quantities of stable mg have been observed in the ca al rich inclusions of some carbonaceous chondrite meteorites this anomalous abundance is attributed to the decay of its parent al in the inclusions and researchers conclude that such meteorites were formed in the solar nebula before the al had decayed these are among the oldest objects in the solar system and contain preserved information about its early history it is conventional to plot mg mg against an al mg ratio in an isochron dating plot the al mg ratio plotted is al mg the slope of the isochron has no age significance but indicates the initial al al ratio in the sample at the time when the systems were separated from a common reservoir production world production was approximately kt in with the bulk being produced in china kt and russia kt the united states was in the th century the major world supplier of this metal supplying of world production even as recently as since the chinese mastery of the pidgeon process the us market share is at with a single us producer left us magnesium a renco group company in utah born from now defunct magcorp in september china took steps to reduce production of magnesium as a result of a government initiative to reduce energy availability for manufacturing industries leading to a significant price increase pidgeon processchina is almost completely reliant on the silicothermic pidgeon process the reduction of the oxide at high temperatures with silicon often provided by a ferrosilicon alloy in which the iron is but a spectator in the reactions to obtain the metal the process can also be carried out with carbon at approx c mgo s si s cao s mg g ca sio s mgo s c s mg g co g dow processin the united states magnesium is obtained principally with the dow process by electrolysis of fused magnesium chloride from brine and sea water a saline solution

magnesium chloride by treating the hydroxide with hydrochloric acid and heating of the product mg oh s hcl mgcl aq h o l the salt is then electrolyzed in the molten state at the cathode the mg ion is reduced by two electrons to magnesium metal mg e mgat the anode each pair of cl ions is oxidized to chlorine gas releasing two electrons to complete the circuit cl cl g e ysz processa new process solid oxide membrane technology involves the electrolytic reduction of mgo at the cathode mg ion is reduced by two electrons to magnesium metal the electrolyte is yttria stabilized zirconia ysz the anode is a liquid metal at the ysz liquid metal anode o is oxidized a layer of graphite borders the liquid metal anode and at this interface carbon and oxygen react to form carbon monoxide when silver is used as the liquid metal anode there is no reductant carbon or hydrogen needed and only oxygen gas is evolved at the anode it has been reported that this method provides a reduction in cost per pound over the electrolytic reduction method history the name magnesium originates from the greek word for locations related to the tribe of the magnetes either a district in thessaly called magnesia or magnesia ad sipylum now in turkey it is related to magnetite and manganese which also originated from this area and required differentiation as separate substances see manganese for this history in a farmer at epsom in england attempted to give his cows water from a well there the cows refused to drink because of the water s bitter taste but the farmer noticed that the water seemed to heal scratches and rashes the substance became known as epsom salts and its fame spread it was eventually recognized as hydrated magnesium sulfate mgso h o the metal itself was first isolated by sir humphry davy in england in he used electrolysis on a mixture of magnesia and mercuric oxide antoine bussy prepared it in coherent form in davy s first suggestion for a name was magnium but the name magnesium is now used in english and all major european languages but russian uses as a metal magnesium is the third most commonly used structural metal following iron and aluminium the main applications of magnesium are in order aluminium alloys die casting alloyed with zinc removing sulfur in the production of iron and steel and the production of titanium in the kroll process magnesium is used in lightweight materials and alloys for example when infused with silicon carbide nanoparticles it has extremely high specific strength historically magnesium was one of the main aerospace construction metals and was used for german military aircraft as early as world war i and extensively for german aircraft in world war ii the germans coined the name elektron for magnesium alloy a term which is still used today in the commercial aerospace industry magnesium was generally restricted to engine related components due to fire and corrosion hazards magnesium alloy use in aerospace is increasing in the st century driven by the importance of fuel economy development and testing of new magnesium alloys continues notably elektron which in test has proved suitable for aerospace engine internal and airframe components the european community runs three r d magnesium projects in the aerospace priority of the fp program recent developments in metallurgy and manufacturing have allowed for the potential for magnesium alloys to act as replacements for aluminium and steel alloys in certain applications in the form of thin ribbons magnesium is used to purify solvents for example preparing super dry ethanol aircraft wright aeronautical used a magnesium crankcase in the wwii era wright r duplex cyclone aviation engine this presented a serious problem for the earliest models of the boeing b superfortress heavy bomber when an in flight engine fire ignited the engine crankcase the resulting combustion was as hot as f c and could sever the wing spar from the fuselage automotive mercedes benz used the alloy elektron in the bodywork of an early model mercedes benz slr these cars competed in the world sportscar championship including a win at the mille miglia and at le mans where one was involved in the le mans disaster when spectators were showered with burning fragments of elektron porsche used magnesium alloy frames in the that won le mans in and continues to use magnesium alloys for its engine blocks due to the weight advantage volkswagen group has used magnesium in its engine components for many years mitsubishi motors uses magnesium for its paddle shifters bmw used magnesium alloy blocks in their n engine including an aluminium alloy insert for the cylinder walls and cooling jackets surrounded by a high temperature magnesium alloy aj a the engine was used worldwide between and in various and series models as well as the z x x and x chevrolet used the magnesium alloy ae in the corvette z both aj a and ae are recent developments in high temperature low creep magnesium alloys the general strategy for such alloys is to form intermetallic precipitates at the grain boundaries for example by adding mischmetal or calcium new alloy development and lower costs that make magnesium competitive with aluminium will increase the number of automotive applications electronics because of low density and good mechanical and electrical properties magnesium is used for manufacturing of mobile phones laptop and tablet computers cameras and other electronic components it was used as a premium feature because of its light weight in some laptops other magnesium being readily available and relatively nontoxic has a variety of uses magnesium is flammable burning at a temperature of approximately c k f and the autoignition temperature of magnesium ribbon is approximately c k f it produces intense bright white light when it burns magnesium s high combustion temperature makes it a useful tool for starting emergency fires other uses include flash photography flares pyrotechnics fireworks sparklers and trick birthday candles magnesium is also often used to ignite thermite or other materials that require a high ignition temperature magnesium continues to be used as an incendiary element in warfare in the form of turnings or ribbons to prepare grignard reagents which are useful in organic synthesis as an additive agent in conventional propellants and the production of nodular graphite in cast iron as a reducing agent to separate uranium and other metals from their salts as a sacrificial galvanic anode to protect boats underground tanks pipelines buried structures and water heaters alloyed with zinc to produce the zinc sheet used in photoengraving plates in the printing industry dry cell battery walls and roofing as a metal this element s principal use is as an alloying additive to aluminium with these aluminium magnesium alloys being used mainly for beverage cans sports equipment such as golf clubs fishing reels and archery bows and arrows specialty high grade car wheels of magnesium alloy are called mag wheels although the term is often misapplied to aluminium wheels many car and aircraft manufacturers have made engine and body parts from magnesium magnesium batteries have been commercialized as primary batteries and are an active topic of research for rechargeable batteries safety precautions magnesium metal and its alloys can be explosive hazards they are highly flammable in their pure form when molten or in powder or ribbon form burning or molten magnesium reacts violently with water when working with powdered magnesium safety glasses with eye protection and uv filters such as welders use are employed because burning magnesium produces ultraviolet light that can permanently damage the retina of a human eye magnesium is capable of reducing water and releasing highly flammable hydrogen gas mg s h o l mg oh s h g therefore water cannot extinguish magnesium fires the hydrogen gas produced intensifies the fire dry sand is an effective smothering agent but only on relatively level and flat surfaces magnesium reacts with carbon dioxide exothermically to form magnesium oxide and carbon mg co mgo c s hence carbon dioxide fuels rather than extinguishes magnesium fires burning magnesium can be quenched by using a class d dry chemical fire extinguisher or by covering the fire with sand or magnesium foundry flux to remove its air source useful compounds magnesium compounds primarily magnesium oxide mgo are used as a refractory material in furnace linings for producing iron steel nonferrous metals glass and cement magnesium oxide and other magnesium compounds are also used in the agricultural chemical and construction industries magnesium oxide from calcination is used as an electrical insulator in fire resistant cables magnesium hydride is under investigation as a way to store hydrogen magnesium reacted with an alkyl halide gives a grignard reagent which is a very useful

paper sulfite process magnesium phosphate is used to fireproof wood used in construction magnesium hexafluorosilicate is used for moth proofing textiles biological roles mechanism of action the important interaction between phosphate and magnesium ions makes magnesium essential to the basic nucleic acid chemistry of all cells of all known living organisms more than enzymes require magnesium ions for their catalytic action including all enzymes using or synthesizing atp and those that use other nucleotides to synthesize dna and rna the atp molecule is normally found in a chelate with a magnesium ion nutrition diet spices nuts cereals cocoa and vegetables are rich sources of magnesium green leafy vegetables such as spinach are also rich in magnesium beverages rich in magnesium are coffee tea and cocoa dietary recommendations in the uk the recommended daily values for magnesium are mg for men and mg for women in the u s the recommended dietary allowances rdas are mg for men ages and mg for older for women mg for ages and mg for older supplementation numerous pharmaceutical preparations of magnesium and dietary supplements are available in two human trials magnesium oxide one of the most common forms in magnesium dietary supplements because of its high magnesium content per weight was less bioavailable than magnesium citrate chloride lactate or aspartate metabolism an adult body has grams of magnesium with in the skeleton intracellular in skeletal muscle and extracellular serum levels are typically mmol l or meq l serum magnesium levels may be normal even when intracellular magnesium is deficient the mechanisms for maintaining the magnesium level in the serum are varying gastrointestinal absorption and renal excretion intracellular magnesium is correlated with intracellular potassium increased magnesium lowers calcium and can either prevent hypercalcemia or cause hypocalcemia depending on the initial level both low and high protein intake conditions inhibit magnesium absorption as does the amount of phosphate phytate and fat in the gut unabsorbed dietary magnesium is excreted in feces absorbed magnesium is excreted in urine and sweat detection in serum and plasma magnesium status may be assessed by measuring serum and erythrocyte magnesium concentrations coupled with urinary and fecal magnesium content but intravenous magnesium loading tests are more accurate and practical a retention of or more of the injected amount indicates deficiency as of no biomarker has been established for magnesium magnesium concentrations in plasma or serum may be monitored for efficacy and safety in those receiving the drug therapeutically to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose the newborn children of mothers who received parenteral magnesium sulfate during labor may exhibit toxicity with normal serum magnesium levels deficiency low plasma magnesium hypomagnesemia is common it is found in of the general population from to percent of the united states population consumed less magnesium than recommended in the dietary reference intake other causes are increased renal or gastrointestinal loss an increased intracellular shift and proton pump inhibitor antacid therapy most are asymptomatic but symptoms referable to neuromuscular cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunction may occur alcoholism is often associated with magnesium deficiency chronically low serum magnesium levels are associated with metabolic syndrome diabetes mellitus type fasciculation and hypertension therapy intravenous magnesium is recommended by the acc aha esc guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death for patients with ventricular arrhythmia associated with torsades de pointes who present with long qt syndrome and for the treatment of patients with digoxin induced arrhythmias magnesium sulfate intravenous is used for the management of pre eclampsia and eclampsia hypomagnesemia including that caused by alcoholism is reversible by oral or parenteral magnesium administration depending on the degree of deficiency there is limited evidence that magnesium supplementation may play a role in the prevention and treatment of migraine sorted by type of magnesium salt other therapeutic applications include magnesium sulfate as the heptahydrate called epsom salts is used as bath salts a laxative and a highly soluble fertilizer magnesium hydroxide suspended in water is used in milk of magnesia antacids and laxatives magnesium chloride oxide gluconate malate orotate glycinate ascorbate and citrate are all used as oral magnesium supplements magnesium borate magnesium salicylate and magnesium sulfate are used as antiseptics magnesium bromide is used as a mild sedative this action is due to the bromide not the magnesium magnesium stearate is a slightly flammable white powder with lubricating properties in pharmaceutical technology it is used in pharmacological manufacture to prevent tablets from sticking to the equipment while compressing the ingredients into tablet form magnesium carbonate powder is used by athletes such as gymnasts weightlifters and climbers to eliminate palm sweat prevent sticking and improve the grip on gymnastic apparatus lifting bars and climbing rocks overdose overdose from dietary sources alone is unlikely because excess magnesium in the blood is promptly filtered by the kidneys and overdose is more likely in the presence of impaired renal function in spite of this megadose therapy has caused death in a young child and severe hypermagnesemia in a woman and a young girl who had healthy kidneys the most common symptoms of overdose are nausea vomiting and diarrhea other symptoms include hypotension confusion slowed heart and respiratory rates deficiencies of other minerals coma cardiac arrhythmia and death from cardiac arrest function in plants plants require magnesium to synthesize chlorophyll essential for photosynthesis magnesium in the center of the porphyrin ring in chlorophyll functions in a manner similar to the iron in the center of the porphyrin ring in heme magnesium deficiency in plants causes late season yellowing between leaf veins especially in older leaves and can be corrected by either applying epsom salts which is rapidly leached or crushed dolomitic limestone to the soil ,12
Aluminum,Al,aluminium aluminum in american and canadian english is a chemical element with the symbol al and atomic number aluminium has a density lower than those of other common metals at approximately one third that of steel it has a great affinity towards oxygen and forms a protective layer of oxide on the surface when exposed to air aluminium visually resembles silver both in its color and in its great ability to reflect light it is soft non magnetic and ductile it has one stable isotope al this isotope is very common making aluminium the twelfth most common element in the universe the radioactivity of al is used in radiodating chemically aluminium is a post transition metal in the boron group as is common for the group aluminium forms compounds primarily in the oxidation state the aluminium cation al is small and highly charged as such it is polarizing and bonds aluminium forms tend towards covalency the strong affinity towards oxygen leads to aluminium s common association with oxygen in nature in the form of oxides for this reason aluminium is found on earth primarily in rocks in the crust where it is the third most abundant element after oxygen and silicon rather than in the mantle and virtually never as the free metal the discovery of aluminium was announced in by danish physicist hans christian rsted the first industrial production of aluminium was initiated by french chemist henri tienne sainte claire deville in aluminium became much more available to the public with the hall h roult process developed independently by french engineer paul h roult and american engineer charles martin hall in and the mass production of aluminium led to its extensive use in industry and everyday life in world wars i and ii aluminium was a crucial strategic resource for aviation in aluminium became the most produced non ferrous metal surpassing copper in the st century most aluminium was consumed in transportation engineering construction and packaging in the united states western europe and japan despite its prevalence in the environment no living organism is known to use aluminium salts metabolically but aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals because of the abundance of these salts the potential for a biological role for them is of interest and studies continue physical characteristics isotopes of aluminium isotopes only al is stable this situation is common for elements with an odd atomic number it is the only primordial aluminium isotope i e the only one that has existed on earth in its current form since the formation of the planet nearly all aluminium on earth is present as this isotope which makes it a mononuclidic element and means that its standard atomic weight is virtually the same as that of the isotope this makes aluminium very useful in nuclear magnetic resonance nmr as its single stable isotope has a high nmr sensitivity the standard atomic weight of aluminium is low in comparison with many other metals all other isotopes of aluminium are radioactive the most stable of these is al while it was present along with stable al in the interstellar medium from which the solar system formed having been produced by stellar nucleosynthesis as well its half life is only years and therefore a detectable amount has not survived since the formation of the planet however minute traces of al are produced from argon in the atmosphere by spallation caused by cosmic ray protons the ratio of al to be has been used for radiodating of geological processes over to year time scales in particular transport deposition sediment storage burial times and erosion most meteorite scientists believe that the energy released by the decay of al was responsible for the melting and differentiation of some asteroids after their formation billion years ago the remaining isotopes of aluminium with mass numbers ranging from to all have half lives well under an hour three metastable states are known all with half lives under a minute electron shell an aluminium atom has electrons arranged in an electron configuration of ne s p with three electrons beyond a stable noble gas configuration accordingly the combined first three ionization energies of aluminium are far lower than the fourth ionization energy alone such an electron configuration is shared with the other well characterized members of its group boron gallium indium and thallium it is also expected for nihonium aluminium can relatively easily surrender its three outermost electrons in many chemical reactions see below the electronegativity of aluminium is pauling scale a free aluminium atom has a radius of pm with the three outermost electrons removed the radius shrinks to pm for a coordinated atom or pm for a coordinated atom at standard temperature and pressure aluminium atoms when not affected by atoms of other elements form a face centered cubic crystal system bound by metallic bonding provided by atoms outermost electrons hence aluminium at these conditions is a metal this crystal system is shared by many other metals such as lead and copper the size of a unit cell of aluminium is comparable to that of those other metals the system however is not shared by the other members of its group boron has ionization energies too high to allow metallization thallium has a hexagonal close packed structure and gallium and indium have unusual structures that are not close packed like those of aluminium and thallium the few electrons that are available for metallic bonding in aluminium metal are a probable cause for it being soft with a low melting point and low electrical resistivity bulk aluminium metal has an appearance ranging from silvery white to dull gray depending on the surface roughness aluminium mirrors are the most reflective of all metal mirrors for the near ultraviolet and far infrared light and one of the most reflective in the visible spectrum nearly on par with silver and the two therefore look similar aluminium is also good at reflecting solar radiation although prolonged exposure to sunlight in air adds wear to the surface of the metal this may be prevented if aluminium is anodized which adds a protective layer of oxide on the surface the density of aluminium is g cm about that of steel much lower than other commonly encountered metals making aluminium parts easily identifiable through their lightness aluminium s low density compared to most other metals arises from the fact that its nuclei are much lighter while difference in the unit cell size does not compensate for this difference the only lighter metals are the metals of groups and which apart from beryllium and magnesium are too reactive for structural use and beryllium is very toxic aluminium is not as strong or stiff as steel but the low density makes up for this in the aerospace industry and for many other applications where light weight and relatively high strength are crucial pure aluminium is quite soft and lacking in strength in most applications various aluminium alloys are used instead because of their higher strength and hardness the yield strength of pure aluminium is mpa while aluminium alloys have yield strengths ranging from mpa to mpa aluminium is ductile with a percent elongation of and malleable allowing it to be easily drawn and extruded it is also easily machined and cast aluminium is an excellent thermal and electrical conductor having around the conductivity of copper both thermal and electrical while having only of copper s density aluminium is capable of superconductivity with a superconducting critical temperature of kelvin and a critical magnetic field of about gauss milliteslas it is paramagnetic and thus essentially unaffected by static magnetic fields the high electrical conductivity however means that it is strongly affected by alternating magnetic fields through the induction of eddy currents chemistry aluminium combines characteristics of pre and post transition metals since it has few available electrons for metallic bonding like its heavier group congeners it has the characteristic physical properties of a post transition metal with longer than expected interatomic distances furthermore as al is a small and highly charged cation it is strongly polarizing and bonding in aluminium compounds tends towards covalency this behavior is similar to that of beryllium be and the two display an example of a diagonal relationship the underlying core under aluminium s valence shell is that of the preceding noble gas whereas those of its heavier congeners gallium indium thallium and nihonium also include a filled d subshell and in some cases a filled f subshell hence the inner electrons of aluminium shield the valence electrons almost completely unlike those of aluminium s heavier congeners as such aluminium is the most electropositive metal in its group and its hydroxide is in fact more basic than that of gallium aluminium also bears minor similarities to the metalloid boron in the same group alx compounds are valence isoelectronic to bx compounds they have the same valence electronic structure and both behave as lewis acids and readily form adducts additionally one of the main motifs of boron chemistry is regular icosahedral structures and aluminium forms an important part of many icosahedral quasicrystal alloys including the al zn mg class aluminium has a high chemical affinity to oxygen which renders it suitable for use as a reducing agent in the thermite reaction a fine powder of aluminium metal reacts explosively on contact with liquid oxygen under normal conditions however aluminium forms a thin oxide layer nm at room temperature that protects the metal from further corrosion by oxygen water or dilute acid a process termed passivation because of its general resistance to corrosion aluminium is one of the few metals that retains silvery reflectance in finely powdered form making it an important component of silver colored paints aluminium is not attacked by oxidizing acids because of its passivation this allows aluminium to be used to store reagents such as nitric acid concentrated sulfuric acid and some organic acids in hot concentrated hydrochloric acid aluminium reacts with water with evolution of hydrogen and in aqueous sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide at room temperature to form aluminates protective passivation under these conditions is negligible aqua regia also dissolves aluminium aluminium is corroded by dissolved chlorides such as common sodium chloride which is why household plumbing is never made from aluminium the oxide layer on aluminium is also destroyed by contact with mercury due to amalgamation or with salts of some electropositive metals as such the strongest aluminium alloys are less corrosion resistant due to galvanic reactions with alloyed copper and aluminium s corrosion resistance is greatly reduced by aqueous salts particularly in the presence of dissimilar metals aluminium reacts with most nonmetals upon heating forming compounds such as aluminium nitride aln aluminium sulfide al s and the aluminium halides alx it also forms a wide range of intermetallic compounds involving metals from every group on the periodic table inorganic compounds the vast majority of compounds including all aluminium containing minerals and all commercially significant aluminium compounds feature aluminium in the oxidation state the coordination number of such compounds varies but generally al is either six or four coordinate almost all compounds of aluminium iii are colorless in aqueous solution al exists as the hexaaqua cation al h o which has an approximate ka of such solutions are acidic as this cation can act as a proton donor and progressively hydrolyze until a precipitate of aluminium hydroxide al oh forms this is useful for clarification of water as the precipitate nucleates on suspended particles in the water hence removing them increasing the ph even further leads to the hydroxide dissolving again as aluminate al h o oh is formed aluminium hydroxide forms both salts and aluminates and dissolves in acid and alkali as well as on fusion with acidic and basic oxides this behavior of al oh is termed amphoterism and is characteristic of weakly basic cations that form insoluble hydroxides and whose hydrated species can also donate their protons one effect of this is that aluminium salts with weak acids are hydrolyzed in water to the aquated hydroxide and the corresponding nonmetal hydride for example aluminium sulfide yields hydrogen sulfide however some salts like aluminium carbonate exist in aqueous solution but are unstable as such and only incomplete hydrolysis takes place for salts with strong acids such as the halides nitrate and sulfate for similar reasons anhydrous aluminium salts cannot be made by heating their hydrates hydrated aluminium chloride is in fact not alcl h o but al h o cl and the al o bonds are so strong that heating is not sufficient to break them and form al cl bonds instead al h o cl heat al o hcl h oall four trihalides are well known unlike the structures of the three heavier trihalides aluminium fluoride alf features six coordinate aluminium which explains its involatility and insolubility as well as high heat of formation each aluminium atom is surrounded by six fluorine atoms in a distorted octahedral arrangement with each fluorine atom being shared between the corners of two octahedra such alf units also exist in complex fluorides such as cryolite na alf alf melts at c f and is made by reaction of aluminium oxide with hydrogen fluoride gas at c f with heavier halides the coordination numbers are lower the other trihalides are dimeric or polymeric with tetrahedral four coordinate aluminium centers aluminium trichloride alcl has a layered polymeric structure below its melting point of c f but transforms on melting to al cl dimers at higher temperatures those increasingly dissociate into trigonal planar alcl monomers similar to the structure of bcl aluminium tribromide and aluminium triiodide form al x dimers in all three phases and hence do not show such significant changes of properties upon phase change these materials are prepared by treating aluminium metal with the halogen the aluminium trihalides form many addition compounds or complexes their lewis acidic nature makes them useful as catalysts for the friedel crafts reactions aluminium trichloride has major industrial uses involving this reaction such as in the manufacture of anthraquinones and styrene it is also often used as the precursor for many other aluminium compounds and as a reagent for converting nonmetal fluorides into the corresponding chlorides a transhalogenation reaction aluminium forms one stable oxide with the chemical formula al o commonly called alumina it can be found in nature in the mineral corundum alumina there is also a alumina phase its crystalline form corundum is very hard mohs hardness has a high melting point of c f has very low volatility is chemically inert and a good electrical insulator it is often used in abrasives such as toothpaste as a refractory material and in ceramics as well as being the starting material for the electrolytic production of aluminium metal sapphire and ruby are impure corundum contaminated with trace amounts of other metals the two main oxide hydroxides alo oh are boehmite and diaspore there are three main trihydroxides bayerite gibbsite and nordstrandite which differ in their crystalline structure polymorphs many other intermediate and related structures are also known most are produced from ores by a variety of wet processes using acid and base heating the hydroxides leads to formation of corundum these materials are of central importance to the production of aluminium and are themselves extremely useful some mixed oxide phases are also very useful such as spinel mgal o na alumina naal o and tricalcium aluminate ca al o an important mineral phase in portland cement the only stable chalcogenides under normal conditions are aluminium sulfide al s selenide al se and telluride al te all three are prepared by direct reaction of their elements at about c f and quickly hydrolyze completely in water to yield aluminium hydroxide and the respective hydrogen chalcogenide as aluminium is a small atom relative to these chalcogens these have four coordinate tetrahedral aluminium with various polymorphs having structures related to wurtzite with two thirds of the possible metal sites occupied either in an orderly or random fashion the sulfide also has a form related to alumina and an unusual high temperature hexagonal form where half the aluminium atoms have tetrahedral four coordination and the other half have trigonal bipyramidal five coordination four pnictides aluminium nitride aln aluminium phosphide alp aluminium arsenide alas and aluminium antimonide alsb are known they are all iii v semiconductors isoelectronic to silicon and germanium all of which but aln have the zinc blende structure all four can be made by high temperature and possibly high pressure direct reaction of their component elements aluminium alloys well with most other metals with the exception of most alkali metals and group metals and over intermetallics with other metals are known preparation involves heating fixed metals together in certain proportion followed by gradual cooling and annealing bonding in them is predominantly metallic and the crystal structure primarily depends on efficiency of packing there are few compounds with lower oxidation states a few aluminium i compounds exist alf alcl albr and ali exist in the gaseous phase when the respective trihalide is heated with aluminium and at cryogenic temperatures a stable derivative of aluminium monoiodide is the cyclic adduct formed with triethylamine al i net al o and al s also exist but are very unstable very simple aluminium ii compounds are invoked or observed in the reactions of al metal with oxidants for example aluminium monoxide alo has been detected in the gas phase after explosion and in stellar absorption spectra more thoroughly investigated are compounds of the formula r al which contain an al al bond and where r is a large organic ligand organoaluminium compounds and related hydrides a variety of compounds of empirical formula alr and alr cl exist the aluminium trialkyls and triaryls are reactive volatile and colorless liquids or low melting solids they catch fire spontaneously in air and react with water thus necessitating precautions when handling them they often form dimers unlike their boron analogues but this tendency diminishes for branched chain alkyls e g pri bui me cch for example triisobutylaluminium exists as an equilibrium mixture of the monomer and dimer these dimers such as trimethylaluminium al me usually feature tetrahedral al centers formed by dimerization with some alkyl group bridging between both aluminium atoms they are hard acids and react readily with ligands forming adducts in industry they are mostly used in alkene insertion reactions as discovered by karl ziegler most importantly in growth reactions that form long chain unbranched primary alkenes and alcohols and in the low pressure polymerization of ethene and propene there are also some heterocyclic and cluster organoaluminium compounds involving al n bonds the industrially most important aluminium hydride is lithium aluminium hydride lialh which is used in as a reducing agent in organic chemistry it can be produced from lithium hydride and aluminium trichloride the simplest hydride aluminium hydride or alane is not as important it is a polymer with the formula alh n in contrast to the corresponding boron hydride that is a dimer with the formula bh natural occurrence space aluminium s per particle abundance in the solar system is ppm parts per million it is the twelfth most abundant of all elements and third most abundant among the elements that have odd atomic numbers after hydrogen and nitrogen the only stable isotope of aluminium al is the eighteenth most abundant nucleus in the universe it is created almost entirely after fusion of carbon in massive stars that will later become type ii supernovas this fusion creates mg which upon capturing free protons and neutrons becomes aluminium some smaller quantities of al are created in hydrogen burning shells of evolved stars where mg can capture free protons essentially all aluminium now in existence is al al was present in the early solar system with abundance of relative to al but its half life of years is too short for any original nuclei to survive al is therefore extinct unlike for al hydrogen burning is the primary source of al with the nuclide emerging after a nucleus of mg catches a free proton however the trace quantities of al that do exist are the most common gamma ray emitter in the interstellar gas if the original al were still present gamma ray maps of the milky way would be brighter earth overall the earth is about aluminium by mass seventh in abundance by mass aluminium occurs in greater proportion in the earth s crust than in the universe at large because aluminium easily forms the oxide and becomes bound into rocks and stays in the earth s crust while less reactive metals sink to the core in the earth s crust aluminium is the most abundant metallic element by mass and the third most abundant of all elements after oxygen and silicon a large number of silicates in the earth s crust contain aluminium in contrast the earth s mantle is only aluminium by mass aluminium also occurs in seawater at a concentration of g kg because of its strong affinity for oxygen aluminium is almost never found in the elemental state instead it is found in oxides or silicates feldspars the most common group of minerals in the earth s crust are aluminosilicates aluminium also occurs in the minerals beryl cryolite garnet spinel and turquoise impurities in al o such as chromium and iron yield the gemstones ruby and sapphire respectively native aluminium metal is extremely rare and can only be found as a minor phase in low oxygen fugacity environments such as the interiors of certain volcanoes native aluminium has been reported in cold seeps in the northeastern continental slope of the south china sea it is possible that these deposits resulted from bacterial reduction of tetrahydroxoaluminate al oh although aluminium is a common and widespread element not all aluminium minerals are economically viable sources of the metal almost all metallic aluminium is produced from the ore bauxite alox oh x bauxite occurs as a weathering product of low iron and silica bedrock in tropical climatic conditions in most bauxite was mined in australia china guinea and india history the history of aluminium has been shaped by usage of alum the first written record of alum made by greek historian herodotus dates back to the th century bce the ancients are known to have used alum as a dyeing mordant and for city defense after the crusades alum an indispensable good in the european fabric industry was a subject of international commerce it was imported to europe from the eastern mediterranean until the mid th century the nature of alum remained unknown around swiss physician paracelsus suggested alum was a salt of an earth of alum in german doctor and chemist andreas libavius experimentally confirmed this in german chemist friedrich hoffmann announced his belief that the base of alum was a distinct earth in german chemist andreas sigismund marggraf synthesized alumina by boiling clay in sulfuric acid and subsequently adding potash attempts to produce aluminium metal date back to the first successful attempt however was completed in by danish physicist and chemist hans christian rsted he reacted anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium amalgam yielding a lump of metal looking similar to tin he presented his results and demonstrated a sample of the new metal in in german chemist friedrich w hler repeated rsted s experiments but did not identify any aluminium the reason for this inconsistency was only discovered in he conducted a similar experiment in the same year by mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium and produced a powder of aluminium in he was able to produce small pieces of the metal and described some physical properties of this metal for many years thereafter w hler was credited as the discoverer of aluminium as w hler s method could not yield great quantities of aluminium the metal remained rare its cost exceeded that of gold the first industrial production of aluminium was established in by french chemist henri etienne sainte claire deville and companions deville had discovered that aluminium trichloride could be reduced by sodium which was more convenient and less expensive than potassium which w hler had used even then aluminium was still not of great purity and produced aluminium differed in properties by sample because of its electricity conducting capacity aluminium was used as the cap of the washington monument completed in the tallest building in the world at the time the non corroding metal cap was intended to serve as a lightning rod peak the first industrial large scale production method was independently developed in by french engineer paul h roult and american engineer charles martin hall it is now known as the hall h roult process the hall h roult process converts alumina into metal austrian chemist carl joseph bayer discovered a way of purifying bauxite to yield alumina now known as the bayer process in modern production of the aluminium metal is based on the bayer and hall h roult processes prices of aluminium dropped and aluminium became widely used in jewelry everyday items eyeglass frames optical instruments tableware and foil in the s and early th century aluminium s ability to form hard yet light alloys with other metals provided the metal with many uses at the time during world war i major governments demanded large shipments of aluminium for light strong airframes during world war ii demand by major governments for aviation was even higher by the mid th century aluminium had become a part of everyday life and an essential component of housewares in production of aluminium surpassed that of copper historically second in production only to iron making it the most produced non ferrous metal during the mid th century aluminium emerged as a civil engineering material with building applications in both basic construction and interior finish work and increasingly being used in military engineering for both airplanes and land armor vehicle engines earth s first artificial satellite launched in consisted of two separate aluminium semi spheres joined and all subsequent space vehicles have used aluminium to some extent the aluminium can was invented in and employed as a storage for drinks in throughout the th century the production of aluminium rose rapidly while the world production of aluminium in was metric tons the annual production first exceeded metric tons in tons in tons in in the s the increased demand for aluminium made it an exchange commodity it entered the london metal exchange the oldest industrial metal exchange in the world in the output continued to grow the annual production of aluminium exceeded metric tons in the real price for aluminium declined from per metric ton in to in in united states dollars extraction and processing costs were lowered over technological progress and the scale of the economies however the need to exploit lower grade poorer quality deposits and the use of fast increasing input costs above all energy increased the net cost of aluminium the real price began to grow in the s with the rise of energy cost production moved from the industrialized countries to countries where production was cheaper production costs in the late th century changed because of advances in technology lower energy prices exchange rates of the united states dollar and alumina prices the bric countries combined share in primary production and primary consumption grew substantially in the first decade of the st century china is accumulating an especially large share of the world s production thanks to an abundance of resources cheap energy and governmental stimuli it also increased its consumption share from in to in in the united states western europe and japan most aluminium was consumed in transportation engineering construction and packaging in prices for industrial metals such as aluminium have soared to near record levels as energy shortages in china drive up costs for electricity etymology the names aluminium and aluminum are derived from the word alumine an obsolete term for alumina a naturally occurring oxide of aluminium alumine was borrowed from french which in turn derived it from alumen the classical latin name for alum the mineral from which it was collected the latin word alumen stems from the proto indo european root alu meaning bitter or beer origins british chemist humphry davy who performed a number of experiments aimed to isolate the metal is credited as the person who named the element the first name proposed for the metal to be isolated from alum was alumium which davy suggested in an article on his electrochemical research published in philosophical transactions of the royal society it appeared that the name was created from the english word alum and the latin suffix ium but it was customary then to give elements names originating in latin so that this name was not adopted universally this name was criticized by contemporary chemists from france germany and sweden who insisted the metal should be named for the oxide alumina from which it would be isolated the english name alum does not come directly from latin whereas alumine alumina obviously comes from the latin word alumen upon declension alumen changes to alumin one example was essai sur la nomenclature chimique july written in french by a swedish chemist j ns jacob berzelius in which the name aluminium is given to the element that would be synthesized from alum another article in the same journal issue also gives the name aluminium to the metal whose oxide is the basis of sapphire a january summary of one of davy s lectures at the royal society mentioned the name aluminium as a possibility the next year davy published a chemistry textbook in which he used the spelling aluminum both spellings have coexisted since their usage is regional aluminum dominates in the united states and canada aluminium in the rest of the english speaking world spelling in a british scientist thomas young wrote an anonymous review of davy s book in which he proposed the name aluminium instead of aluminum which he thought had a less classical sound this name did catch on although the um spelling was occasionally used in britain the american scientific language used ium from the start most scientists throughout the world used ium in the th century and it was entrenched in many other european languages such as french german and dutch in an american lexicographer noah webster entered only the aluminum spelling in his american dictionary of the english language in the s the um spelling gained usage in the united states by the s it had become the more common spelling there outside science in hall used the um spelling in his advertising handbill for his new electrolytic method of producing the metal despite his constant use of the ium spelling in all the patents he filed between and it is unknown whether this spelling was introduced by mistake or intentionally but hall preferred aluminum since its introduction because it resembled platinum the name of a prestigious metal by both spellings had been common in the united states the ium spelling being slightly more common by the situation had reversed by aluminum had become twice as common as aluminium in the next decade the um spelling dominated american usage in the american chemical society adopted this spelling the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac adopted aluminium as the standard international name for the element in in they recognized aluminum as an acceptable variant the most recent edition of the iupac nomenclature of inorganic chemistry also acknowledges this spelling iupac official publications use the ium spelling as primary and they list both where it is appropriate production and refinement the production of aluminium starts with the extraction of bauxite rock from the ground the bauxite is processed and transformed using the bayer process into alumina which is then processed using the hall h roult process resulting in the final aluminium metal aluminium production is highly energy consuming and so the producers tend to locate smelters in places where electric power is both plentiful and inexpensive as of the world s largest smelters of aluminium are located in china india russia canada and the united arab emirates while china is by far the top producer of aluminium with a world share of fifty five percent according to the international resource panel s metal stocks in society report the global per capita stock of aluminium in use in society i e in cars buildings electronics etc is kg lb much of this is in more developed countries kg lb per capita rather than less developed countries kg lb per capita bayer process bauxite is converted to alumina by the bayer process bauxite is blended for uniform composition and then is ground the resulting slurry is mixed with a hot solution of sodium hydroxide the mixture is then treated in a digester vessel at a pressure well above atmospheric dissolving the aluminium hydroxide in bauxite while converting impurities into relatively insoluble compounds after this reaction the slurry is at a temperature above its atmospheric boiling point it is cooled by removing steam as pressure is reduced the bauxite residue is separated from the solution and discarded the solution free of solids is seeded with small crystals of aluminium hydroxide this causes decomposition of the al oh ions to aluminium hydroxide after about half of aluminium has precipitated the mixture is sent to classifiers small crystals of aluminium hydroxide are collected to serve as seeding agents coarse particles are converted to alumina by heating the excess solution is removed by evaporation if needed purified and recycled hall h roult process the conversion of alumina to aluminium metal is achieved by the hall h roult process in this energy intensive process a solution of alumina in a molten and c and f mixture of cryolite na alf with calcium fluoride is electrolyzed to produce metallic aluminium the liquid aluminium metal sinks to the bottom of the solution and is tapped off and usually cast into large blocks called aluminium billets for further processing anodes of the electrolysis cell are made of carbon the most resistant material against fluoride corrosion and either bake at the process or are prebaked the former also called s derberg anodes are less power efficient and fumes released during baking are costly to collect which is why they are being replaced by prebaked anodes even though they save the power energy and labor to prebake the cathodes carbon for anodes should be preferably pure so that neither aluminium nor the electrolyte is contaminated with ash despite carbon s resistivity against corrosion it is still consumed at a rate of kg per each kilogram of produced aluminium cathodes are made of anthracite high purity for them is not required because impurities leach only very slowly the cathode is consumed at a rate of kg per each kilogram of produced aluminium a cell is usually terminated after years following a failure of the cathode the hall heroult process produces aluminium with a purity of above further purification can be done by the hoopes process this process involves the electrolysis of molten aluminium with a sodium barium and aluminium fluoride electrolyte the resulting aluminium has a purity of electric power represents about to of the cost of producing aluminium depending on the location of the smelter aluminium production consumes roughly of electricity generated in the united states because of this alternatives to the hall h roult process have been researched but none has turned out to be economically feasible recycling recovery of the metal through recycling has become an important task of the aluminium industry recycling was a low profile activity until the late s when the growing use of aluminium beverage cans brought it to public awareness recycling involves melting the scrap a process that requires only of the energy used to produce aluminium from ore though a significant part up to of the input material is lost as dross ash like oxide an aluminium stack melter produces significantly less dross with values reported below white dross from primary aluminium production and from secondary recycling operations still contains useful quantities of aluminium that can be extracted industrially the process produces aluminium billets together with a highly complex waste material this waste is difficult to manage it reacts with water releasing a mixture of gases including among others hydrogen acetylene and ammonia which spontaneously ignites on contact with air contact with damp air results in the release of copious quantities of ammonia gas despite these difficulties the waste is used as a filler in asphalt and concrete applications metal the global production of aluminium in was million metric tons it exceeded that of any other metal except iron million metric tons aluminium is almost always alloyed which markedly improves its mechanical properties especially when tempered for example the common aluminium foils and beverage cans are alloys of to aluminium the main alloying agents are copper zinc magnesium manganese and silicon e g duralumin with the levels of other metals in a few percent by weight aluminium both wrought and cast has been alloyed with manganese silicon magnesium copper and zinc among others for example the kynal family of alloys was developed by the british chemical manufacturer imperial chemical industries the major uses for aluminium metal are in transportation automobiles aircraft trucks railway cars marine vessels bicycles spacecraft etc aluminium is used because of its low density packaging cans foil frame etc aluminium is used because it is non toxic see below non adsorptive and splinter proof building and construction windows doors siding building wire sheathing roofing etc since steel is cheaper aluminium is used when lightness corrosion resistance or engineering features are important electricity related uses conductor alloys motors and generators transformers capacitors etc aluminium is used because it is relatively cheap highly conductive has adequate mechanical strength and low density and resists corrosion a wide range of household items from cooking utensils to furniture low density good appearance ease of fabrication and durability are the key factors of aluminium usage machinery and equipment processing equipment pipes tools aluminium is used because of its corrosion resistance non pyrophoricity and mechanical strength portable computer cases currently rarely used without alloying but aluminium can be recycled and clean aluminium has residual market value for example the used beverage can ubc material was used to encase the electronic components of macbook air laptop pixel smartphone or summit lite smartwatch compounds the great majority about of aluminium oxide is converted to metallic aluminium being a very hard material mohs hardness alumina is widely used as an abrasive being extraordinarily chemically inert it is useful in highly reactive environments such as high pressure sodium lamps aluminium oxide is commonly used as a catalyst for industrial processes e g the claus process to convert hydrogen sulfide to sulfur in refineries and to alkylate amines many industrial catalysts are supported by alumina meaning that the expensive catalyst material is dispersed over a surface of the inert alumina another principal use is as a drying agent or absorbent several sulfates of aluminium have industrial and commercial application aluminium sulfate in its hydrate form is produced on the annual scale of several millions of metric tons about two thirds is consumed in water treatment the next major application is in the manufacture of paper it is also used as a mordant in dyeing in pickling seeds deodorizing of mineral oils in leather tanning and in production of other aluminium compounds two kinds of alum ammonium alum and potassium alum were formerly used as mordants and in leather tanning but their use has significantly declined following availability of high purity aluminium sulfate anhydrous aluminium chloride is used as a catalyst in chemical and petrochemical industries the dyeing industry and in synthesis of various inorganic and organic compounds aluminium hydroxychlorides are used in purifying water in the paper industry and as antiperspirants sodium aluminate is used in treating water and as an accelerator of solidification of cement many aluminium compounds have niche applications for example aluminium acetate in solution is used as an astringent aluminium phosphate is used in the manufacture of glass ceramic pulp and paper products cosmetics paints varnishes and in dental cement aluminium hydroxide is used as an antacid and mordant it is used also in water purification the manufacture of glass and ceramics and in the waterproofing of fabrics lithium aluminium hydride is a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry organoaluminiums are used as lewis acids and co catalysts methylaluminoxane is a co catalyst for ziegler natta olefin polymerization to produce vinyl polymers such as polyethene aqueous aluminium ions such as aqueous aluminium sulfate are used to treat against fish parasites such as gyrodactylus salaris in many vaccines certain aluminium salts serve as an immune adjuvant immune response booster to allow the protein in the vaccine to achieve sufficient potency as an immune stimulant aluminized substrates aluminizing is the process of coating a structure or material with a thin layer of aluminium it is done to impart specific traits that the underlying substrate lacks such as a certain chemical or physical property aluminized materials include aluminized steel for corrosion resistance and other properties aluminized screen for display devices aluminized cloth to reflect heat aluminized mylar to reflect heat biology despite its widespread occurrence in the earth s crust aluminium has no known function in biology at ph relevant for most natural waters aluminium precipitates out of water as the hydroxide and is hence not available most elements behaving this way have no biological role or are toxic aluminium sulfate has an ld of mg kg oral mouse which corresponds to grams for an kg lb person toxicity aluminium is classified as a non carcinogen by the united states department of health and human services a review published in said that there was little evidence that normal exposure to aluminium presents a risk to healthy adult and a multi element toxicology review was unable to find deleterious effects of aluminium consumed in amounts not greater than mg day per kg of body mass most aluminium consumed will leave the body in feces most of the small part of it that enters the bloodstream will be excreted via urine nevertheless some aluminium does pass the blood brain barrier and is lodged preferentially in the brains of alzheimer s patients evidence published in indicates that for alzheimer s patients aluminium may act by electrostatically crosslinking proteins thus down regulating genes in the superior temporal gyrus effects aluminium although rarely can cause vitamin d resistant osteomalacia erythropoietin resistant microcytic anemia and central nervous system alterations people with kidney insufficiency are especially at a risk chronic ingestion of hydrated aluminium silicates for excess gastric acidity control may result in aluminium binding to intestinal contents and increased elimination of other metals such as iron or zinc sufficiently high doses g day can cause anemia during the camelford water pollution incident people in camelford had their drinking water contaminated with aluminium sulfate for several weeks a final report into the incident in concluded it was unlikely that this had caused long term health problems aluminium has been suspected of being a possible cause of alzheimer s disease but research into this for over years has found as of no good evidence of causal effect aluminium increases estrogen related gene expression in human breast cancer cells cultured in the laboratory in very high doses aluminium is associated with altered function of the blood brain barrier a small percentage of people have contact allergies to aluminium and experience itchy red rashes headache muscle pain joint pain poor memory insomnia depression asthma irritable bowel syndrome or other symptoms upon contact with products containing aluminium exposure to powdered aluminium or aluminium welding fumes can cause pulmonary fibrosis fine aluminium powder can ignite or explode posing another workplace hazard exposure routes food is the main source of aluminium drinking water contains more aluminium than solid food however aluminium in food may be absorbed more than aluminium from water major sources of human oral exposure to aluminium include food due to its use in food additives food and beverage packaging and cooking utensils drinking water due to its use in municipal water treatment and aluminium containing medications particularly antacid antiulcer and buffered aspirin formulations dietary exposure in europeans averages to mg kg week but can be as high as mg kg week higher exposure levels of aluminium are mostly limited to miners aluminium production workers and dialysis patients consumption of antacids antiperspirants vaccines and cosmetics provide possible routes of exposure consumption of acidic foods or liquids with aluminium enhances aluminium absorption and maltol has been shown to increase the accumulation of aluminium in nerve and bone tissues treatment in case of suspected sudden intake of a large amount of aluminium the only treatment is deferoxamine mesylate which may be given to help eliminate aluminium from the body by chelation however this should be applied with caution as this reduces not only aluminium body levels but also those of other metals such as copper or iron environmental effects high levels of aluminium occur near mining sites small amounts of aluminium are released to the environment at the coal fired power plants or incinerators aluminium in the air is washed out by the rain or normally settles down but small particles of aluminium remain in the air for a long time acidic precipitation is the main natural factor to mobilize aluminium from natural sources and the main reason for the environmental effects of aluminium however the main factor of presence of aluminium in salt and freshwater are the industrial processes that also release aluminium into air in water aluminium acts as a toxi agent on gill breathing animals such as fish when the water is acidic in which aluminium may precipitate on gills which causes loss of plasma and hemolymph ions leading to osmoregulatory failure organic complexes of aluminium may be easily absorbed and interfere with metabolism in mammals and birds even though this rarely happens in practice aluminium is primary among the factors that reduce plant growth on acidic soils although it is generally harmless to plant growth in ph neutral soils in acid soils the concentration of toxic al cations increases and disturbs root growth and function wheat has developed a tolerance to aluminium releasing organic compounds that bind to harmful aluminium cations sorghum is believed to have the same tolerance mechanism aluminium production possesses its own challenges to the environment on each step of the production process the major challenge is the greenhouse gas emissions these gases result from electrical consumption of the smelters and the byproducts of processing the most potent of these gases are perfluorocarbons from the smelting process released sulfur dioxide is one of the primary precursors of acid rain biodegradation of metallic aluminium is extremely rare most aluminium corroding organisms do not directly attack or consume the aluminium but instead produce corrosive wastes the fungus geotrichum candidum can consume the aluminium in compact discs the bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa and the fungus cladosporium resinae are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene based fuels not avgas and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium ,13
Silicon,Si,silicon is a chemical element with the symbol si and atomic number it is a hard brittle crystalline solid with a blue grey metallic luster and is a tetravalent metalloid and semiconductor it is a member of group in the periodic table carbon is above it and germanium tin lead and flerovium are below it it is relatively unreactive because of its high chemical affinity for oxygen it was not until that j ns jakob berzelius was first able to prepare it and characterize it in pure form its oxides form a family of anions known as silicates its melting and boiling points of c and c respectively are the second highest among all the metalloids and nonmetals being surpassed only by boron silicon is the eighth most common element in the universe by mass but very rarely occurs as the pure element in the earth s crust it is widely distributed in space in cosmic dusts planetoids and planets as various forms of silicon dioxide silica or silicates more than of the earth s crust is composed of silicate minerals making silicon the second most abundant element in the earth s crust about by mass after oxygen most silicon is used commercially without being separated often with very little processing of the natural minerals such use includes industrial construction with clays silica sand and stone silicates are used in portland cement for mortar and stucco and mixed with silica sand and gravel to make concrete for walkways foundations and roads they are also used in whiteware ceramics such as porcelain and in traditional silicate based soda lime glass and many other specialty glasses silicon compounds such as silicon carbide are used as abrasives and components of high strength ceramics silicon is the basis of the widely used synthetic polymers called silicones the late th century to early st century has been described as the silicon age also known as the digital age or information age because of the large impact that elemental silicon has on the modern world economy the small portion of very highly purified elemental silicon used in semiconductor electronics is essential to the transistors and integrated circuit chips used in most modern technology such as smartphones and other computers in of the semiconductor market segment was for networks and communications devices and the semiconductors industry is projected to reach billion by silicon is an essential element in biology only traces are required by most animals but some sea sponges and microorganisms such as diatoms and radiolaria secrete skeletal structures made of silica silica is deposited in many plant tissues history owing to the abundance of silicon in the earth s crust natural silicon based materials have been used for thousands of years silicon rock crystals were familiar to various ancient civilizations such as the predynastic egyptians who used it for beads and small vases as well as the ancient chinese glass containing silica was manufactured by the egyptians since at least bc as well as by the ancient phoenicians natural silicate compounds were also used in various types of mortar for construction of early human dwellings discovery in antoine lavoisier suspected that silica might be an oxide of a fundamental chemical element but the chemical affinity of silicon for oxygen is high enough that he had no means to reduce the oxide and isolate the element after an attempt to isolate silicon in sir humphry davy proposed the name silicium for silicon from the latin silex silicis for flint and adding the ium ending because he believed it to be a metal most other languages use transliterated forms of davy s name sometimes adapted to local phonology e g german silizium turkish silisyum catalan silici armenian or silitzioum a few others use instead a calque of the latin root e g russian from flint greek from fire finnish pii from piikivi flint czech k em k from k emen quartz flint gay lussac and th nard are thought to have prepared impure amorphous silicon in through the heating of recently isolated potassium metal with silicon tetrafluoride but they did not purify and characterize the product nor identify it as a new element silicon was given its present name in by scottish chemist thomas thomson he retained part of davy s name but added on because he believed that silicon was a nonmetal similar to boron and carbon in j ns jacob berzelius prepared amorphous silicon using approximately the same method as gay lussac reducing potassium fluorosilicate with molten potassium metal but purifying the product to a brown powder by repeatedly washing it as a result he is usually given credit for the element s discovery the same year berzelius became the first to prepare silicon tetrachloride silicon tetrafluoride had already been prepared long before in by carl wilhelm scheele by dissolving silica in hydrofluoric acid silicon in its more common crystalline form was not prepared until years later by deville by electrolyzing a mixture of sodium chloride and aluminium chloride containing approximately silicon he was able to obtain a slightly impure allotrope of silicon in later more cost effective methods have been developed to isolate several allotrope forms the most recent being silicene in meanwhile research on the chemistry of silicon continued friedrich w hler discovered the first volatile hydrides of silicon synthesising trichlorosilane in and silane itself in but a detailed investigation of the silanes was only carried out in the early th century by alfred stock despite early speculation on the matter dating as far back as the beginnings of synthetic organic chemistry in the s similarly the first organosilicon compound tetraethylsilane was synthesised by charles friedel and james crafts in but detailed characterisation of organosilicon chemistry was only done in the early th century by frederic kipping starting in the s the work of william lawrence bragg on x ray crystallography successfully elucidated the compositions of the silicates which had previously been known from analytical chemistry but had not yet been understood together with linus pauling s development of crystal chemistry and victor goldschmidt s development of geochemistry the middle of the th century saw the development of the chemistry and industrial use of siloxanes and the growing use of silicone polymers elastomers and resins in the late th century the complexity of the crystal chemistry of silicides was mapped along with the solid state physics of doped semiconductors silicon semiconductors the first semiconductor devices did not use silicon but used galena including german physicist ferdinand braun s crystal detector in and indian physicist jagadish chandra bose s radio crystal detector in the first silicon semiconductor device was a silicon radio crystal detector developed by american engineer greenleaf whittier pickard in in russell ohl discovered the p n junction and photovoltaic effects in silicon in techniques for producing high purity germanium and silicon crystals were developed for radar microwave detector crystals during world war ii in physicist william shockley theorized a field effect amplifier made from germanium and silicon but he failed to build a working device before eventually working with germanium instead the first working transistor was a point contact transistor built by john bardeen and walter brattain later that year while working under shockley in physical chemist morris tanenbaum fabricated the first silicon junction transistor at bell labs in carl frosch and lincoln derick at bell labs accidentally discovered that silicon dioxide sio could be grown on silicon and they later proposed this could mask silicon surfaces during diffusion processes in silicon age the silicon age refers to the late th century to early st century this is due to silicon being the dominant material of the silicon age also known as the digital age or information age similar to how the stone age bronze age and iron age were defined by the dominant materials during their respective ages of civilization because silicon is an important element in high technology semiconductor devices many places in the world bear its name for example santa clara valley in california acquired the nickname silicon valley as the element is the base material in the semiconductor industry there since then many other places have been dubbed similarly including silicon wadi in israel silicon forest in oregon silicon hills in austin texas silicon slopes in salt lake city utah silicon saxony in germany silicon valley in india silicon border in mexicali mexico silicon fen in cambridge england silicon roundabout in london silicon glen in scotland silicon gorge in bristol england silicon alley in new york new york and silicon beach in los angeles california characteristics physical and atomic a silicon atom has fourteen electrons in the ground state they are arranged in the electron configuration ne s p of these four are valence electrons occupying the s orbital and two of the p orbitals like the other members of its group the lighter carbon and the heavier germanium tin and lead it has the same number of valence electrons as valence orbitals hence it can complete its octet and obtain the stable noble gas configuration of argon by forming sp hybrid orbitals forming tetrahedral six derivatives where the central silicon atom shares an electron pair with each of the four atoms it is bonded to the first four ionisation energies of silicon are and kj mol respectively these figures are high enough to preclude the possibility of simple cationic chemistry for the element following periodic trends its single bond covalent radius of pm is intermediate between those of carbon pm and germanium pm the hexacoordinate ionic radius of silicon may be considered to be pm although this must be taken as a purely notional figure given the lack of a simple si cation in reality electrical at standard temperature and pressure silicon is a shiny semiconductor with a bluish grey metallic lustre as typical for semiconductors its resistivity drops as temperature rises this arises because silicon has a small energy gap band gap between its highest occupied energy levels the valence band and the lowest unoccupied ones the conduction band the fermi level is about halfway between the valence and conduction bands and is the energy at which a state is as likely to be occupied by an electron as not hence pure silicon is effectively an insulator at room temperature however doping silicon with a pnictogen such as phosphorus arsenic or antimony introduces one extra electron per dopant and these may then be excited into the conduction band either thermally or photolytically creating an n type semiconductor similarly doping silicon with a group element such as boron aluminium or gallium results in the introduction of acceptor levels that trap electrons that may be excited from the filled valence band creating a p type semiconductor joining n type silicon to p type silicon creates a p n junction with a common fermi level electrons flow from n to p while holes flow from p to n creating a voltage drop this p n junction thus acts as a diode that can rectify alternating current that allows current to pass more easily one way than the other a transistor is an n p n junction with a thin layer of weakly p type silicon between two n type regions biasing the emitter through a small forward voltage and the collector through a large reverse voltage allows the transistor to act as a triode amplifier crystal structure silicon crystallises in a giant covalent structure at standard conditions specifically in a diamond cubic lattice space group it thus has a high melting point of c as a lot of energy is required to break the strong covalent bonds and melt the solid upon melting silicon contracts as the long range tetrahedral network of bonds breaks up and the voids in that network are filled in similar to water ice when hydrogen bonds are broken upon melting it does not have any thermodynamically stable allotropes at standard pressure but several other crystal structures are known at higher pressures the general trend is one of increasing coordination number with pressure culminating in a hexagonal close packed allotrope at about gigapascals known as si vii the standard modification being si i an allotrope called bc or bc having a body centred cubic lattice with eight atoms per primitive unit cell space group can be created at high pressure and remains metastable at low pressure its properties have been studied in detail silicon boils at c this while high is still lower than the temperature at which its lighter congener carbon sublimes c and silicon similarly has a lower heat of vaporisation than carbon consistent with the fact that the si si bond is weaker than the c c bond it is also possible to construct silicene layers analogous to graphene isotopes naturally occurring silicon is composed of three stable isotopes si si and si out of these only si is of use in nmr and epr spectroscopy as it is the only one with a nuclear spin i all three are produced in type ia supernovae through the oxygen burning process with si being made as part of the alpha process and hence the most abundant the fusion of si with alpha particles by photodisintegration rearrangement in stars is known as the silicon burning process it is the last stage of stellar nucleosynthesis before the rapid collapse and violent explosion of the star in question in a type ii supernova twenty radioisotopes have been characterized the two stablest being si with a half life of about years and si with a half life of hours all the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are less than seven seconds and the majority of these have half lives that are less than one tenth of a second silicon has one known nuclear isomer msi with a half life less than nanoseconds si undergoes low energy beta decay to p and then stable s si may be produced by the neutron activation of natural silicon and is thus useful for quantitative analysis it can be easily detected by its characteristic beta decay to stable p in which the emitted electron carries up to mev of energy the known isotopes of silicon range in mass number from to the most common decay mode of the isotopes with mass numbers lower than the three stable isotopes is inverse beta decay primarily forming aluminium isotopes protons as decay products the most common decay mode for the heavier unstable isotopes is beta decay primarily forming phosphorus isotopes protons as decay products silicon can enter the oceans through groundwater and riverine transport large fluxes of groundwater input have an isotopic composition which is distinct from riverine silicon inputs isotopic variations in groundwater and riverine transports contribute to variations in oceanic si values currently there are substantial differences in the isotopic values of deep water in the world s ocean basins between the atlantic and pacific oceans there is a deep water si gradient of greater than parts per thousand si is most commonly associated with productivity in the oceans chemistry and compounds crystalline bulk silicon is rather inert but becomes more reactive at high temperatures like its neighbour aluminium silicon forms a thin continuous surface layer of silicon dioxide sio that protects the metal from oxidation thus silicon does not measurably react with the air below c but formation of the vitreous dioxide rapidly increases between c and c and when c is reached atmospheric nitrogen also reacts to give the nitrides sin and si n silicon reacts with gaseous sulfur at c and gaseous phosphorus at c this oxide layer nevertheless does not prevent reaction with the halogens fluorine attacks silicon vigorously at room temperature chlorine does so at about c and bromine and iodine at about c silicon does not react with most aqueous acids but is oxidised and complexed by hydrofluoric acid mixtures containing either chlorine or nitric acid to form hexafluorosilicates it readily dissolves in hot aqueous alkali to form silicates at high temperatures silicon also reacts with alkyl halides this reaction may be catalysed by copper to directly synthesise organosilicon chlorides as precursors to silicone polymers upon melting silicon becomes extremely reactive alloying with most metals to form silicides and reducing most metal oxides because the heat of formation of silicon dioxide is so large in fact molten silicon reacts virtually with every known kind of crucible material except its own oxide sio this happens due to silicon s high binding forces for the light elements and to its high dissolving power for most elements as a result containers for liquid silicon must be made of refractory unreactive materials such as zirconium dioxide or group and borides tetrahedral coordination is a major structural motif in silicon chemistry just as it is for carbon chemistry however the p subshell is rather more diffuse than the p subshell and does not hybridise so well with the s subshell as a result the chemistry of silicon and its heavier congeners shows significant differences from that of carbon and thus octahedral coordination is also significant for example the electronegativity of silicon is much less than that of carbon because the valence electrons of silicon are further from the nucleus than those of carbon and hence experience smaller electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus the poor overlap of p orbitals also results in a much lower tendency toward catenation formation of si si bonds for silicon than for carbon due to the concomitant weakening of the si si bond compared to the c c bond the average si si bond energy is approximately kj mol compared to a value of kj mol for the c c bond this results in multiply bonded silicon compounds generally being much less stable than their carbon counterparts an example of the double bond rule on the other hand the presence of radial nodes in the p orbitals of silicon suggests the possibility of hypervalence as seen in five and six coordinate derivatives of silicon such as six and sif lastly because of the increasing energy gap between the valence s and p orbitals as the group is descended the divalent state grows in importance from carbon to lead so that a few unstable divalent compounds are known for silicon this lowering of the main oxidation state in tandem with increasing atomic radii results in an increase of metallic character down the group silicon already shows some incipient metallic behavior particularly in the behavior of its oxide compounds and its reaction with acids as well as bases though this takes some effort and is hence often referred to as a metalloid rather than a nonmetal however metallicity does not become clear in group until germanium and dominant until tin with the growing importance of the lower oxidation state silicon shows clear differences from carbon for example organic chemistry has very few analogies with silicon chemistry while silicate minerals have a structural complexity unseen in oxocarbons silicon tends to resemble germanium far more than it does carbon and this resemblance is enhanced by the d block contraction resulting in the size of the germanium atom being much closer to that of the silicon atom than periodic trends would predict nevertheless there are still some differences because of the growing importance of the divalent state in germanium compared to silicon which result in germanium being significantly more metallic than silicon additionally the lower ge o bond strength compared to the si o bond strength results in the absence of germanone polymers that would be analogous to silicone polymers silicides many metal silicides are known most of which have formulae that cannot be explained through simple appeals to valence their bonding ranges from metallic to ionic and covalent some known stoichiometries are m si m si m si m si m si m si m si m si m si msi m si msi msi and msi they are structurally more similar to the borides than the carbides in keeping with the diagonal relationship between boron and silicon although the larger size of silicon than boron means that exact structural analogies are few and far between the heats of formation of the silicides are usually similar to those of the borides and carbides of the same elements but they usually melt at lower temperatures silicides are known for all stable elements in groups with the exception of beryllium in particular uranium and the transition metals of groups show the widest range of stoichiometries except for copper the metals in groups do not form silicides instead most form eutectic mixtures although the heaviest post transition metals mercury thallium lead and bismuth are completely immiscible with liquid silicon usually silicides are prepared by direct reaction of the elements for example the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals react with silicon or silicon oxide to give silicides nevertheless even with these highly electropositive elements true silicon anions are not obtainable and most of these compounds are semiconductors for example the alkali metal silicides m si contain pyramidal tricoordinate silicon in the si anion isoelectronic with white phosphorus p metal rich silicides tend to have isolated silicon atoms e g cu si with increasing silicon content catenation increases resulting in isolated clusters of two e g u si or four silicon atoms e g k si at first followed by chains e g casi layers e g casi or three dimensional networks of silicon atoms spanning space e g thsi as the silicon content rises even higher the silicides of the group and metals usually are more reactive than the transition metal silicides the latter usually do not react with aqueous reagents except for hydrofluoric acid however they do react with much more aggressive reagents such as liquid potassium hydroxide or gaseous fluorine or chlorine when red hot the pre transition metal silicides instead readily react with water and aqueous acids usually producing hydrogen or silanes na si h o na sio h mg si h so mgso sih products often vary with the stoichiometry of the silicide reactant for example ca si is polar and non conducting and has the anti pbcl structure with single isolated silicon atoms and reacts with water to produce calcium hydroxide hydrated silicon dioxide and hydrogen gas casi with its zigzag chains of silicon atoms instead reacts to give silanes and polymeric sih while casi with its puckered layers of silicon atoms does not react with water but will react with dilute hydrochloric acid the product is a yellow polymeric solid with stoichiometry si h o silanes speculation on silicon hydride chemistry started in the s contemporary with the development of synthetic organic chemistry silane itself as well as trichlorosilane were first synthesised by friedrich w hler and heinrich buff in by reacting aluminium silicon alloys with hydrochloric acid and characterised as sih and sihcl by charles friedel and albert ladenburg in disilane si h followed in when it was first made by henri moissan and samuel smiles by the protonolysis of magnesium silicides further investigation had to wait until because of the great reactivity and thermal instability of the silanes it was then that alfred stock began to study silicon hydrides in earnest with new greaseless vacuum techniques as they were found as contaminants of his focus the boron hydrides the names silanes and boranes are his based on analogy with the alkanes the moissan and smiles method of preparation of silanes and silane derivatives via protonolysis of metal silicides is still used although the yield is lowered by the hydrolysis of the products that occurs simultaneously so that the preferred route today is to treat substituted silanes with hydride reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride in etheric solutions at low temperatures direct reaction of hx or rx with silicon possibly with a catalyst such as copper is also a viable method of producing substituted silanes the silanes comprise a homologous series of silicon hydrides with a general formula of sinh n they are all strong reducing agents unbranched and branched chains are known up to n and the cycles si h and si h are also known the first two silane and disilane are colourless gases the heavier members of the series are volatile liquids all silanes are very reactive and catch fire or explode spontaneously in air they become less thermally stable with room temperature so that only silane is indefinitely stable at room temperature although disilane does not decompose very quickly only of a sample decomposes after the passage of eight months they decompose to form polymeric polysilicon hydride and hydrogen gas as expected from the difference in atomic weight the silanes are less volatile than the corresponding alkanes and boranes but more so than the corresponding germanes they are much more reactive than the corresponding alkanes because of the larger radius of silicon compared to carbon facilitating nucleophilic attack at the silicon the greater polarity of the si h bond compared to the c h bond and the ability of silicon to expand its octet and hence form adducts and lower the reaction s activation energy silane pyrolysis gives polymeric species and finally elemental silicon and hydrogen indeed ultrapure silicon is commercially produced by the pyrolysis of silane while the thermal decomposition of alkanes starts by the breaking of a c h or c c bond and the formation of radical intermediates polysilanes decompose by eliminating silylenes sih or sihr as the activation energy of this process kj mol is much less than the si si and si h bond energies while pure silanes do not react with pure water or dilute acids traces of alkali catalyse immediate hydrolysis to hydrated silicon dioxide if the reaction is carried out in methanol controlled solvolysis results in the products sih ome sih ome and si ome the si h bond also adds to alkenes a reaction which proceeds slowly and speeds up with increasing substitution of the silane involved at c silane participates in an addition reaction with acetone as well as a ring opening reaction with ethylene oxide direct reaction of the silanes with chlorine or bromine results in explosions at room temperature but the reaction of silane with bromine at c is controlled and yields bromosilane and dibromosilane the monohalosilanes may be formed by reacting silane with the appropriate hydrogen halide with an al x catalyst or by reacting silane with a solid silver halide in a heated flow reactor sih agcl c sih cl hcl agamong the derivatives of silane iodosilane sih i and potassium silanide ksih are very useful synthetic intermediates in the production of more complicated silicon containing compounds the latter is a colourless crystalline ionic solid containing k cations and sih anions in the nacl structure and is made by the reduction of silane by potassium metal additionally the reactive hypervalent species sih is also known with suitable organic substituents it is possible to produce stable polysilanes they have surprisingly high electric conductivities arising from sigma delocalisation of the electrons in the chain halides silicon and silicon carbide readily react with all four stable halogens forming the colourless reactive and volatile silicon tetrahalides silicon tetrafluoride also may be made by fluorinating the other silicon halides and is produced by the attack of hydrofluoric acid on glass heating two different tetrahalides together also produces a random mixture of mixed halides which may also be produced by halogen exchange reactions the melting and boiling points of these species usually rise with increasing atomic weight though there are many exceptions for example the melting and boiling points drop as one passes from sifbr through sifclbr to sifcl br the shift from the hypoelectronic elements in group and earlier to the group elements is illustrated by the change from an infinite ionic structure in aluminium fluoride to a lattice of simple covalent silicon tetrafluoride molecules as dictated by the lower electronegativity of aluminium than silicon the stoichiometry the oxidation state being too high for true ionicity and the smaller size of the silicon atom compared to the aluminium atom silicon tetrachloride is manufactured on a huge scale as a precursor to the production of pure silicon silicon dioxide and some silicon esters the silicon tetrahalides hydrolyse readily in water unlike the carbon tetrahalides again because of the larger size of the silicon atom rendering it more open to nucleophilic attack and the ability of the silicon atom to expand its octet which carbon lacks the reaction of silicon tetrafluoride with excess hydrofluoric acid produces the octahedral hexafluorosilicate anion sif analogous to the silanes halopolysilanes sinx n also are known while catenation in carbon compounds is maximised in the hydrogen compounds rather than the halides the opposite is true for silicon so that the halopolysilanes are known up to at least si f si cl and si br a suggested explanation for this phenomenon is the compensation for the electron loss of silicon to the more electronegative halogen atoms by pi backbonding from the filled p orbitals on the halogen atoms to the empty d orbitals on silicon this is similar to the situation of carbon monoxide in metal carbonyl complexes and explains their stability these halopolysilanes may be produced by comproportionation of silicon tetrahalides with elemental silicon or by condensation of lighter halopolysilanes trimethylammonium being a useful catalyst for this reaction silica silicon dioxide sio also known as silica is one of the best studied compounds second only to water twelve different crystal modifications of silica are known the most common being quartz a major constituent of many rocks such as granite and sandstone it also is known to occur in a pure form as rock crystal impure forms are known as rose quartz smoky quartz morion amethyst and citrine some poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known such as chalcedony chrysoprase carnelian agate onyx jasper heliotrope and flint other modifications of silicon dioxide are known in some other minerals such as tridymite and cristobalite as well as the much less common coesite and stishovite biologically generated forms are also known as kieselguhr and diatomaceous earth vitreous silicon dioxide is known as tektites and obsidian and rarely as lechatelierite some synthetic forms are known as keatite opals are composed of complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon dioxide most crystalline forms of silica are made of infinite arrangements of sio tetrahedra with si at the center connected at their corners with each oxygen atom linked to two silicon atoms in the thermodynamically stable room temperature form quartz these tetrahedra are linked in intertwined helical chains with two different si o distances and pm with a si o si angle of these helices can be either left or right handed so that individual quartz crystals are optically active at c this transforms quickly and reversibly into the similar quartz with a change of the si o si angle to but a retention of handedness further heating to c results in another reversible phase transition to tridymite in which some si o bonds are broken to allow for the arrangement of the sio tetrahedra into a more open and less dense hexagonal structure this transition is slow and hence tridymite occurs as a metastable mineral even below this transition temperature when cooled to about c it quickly and reversibly transforms by slight displacements of individual silicon and oxygen atoms to tridymite similarly to the transition from quartz to quartz tridymite slowly transforms to cubic cristobalite at about c which once again exists metastably below this transition temperature and transforms at c to cristobalite via small atomic displacements cristobalite melts at c the freezing of silica from the melt is quite slow and vitrification or the formation of a glass is likely to occur instead in vitreous silica the sio tetrahedra remain corner connected but the symmetry and periodicity of the crystalline forms are lost because of the slow conversions between these three forms it is possible upon rapid heating to melt quartz c or tridymite c silica boils at approximately c other high pressure forms of silica are known such as coesite and stishovite these are known in nature formed under the shock pressure of a meteorite impact and then rapidly quenched to preserve the crystal structure similar melting and cooling of silica occurs following lightning strikes forming glassy lechatelierite w silica is an unstable low density form involving sio tetrahedra sharing opposite edges instead of corners forming parallel chains similarly to silicon disulfide sis and silicon diselenide sise it quickly returns to forming amorphous silica with heat or traces of water silica is rather inert chemically it is not attacked by any acids other than hydrofluoric acid however it slowly dissolves in hot concentrated alkalis and does so rather quickly in fused metal hydroxides or carbonates to give metal silicates among the elements it is attacked only by fluorine at room temperature to form silicon tetrafluoride hydrogen and carbon also react but require temperatures over c to do so silica nevertheless reacts with many metal and metalloid oxides to form a wide variety of compounds important in the glass and ceramic industries above all but also have many other uses for example sodium silicate is often used in detergents due to its buffering saponifying and emulsifying properties silicic acids adding water to silica drops its melting point by around c due to the breaking of the structure by replacing si o si linkages with terminating si oh groups increasing water concentration results in the formation of hydrated silica gels and colloidal silica dispersions many hydrates and silicic acids exist in the most dilute of aqueous solutions but these are rather insoluble and quickly precipitate and condense and cross link to form various polysilicic acids of variable combinations following the formula siox oh x n similar to the behaviour of boron aluminium and iron among other elements hence although some simple silicic acids have been identified in dilute solutions such as orthosilicic acid si oh and metasilicic acid sio oh none of these are likely to exist in the solid state silicate minerals about of the earth s crustal rocks are made of silica or silicate and aluminosilicate minerals as reflected in oxygen silicon and aluminium being the three most common elements in the crust in that order measured by mass silicon makes up of the earth s crust pure silicon crystals are very rarely found in nature but notable exceptions are crystals as large as to mm across found during sampling gases from the kudriavy volcano on iturup one of the kuril islands silicate and aluminosilicate minerals have many different structures and varying stoichiometry but they may be classified following some general principles tetrahedral sio units are common to almost all these compounds either as discrete structures or combined into larger units by the sharing of corner oxygen atoms these may be divided into neso silicates discrete sio units sharing no oxygen atoms soro silicates discrete si o units sharing one cyclo silicates closed ring structures and ino silicates continuous chain or ribbon structures both sharing two phyllo silicates continuous sheets sharing three and tecto silicates continuous three dimensional frameworks sharing four the lattice of oxygen atoms that results is usually close packed or close to it with the charge being balanced by other cations in various different polyhedral sites according to size the orthosilicates mii sio m be mg mn fe zn and zrsio are neso silicates be sio phenacite is unusual as both beii and siiv occupy tetrahedral four coordinated sites the other divalent cations instead occupy six coordinated octahedral sites and often isomorphously replace each other as in olivine mg fe mn sio zircon zrsio demands eight coordination of the zriv cations due to stoichiometry and because of their larger ionic radius pm also significant are the garnets mii miii sio in which the divalent cations e g ca mg fe are eight coordinated and the trivalent ones are six coordinated e g al cr fe regular coordination is not always present for example it is not found in ca sio which mixes six and eight coordinate sites for caii soro silicates involving discrete double or triple tetrahedral units are quite rare metasilicates involving cyclic sio n n units of corner abutting tetrahedra forming a polygonal ring are also known chain metasilicates sio form by corner sharing of an indefinite chain of linked sio tetrahedra many differences arise due to the differing repeat distances of conformation across the line of tetrahedra a repeat distance of two is most common as in most pyroxene minerals but repeat distances of one three four five six seven nine and twelve are also known these chains may then link across each other to form double chains and ribbons as in the asbestos minerals involving repeated chains of cyclic tetrahedron rings layer silicates such as the clay minerals and the micas are very common and often are formed by horizontal cross linking of metasilicate chains or planar condensation of smaller units an example is kaolinite al oh si o in many of these minerals cation and anion replacement is common so that for example tetrahedral siiv may be replaced by aliii octahedral aliii by mgii and oh by f three dimensional framework aluminosilicates are structurally very complex they may be conceived of as starting from the sio structure but having replaced up to one half of the siiv atoms with aliii they require more cations to be included in the structure to balance charge examples include feldspars the most abundant minerals on the earth zeolites and ultramarines many feldspars can be thought of as forming part of the ternary system naalsi o kalsi o caal si o their lattice is destroyed by high pressure prompting aliii to undergo six coordination rather than four coordination and this reaction destroying feldspars may be a reason for the mohorovi i discontinuity which would imply that the crust and mantle have the same chemical composition but different lattices although this is not a universally held view zeolites have many polyhedral cavities in their frameworks truncated cuboctahedra being most common but other polyhedra also are known as zeolite cavities allowing them to include loosely bound molecules such as water in their structure ultramarines alternate silicon and aluminium atoms and include a variety of other anions such as cl so and s but are otherwise similar to the feldspars other inorganic compounds silicon disulfide sis is formed by burning silicon in gaseous sulfur at c sublimation of the resulting compound in nitrogen results in white flexible long fibers reminiscent of asbestos with a structure similar to w silica this melts at c and sublimes at c at high temperature and pressure this transforms to a crystal structure analogous to cristobalite however sis lacks the variety of structures of sio and quickly hydrolyses to silica and hydrogen sulfide it is also ammonolysed quickly and completely by liquid ammonia as follows to form an imide sis nh si nh nh shit reacts with the sulfides of sodium magnesium aluminium and iron to form metal thiosilicates reaction with ethanol results in tetraethylsilicate si oet and hydrogen sulfide ethylsilicate is useful as its controlled hydrolysis produces adhesive or film like forms of silica reacting hydrogen sulfide with silicon tetrahalides yields silicon thiohalides such as s sicl cyclic cl si s sicl and crystalline siscl despite the double bond rule stable organosilanethiones rr si s have been made thanks to the stabilising mechanism of intermolecular coordination via an amine group silicon nitride si n may be formed by directly reacting silicon with nitrogen above c but a more economical means of production is by heating silica and coke in a stream of nitrogen and hydrogen gas at c it would make a promising ceramic if not for the difficulty of working with and sintering it chemically it is near totally inert and even above c it keeps its strength shape and continues to be resistant to wear and corrosion it is very hard on the mohs hardness scale dissociates only at c at atm and is quite dense density g cm because of its compact structure similar to that of phenacite be sio a similar refractory material is si n o formed by heating silicon and silica at c in an argon stream containing nitrogen gas involving coordinate silicon and coordinate nitrogen alternating in puckered hexagonal tilings interlinked by non linear si o si linkages to each other reacting silyl halides with ammonia or alkylammonia derivatives in the gaseous phase or in ethanolic solution produces various volatile silylamides which are silicon analogues of the amines sih cl nh n sih nh cl sih br me nh sih nme me nh br sih i n h sih nn sih n h imany such compounds have been prepared the only known restriction being that the nitrogen is always tertiary and species containing the sih nh group are unstable at room temperature the stoichiometry around the nitrogen atom in compounds such as n sih is planar which has been attributed to a p d interaction between a lone pair on nitrogen and an empty d orbital on silicon similarly trisilylamines are weaker as ligands than their carbon analogues the tertiary amines although substitution of some sih groups by ch groups mitigates this weakness for example n sih does not form an adduct with bh at all while men sih and me nsih form adducts at low temperatures that decompose upon warming some silicon analogues of imines with a si n double bond are known the first found was but si n sibut which was discovered in silicon carbide sic was first made by edward goodrich acheson in who named it carborundum to reference its intermediate hardness and abrasive power between diamond an allotrope of carbon and corundum aluminium oxide he soon founded a company to manufacture it and today about one million tonnes are produced each year silicon carbide exists in about crystalline forms the polymorphism of sic is characterized by a large family of similar crystalline structures called polytypes they are variations of the same chemical compound that are identical in two dimensions and differ in the third thus they can be viewed as layers stacked in a certain sequence it is made industrially by reduction of quartz sand with excess coke or anthracite at c in an electric furnace sio c si co si c sicit is the most thermally stable binary silicon compound only decomposing through loss of silicon starting from around c it is resistant to most aqueous acids phosphoric acid being an exception it forms a protective layer of silicon dioxide on the surface and hence only oxidises appreciably in air above c removal of this layer by molten hydroxides or carbonates leads to quick oxidation silicon carbide is rapidly attacked by chlorine gas which forms sicl and carbon at c and sicl and ccl at c it is mostly used as an abrasive and a refractory material as it is chemically stable and very strong and it fractures to form a very sharp cutting edge it is also useful as an intrinsic semiconductor as well as an extrinsic semiconductor upon being doped in its diamond like behavior it serves as an illustration of the chemical similarity between carbon and silicon organosilicon compounds because the si c bond is close in strength to the c c bond organosilicon compounds tend to be markedly thermally and chemically stable for example tetraphenylsilane siph may be distilled in air even at its boiling point of c and so may its substituted derivatives ph sicl and ph sicl which boil at c and c respectively furthermore since carbon and silicon are chemical congeners organosilicon chemistry shows some significant similarities with carbon chemistry for example in the propensity of such compounds for catenation and forming multiple bonds however significant differences also arise since silicon is more electropositive than carbon bonds to more electronegative elements are generally stronger with silicon than with carbon and vice versa thus the si f bond is significantly stronger than even the c f bond and is one of the strongest single bonds while the si h bond is much weaker than the c h bond and is readily broken furthermore the ability of silicon to expand its octet is not shared by carbon and hence some organosilicon reactions have no organic analogues for example nucleophilic attack on silicon does not proceed by the sn or sn processes but instead goes through a negatively charged true pentacoordinate intermediate and appears like a substitution at a hindered tertiary atom this works for silicon unlike for carbon because the long si c bonds reduce the steric hindrance and the d orbital of silicon is geometrically unconstrained for nucleophilic attack unlike for example a c o antibonding orbital nevertheless despite these differences the mechanism is still often called sn at silicon for simplicity one of the most useful silicon containing groups is trimethylsilyl me si the si c bond connecting it to the rest of the molecule is reasonably strong allowing it to remain while the rest of the molecule undergoes reactions but is not so strong that it cannot be removed specifically when needed for example by the fluoride ion which is a very weak nucleophile for carbon compounds but a very strong one for organosilicon compounds it may be compared to acidic protons while trisilylmethyl is removed by hard nucleophiles instead of bases both removals usually promote elimination as a general rule while saturated carbon is best attacked by nucleophiles that are neutral compounds those based on nonmetals far down on the periodic table e g sulfur selenium or iodine or even both silicon is best attacked by charged nucleophiles particularly those involving such highly electronegative nonmetals as oxygen fluorine or chlorine for example enolates react at the carbon in haloalkanes but at the oxygen in silyl chlorides and when trimethylsilyl is removed from an organic molecule using hydroxide as a nucleophile the product of the reaction is not the silanol as one would expect from using carbon chemistry as an analogy because the siloxide is strongly nucleophilic and attacks the original molecule to yield the silyl ether hexamethyldisiloxane me si o conversely while the sn reaction is mostly unaffected by the presence of a partial positive charge at the carbon the analogous sn reaction at silicon is so affected thus for example the silyl triflates are so electrophilic that they react to times faster than silyl chlorides with oxygen containing nucleophiles trimethylsilyl triflate is in particular a very good lewis acid and is used to convert carbonyl compounds to acetals and silyl enol ethers reacting them together analogously to the aldol reaction si c bonds are commonly formed in three ways in the laboratory preparation is often carried out in small quantities by reacting tetrachlorosilane silicon tetrachloride with organolithium grignard or organoaluminium reagents or by catalytic addition of si h across c c double bonds the second route has the drawback of not being applicable to the most important silanes the methyl and phenyl silanes organosilanes are made industrially by directly reacting alkyl or aryl halides with silicon with by weight metallic copper as a catalyst standard organic reactions suffice to produce many derivatives the resulting organosilanes are often significantly more reactive than their carbon congeners readily undergoing hydrolysis ammonolysis alcoholysis and condensation to form cyclic oligomers or linear polymers silicone polymers the word silicone was first used by frederic kipping in he invented the word to illustrate the similarity of chemical formulae between ph sio and benzophenone ph co although he also stressed the lack of chemical resemblance due to the polymeric structure of ph sio which is not shared by ph co silicones may be considered analogous to mineral silicates in which the methyl groups of the silicones correspond to the isoelectronic o of the silicates they are quite stable to extreme temperatures oxidation and water and have useful dielectric antistick and antifoam properties furthermore they are resistant over long periods of time to ultraviolet radiation and weathering and are inert physiologically they are fairly unreactive but do react with concentrated solutions bearing the hydroxide ion and fluorinating agents and occasionally may even be used as mild reagents for selective syntheses for example me si o is valuable for the preparation of derivatives of molybdenum and tungsten oxyhalides converting a tungsten hexachloride suspension in dichloroethane solution quantitatively to wocl in under an hour at room temperature and then to yellow wo cl at c in light petroleum at a yield of overnight occurrence silicon is the eighth most abundant element in the universe coming after hydrogen helium carbon nitrogen oxygen iron and neon these abundances are not replicated well on earth due to substantial separation of the elements taking place during the formation of the solar system silicon makes up of the earth s crust by weight second only to oxygen at with which it always is associated in nature further fractionation took place in the formation of the earth by planetary differentiation earth s core which makes up of the mass of the earth has approximate composition fe ni co s the mantle makes up of the earth s mass and is composed mostly of denser oxides and silicates an example being olivine mg fe sio while the lighter siliceous minerals such as aluminosilicates rise to the surface and form the crust making up of the earth s mass the crystallisation of igneous rocks from magma depends on a number of factors among them are the chemical composition of the magma the cooling rate and some properties of the individual minerals to be formed such as lattice energy melting point and complexity of their crystal structure as magma is cooled olivine appears first followed by pyroxene amphibole biotite mica orthoclase feldspar muscovite mica quartz zeolites and finally hydrothermal minerals this sequence shows a trend toward increasingly complex silicate units with cooling and the introduction of hydroxide and fluoride anions in addition to oxides many metals may substitute for silicon after these igneous rocks undergo weathering transport and deposition sedimentary rocks like clay shale and sandstone are formed metamorphism also may occur at high temperatures and pressures creating an even vaster variety of minerals there are four sources for silicon fluxes into the ocean include chemical weathering of continental rocks river transport dissolution of continental terrigenous silicates and through the reaction between submarine basalts and hydrothermal fluid which release dissolved silicon all four of these fluxes are interconnected in the ocean s biogeochemical cycle as they all were initially formed from the weathering of earth s crust approximately megatonnes of aeolian dust is deposited into the world s oceans each year of that value megatonnes are in the form of particulate silicon the total amount of particulate silicon deposition into the ocean is still less than the amount of silicon influx into the ocean via riverine transportation aeolian inputs of particulate lithogenic silicon into the north atlantic and western north pacific oceans are the result of dust settling on the oceans from the sahara and gobi desert respectively riverine transports are the major source of silicon influx into the ocean in coastal regions while silicon deposition in the open ocean is greatly influenced by the settling of aeolian dust production silicon of purity is made by reducing quartzite or sand with highly pure coke the reduction is carried out in an electric arc furnace with an excess of sio used to stop silicon carbide sic from accumulating sio c si co sic sio si co this reaction known as carbothermal reduction of silicon dioxide usually is conducted in the presence of scrap iron with low amounts of phosphorus and sulfur producing ferrosilicon ferrosilicon an iron silicon alloy that contains varying ratios of elemental silicon and iron accounts for about of the world s production of elemental silicon with china the leading supplier of elemental silicon providing million tonnes or rds of world output of silicon most of it in the form of ferrosilicon it is followed by russia t norway t brazil t and the united states t ferrosilicon is primarily used by the iron and steel industry see below with primary use as alloying addition in iron or steel and for de oxidation of steel in integrated steel plants another reaction sometimes used is aluminothermal reduction of silicon dioxide as follows sio al si al o leaching powdered pure silicon with water results in pure silicon which is used in the chemical industry however even greater purity is needed for semiconductor applications and this is produced from the reduction of tetrachlorosilane silicon tetrachloride or trichlorosilane the former is made by chlorinating scrap silicon and the latter is a byproduct of silicone production these compounds are volatile and hence can be purified by repeated fractional distillation followed by reduction to elemental silicon with very pure zinc metal as the reducing agent the spongy pieces of silicon thus produced are melted and then grown to form cylindrical single crystals before being purified by zone refining other routes use the thermal decomposition of silane or tetraiodosilane sii another process used is the reduction of sodium hexafluorosilicate a common waste product of the phosphate fertilizer industry by metallic sodium this is highly exothermic and hence requires no outside energy source silicon nanostructures can be produced directly from silica using conventional metalothermic processes or combustion synthesis methods such nanostructured silicon materials can be used in various functional applications including the anode of lithium ion batteries or phorocatalytic applications hyperfine silicon is made at a higher purity than almost any other material transistor production requires impurity levels in silicon crystals less than part per and in special cases impurity levels below part per are needed and attained silicon nanostructures can directly be produced from silica sand using the combustion synthesis approach such nanostructured silicon materials can be used as the anode of lithium ion batteries libs applications compounds most silicon is used industrially without being purified and indeed often with comparatively little processing from its natural form more than of the earth s crust is composed of silicate minerals which are compounds of silicon and oxygen often with metallic ions when negatively charged silicate anions require cations to balance the charge many of these have direct commercial uses such as clays silica sand and most kinds of building stone thus the vast majority of uses for silicon are as structural compounds either as the silicate minerals or silica crude silicon dioxide silicates are used in making portland cement made mostly of calcium silicates which is used in building mortar and modern stucco but more importantly combined with silica sand and gravel usually containing silicate minerals such as granite to make the concrete that is the basis of most of the very largest industrial building projects of the modern world silica is used to make fire brick a type of ceramic silicate minerals are also in whiteware ceramics an important class of products usually containing various types of fired clay minerals natural aluminium phyllosilicates an example is porcelain which is based on the silicate mineral kaolinite traditional glass silica based soda lime glass also functions in many of the same ways and also is used for windows and containers in addition specialty silica based glass fibers are used for optical fiber as well as to produce fiberglass for structural support and glass wool for thermal insulation silicones often are used in waterproofing treatments molding compounds mold release agents mechanical seals high temperature greases and waxes and caulking compounds silicone is also sometimes used in breast implants contact lenses explosives and pyrotechnics silly putty was originally made by adding boric acid to silicone oil other silicon compounds function as high technology abrasives and new high strength ceramics based upon silicon carbide silicon is a component of some superalloys alloys elemental silicon is added to molten cast iron as ferrosilicon or silicocalcium alloys to improve performance in casting thin sections and to prevent the formation of cementite where exposed to outside air the presence of elemental silicon in molten iron acts as a sink for oxygen so that the steel carbon content which must be kept within narrow limits for each type of steel can be more closely controlled ferrosilicon production and use is a monitor of the steel industry and although this form of elemental silicon is grossly impure it accounts for of the world s use of free silicon silicon is an important constituent of electrical steel modifying its resistivity and ferromagnetic properties the properties of silicon may be used to modify alloys with metals other than iron metallurgical grade silicon is silicon of purity about of the world consumption of metallurgical purity silicon goes for production of aluminium silicon alloys silumin alloys for aluminium part casts mainly for use in the automotive industry silicon s importance in aluminium casting is that a significantly high amount of silicon in aluminium forms a eutectic mixture which solidifies with very little thermal contraction this greatly reduces tearing and cracks formed from stress as casting alloys cool to solidity silicon also significantly improves the hardness and thus wear resistance of aluminium electronics most elemental silicon produced remains as a ferrosilicon alloy and only approximately is refined to metallurgical grade purity a total of million metric tons year an estimated of the world production of metallurgical grade silicon is further refined to semiconductor purity this typically is the nine or purity nearly defect free single crystalline material monocrystalline silicon of such purity is usually produced by the czochralski process and is used to produce silicon wafers used in the semiconductor industry in electronics and in some high cost and high efficiency photovoltaic applications pure silicon is an intrinsic semiconductor which means that unlike metals it conducts electron holes and electrons released from atoms by heat silicon s electrical conductivity increases with higher temperatures pure silicon has too low a conductivity i e too high a resistivity to be used as a circuit element in electronics in practice pure silicon is doped with small concentrations of certain other elements which greatly increase its conductivity and adjust its electrical response by controlling the number and charge positive or negative of activated carriers such control is necessary for transistors solar cells semiconductor detectors and other semiconductor devices used in the computer industry and other technical applications in silicon photonics silicon may be used as a continuous wave raman laser medium to produce coherent light in common integrated circuits a wafer of monocrystalline silicon serves as a mechanical support for the circuits which are created by doping and insulated from each other by thin layers of silicon oxide an insulator that is easily produced on si surfaces by processes of thermal oxidation or local oxidation locos which involve exposing the element to oxygen under the proper conditions that can be predicted by the deal grove model silicon has become the most popular material for both high power semiconductors and integrated circuits because it can withstand the highest temperatures and greatest electrical activity without suffering avalanche breakdown an electron avalanche is created when heat produces free electrons and holes which in turn pass more current which produces more heat in addition the insulating oxide of silicon is not soluble in water which gives it an advantage over germanium an element with similar properties which can also be used in semiconductor devices in certain fabrication techniques monocrystalline silicon is expensive to produce and is usually justified only in production of integrated circuits where tiny crystal imperfections can interfere with tiny circuit paths for other uses other types of pure silicon may be employed these include hydrogenated amorphous silicon and upgraded metallurgical grade silicon umg si used in the production of low cost large area electronics in applications such as liquid crystal displays and of large area low cost thin film solar cells such semiconductor grades of silicon are either slightly less pure or polycrystalline rather than monocrystalline and are produced in comparable quantities as the monocrystalline silicon to metric tons per year the market for the lesser grade is growing more quickly than for monocrystalline silicon by polycrystalline silicon production used mostly in solar cells was projected to reach metric tons per year while monocrystalline semiconductor grade silicon was expected to remain less than tons per year quantum dots silicon quantum dots are created through the thermal processing of hydrogen silsesquioxane into nanocrystals ranging from a few nanometers to a few microns displaying size dependent luminescent properties the nanocrystals display large stokes shifts converting photons in the ultra violet range to photons in the visible or infrared depending on the particle size allowing for applications in quantum dot displays and luminescent solar concentrators due to their limited self absorption a benefit of using silicon based quantum dots over cadmium or indium is the non toxic metal free nature of silicon another application of silicon quantum dots is for sensing of hazardous materials the sensors take advantage of the luminescent properties of the quantum dots through quenching of the photoluminescence in the presence of the hazardous substance there are many methods used for hazardous chemical sensing with a few being electron transfer fluorescence resonance energy transfer and photocurrent generation electron transfer quenching occurs when the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo is slightly lower in energy than the conduction band of the quantum dot allowing for the transfer electrons between the two preventing recombination of the holes and electrons within the nanocrystals the effect can also be achieved in reverse with a donor molecule having its highest occupied molecular orbital homo slightly higher than a valence band edge of the quantum dot allowing electrons to transfer between them filling the holes and preventing recombination fluorescence resonance energy transfer occurs when a complex forms between the quantum dot and a quencher molecule the complex will continue to absorb light but when the energy is converted to the ground state it does not release a photon quenching the material the third method uses different approach by measuring the photocurrent emitted by the quantum dots instead of monitoring the photoluminescent display if the concentration of the desired chemical increases then the photocurrent given off by the nanocrystals will change in response biological role although silicon is readily available in the form of silicates very few organisms use it directly diatoms radiolaria and siliceous sponges use biogenic silica as a structural material for their skeletons some plants accumulate silica in their tissues and require silicon for their growth for example rice silicon may be taken up by plants as orthosilicic acid also known as monosilicic acid and transported through the xylem where it forms amorphous complexes with components of the cell wall this has been shown to improve cell wall strength and structural integrity in some plants thereby reducing insect herbivory and pathogenic infections in certain plants silicon may also upregulate the production of volatile organic compounds and phytohormones which play a significant role in plant defense mechanisms in more advanced plants the silica phytoliths opal phytoliths are rigid microscopic bodies occurring in the cell several horticultural crops are known to protect themselves against fungal plant pathogens with silica to such a degree that fungicide application may fail unless accompanied by sufficient silicon nutrition silicaceous plant defense molecules activate some phytoalexins meaning some of them are signalling substances producing acquired immunity when deprived some plants will substitute with increased production of other defensive substances life on earth is largely composed of carbon but astrobiology considers that extraterrestrial life may have other hypothetical types of biochemistry silicon is considered an alternative to carbon as it can create complex and stable molecules with four covalent bonds required for a dna analog and it is available in large quantities marine microbial influences diatoms uses silicon in the biogenic silica bsio form which is taken up by the silicon transport protein sit to be predominantly used in the cell wall structure as frustules silicon enters the ocean in a dissolved form such as silicic acid or silicate since diatoms are one of the main users of these forms of silicon they contribute greatly to the concentration of silicon throughout the ocean silicon forms a nutrient like profile in the ocean due to the diatom productivity in shallow depths therefore less concentration of silicon in the upper ocean and more concentrations of silicon in the deep lower ocean diatom productivity in the upper ocean contribute to the amount of silicon exported to the lower ocean when diatom cells are lysed in the upper ocean their nutrients like iron zinc and silicon are brought to the lower ocean through a process called marine snow marine snow involves the downward transfer of particulate organic matter by vertical mixing of dissolved organic matter it has been suggested that silicon is considered crucial to diatom productivity and as long as there is silicic acid available for diatoms to use the diatoms can contribute to other important nutrient concentrations in the deep ocean as well in coastal zones diatoms serve as the major phytoplanktonic organisms and greatly contribute to biogenic silica production in the open ocean however diatoms have a reduced role in global annual silica production diatoms in north atlantic and north pacific subtropical gyres only contribute about of global annual marine silica production the southern ocean produces about one third of global marine biogenic silica the southern ocean is referred to as having a biogeochemical divide since only minuscule amounts of silicon are transported out of this region human nutrition there is some evidence that silicon is important to human health for their nail hair bone and skin tissues for example in studies that demonstrate that premenopausal women with higher dietary silicon intake have higher bone density and that silicon supplementation can increase bone volume and density in patients with osteoporosis silicon is needed for synthesis of elastin and collagen of which the aorta contains the greatest quantity in the human body and has been considered an essential element nevertheless it is difficult to prove its essentiality because silicon is very common and hence deficiency symptoms are difficult to reproduce silicon is currently under consideration for elevation to the status of a plant beneficial substance by the association of american plant food control officials aapfco safety people may be exposed to elemental silicon in the workplace by breathing it in swallowing it or having contact with the skin or eye in the latter two cases silicon poses a slight hazard as an irritant it is hazardous if inhaled the occupational safety and health administration osha has set the legal limit for silicon exposure in the workplace as mg m total exposure and mg m respiratory exposure over an eight hour workday the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit rel of mg m total exposure and mg m respiratory exposure over an eight hour workday inhalation of crystalline silica dust may lead to silicosis an occupational lung disease marked by inflammation and scarring in the form of nodular lesions in the upper lobes of the lungs ,14
Phosphorus,P,phosphorus is a chemical element with the symbol p and atomic number elemental phosphorus exists in two major forms white phosphorus and red phosphorus but because it is highly reactive phosphorus is never found as a free element on earth it has a concentration in the earth s crust of about one gram per kilogram compare copper at about grams in minerals phosphorus generally occurs as phosphate elemental phosphorus was first isolated as white phosphorus in white phosphorus emits a faint glow when exposed to oxygen hence the name taken from greek mythology meaning light bearer latin lucifer referring to the morning star the planet venus the term phosphorescence meaning glow after illumination derives from this property of phosphorus although the word has since been used for a different physical process that produces a glow the glow of phosphorus is caused by oxidation of the white but not red phosphorus a process now called chemiluminescence together with nitrogen arsenic antimony and bismuth phosphorus is classified as a pnictogen phosphorus is an element essential to sustaining life largely through phosphates compounds containing the phosphate ion po phosphates are a component of dna rna atp and phospholipids complex compounds fundamental to cells elemental phosphorus was first isolated from human urine and bone ash was an important early phosphate source phosphate mines contain fossils because phosphate is present in the fossilized deposits of animal remains and excreta low phosphate levels are an important limit to growth in some aquatic systems the vast majority of phosphorus compounds mined are consumed as fertilisers phosphate is needed to replace the phosphorus that plants remove from the soil and its annual demand is rising nearly twice as fast as the growth of the human population other applications include organophosphorus compounds in detergents pesticides and nerve agents characteristics allotropes phosphorus has several allotropes that exhibit strikingly diverse properties the two most common allotropes are white phosphorus and red phosphorus from the perspective of applications and chemical literature the most important form of elemental phosphorus is white phosphorus often abbreviated as wp it is a soft waxy solid which consists of tetrahedral p molecules in which each atom is bound to the other three atoms by a formal single bond this p tetrahedron is also present in liquid and gaseous phosphorus up to the temperature of c f when it starts decomposing to p molecules the p molecule in the gas phase has a p p bond length of rg as was determined by gas electron diffraction the nature of bonding in this p tetrahedron can be described by spherical aromaticity or cluster bonding that is the electrons are highly delocalized this has been illustrated by calculations of the magnetically induced currents which sum up to na t much more than in the archetypical aromatic molecule benzene na t white phosphorus exists in two crystalline forms alpha and beta at room temperature the form is stable it is more common has cubic crystal structure and at k c it transforms into form which has hexagonal crystal structure these forms differ in terms of the relative orientations of the constituent p tetrahedra the form of white phosphorus contains three slightly different p molecules i e different p p bond lengths between and the average p p bond length is white phosphorus is the least stable the most reactive the most volatile the least dense and the most toxic of the allotropes white phosphorus gradually changes to red phosphorus this transformation is accelerated by light and heat and samples of white phosphorus almost always contain some red phosphorus and accordingly appear yellow for this reason white phosphorus that is aged or otherwise impure e g weapons grade not lab grade wp is also called yellow phosphorus when exposed to oxygen white phosphorus glows in the dark with a very faint tinge of green and blue it is highly flammable and pyrophoric self igniting upon contact with air owing to its pyrophoricity white phosphorus is used as an additive in napalm the odour of combustion of this form has a characteristic garlic smell and samples are commonly coated with white phosphorus pentoxide which consists of p o tetrahedra with oxygen inserted between the phosphorus atoms and at their vertices white phosphorus is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulfide thermal decomposition of p at k gives diphosphorus p this species is not stable as a solid or liquid the dimeric unit contains a triple bond and is analogous to n it can also be generated as a transient intermediate in solution by thermolysis of organophosphorus precursor reagents at still higher temperatures p dissociates into atomic p red phosphorus is polymeric in structure it can be viewed as a derivative of p wherein one p p bond is broken and one additional bond is formed with the neighbouring tetrahedron resulting in chains of p molecules linked by van der waals forces red phosphorus may be formed by heating white phosphorus to c f or by exposing white phosphorus to sunlight phosphorus after this treatment is amorphous upon further heating this material crystallises in this sense red phosphorus is not an allotrope but rather an intermediate phase between the white and violet phosphorus and most of its properties have a range of values for example freshly prepared bright red phosphorus is highly reactive and ignites at about c f though it is more stable than white phosphorus which ignites at about c f after prolonged heating or storage the color darkens see infobox images the resulting product is more stable and does not spontaneously ignite in air violet phosphorus is a form of phosphorus that can be produced by day long annealing of red phosphorus above c in hittorf discovered that when phosphorus was recrystallised from molten lead a red purple form is obtained therefore this form is sometimes known as hittorf s phosphorus or violet or metallic phosphorus black phosphorus is the least reactive allotrope and the thermodynamically stable form below c f it is also known as metallic phosphorus and has a structure somewhat resembling that of graphite it is obtained by heating white phosphorus under high pressures about standard atmospheres or gigapascals it can also be produced at ambient conditions using metal salts e g mercury as catalysts in appearance properties and structure it resembles graphite being black and flaky a conductor of electricity and has puckered sheets of linked atoms another form scarlet phosphorus is obtained by allowing a solution of white phosphorus in carbon disulfide to evaporate in sunlight chemiluminescence when first isolated it was observed that the green glow emanating from white phosphorus would persist for a time in a stoppered jar but then cease robert boyle in the s ascribed it to debilitation of the air actually it is oxygen being consumed by the th century it was known that in pure oxygen phosphorus does not glow at all there is only a range of partial pressures at which it does heat can be applied to drive the reaction at higher pressures in the glow was explained by r j van zee and a u khan a reaction with oxygen takes place at the surface of the solid or liquid phosphorus forming the short lived molecules hpo and p o that both emit visible light the reaction is slow and only very little of the intermediates are required to produce the luminescence hence the extended time the glow continues in a stoppered jar since its discovery phosphors and phosphorescence were used loosely to describe substances that shine in the dark without burning although the term phosphorescence is derived from phosphorus the reaction that gives phosphorus its glow is properly called chemiluminescence glowing due to a cold chemical reaction not phosphorescence re emitting light that previously fell onto a substance and excited it isotopes there are known isotopes of phosphorus ranging from p to p only p is stable and is therefore present at abundance the half integer nuclear spin and high abundance of p make phosphorus nmr spectroscopy a very useful analytical tool in studies of phosphorus containing samples two radioactive isotopes of phosphorus have half lives suitable for biological scientific experiments these are p a beta emitter mev with a half life of days which is used routinely in life science laboratories primarily to produce radiolabeled dna and rna probes e g for use in northern blots or southern blots p a beta emitter mev with a half life of days it is used in life science laboratories in applications in which lower energy beta emissions are advantageous such as dna sequencing the high energy beta particles from p penetrate skin and corneas and any p ingested inhaled or absorbed is readily incorporated into bone and nucleic acids for these reasons occupational safety and health administration in the united states and similar institutions in other developed countries require personnel working with p to wear lab coats disposable gloves and safety glasses or goggles to protect the eyes and avoid working directly over open containers monitoring personal clothing and surface contamination is also required shielding requires special consideration the high energy of the beta particles gives rise to secondary emission of x rays via bremsstrahlung braking radiation in dense shielding materials such as lead therefore the radiation must be shielded with low density materials such as acrylic or other plastic water or when transparency is not required even wood occurrence universe in astronomers detected phosphorus in cassiopeia a which confirmed that this element is produced in supernovae as a byproduct of supernova nucleosynthesis the phosphorus to iron ratio in material from the supernova remnant could be up to times higher than in the milky way in general in astronomers analysed alma and rosina data from the massive star forming region afgl to detect phosphorus bearing molecules and how they are carried in comets to the early earth crust and organic sources phosphorus has a concentration in the earth s crust of about one gram per kilogram compare copper at about grams it is not found free in nature but is widely distributed in many minerals usually as phosphates inorganic phosphate rock which is partially made of apatite a group of minerals being generally pentacalcium triorthophosphate fluoride hydroxide is today the chief commercial source of this element according to the us geological survey usgs about percent of the global phosphorus reserves are in the arab nations of earth s known reserves are in morocco with smaller deposits in china russia florida idaho tennessee utah and elsewhere albright and wilson in the uk and their niagara falls plant for instance were using phosphate rock in the s and s from tennessee florida and the les du conn table guano island sources of phosphate by they were using phosphate rock mainly from tennessee and north africa organic sources namely urine bone ash and in the latter th century guano were historically of importance but had only limited commercial success as urine contains phosphorus it has fertilising qualities which are still harnessed today in some countries including sweden using methods for reuse of excreta to this end urine can be used as a fertiliser in its pure form or part of being mixed with water in the form of sewage or sewage sludge compounds phosphorus v the most prevalent compounds of phosphorus are derivatives of phosphate po a tetrahedral anion phosphate is the conjugate base of phosphoric acid which is produced on a massive scale for use in fertilisers being triprotic phosphoric acid converts stepwise to three conjugate bases h po h o h o h po ka h po h o h o hpo ka hpo h o h o po ka phosphate exhibits a tendency to form chains and rings containing p o p bonds many polyphosphates are known including atp polyphosphates arise by dehydration of hydrogen phosphates such as hpo and h po for example the industrially important pentasodium triphosphate also known as sodium tripolyphosphate stpp is produced industrially on by the megatonne by this condensation reaction na ho po na ho po na o p o p o o po h ophosphorus pentoxide p o is the acid anhydride of phosphoric acid but several intermediates between the two are known this waxy white solid reacts vigorously with water with metal cations phosphate forms a variety of salts these solids are polymeric featuring p o m linkages when the metal cation has a charge of or the salts are generally insoluble hence they exist as common minerals many phosphate salts are derived from hydrogen phosphate hpo pcl and pf are common compounds pf is a colourless gas and the molecules have trigonal bipyramidal geometry pcl is a colourless

pentachloride and pentafluoride are lewis acids with fluoride pf forms pf an anion that is isoelectronic with sf the most important oxyhalide is phosphorus oxychloride pocl which is approximately tetrahedral before extensive computer calculations were feasible it was thought that bonding in phosphorus v compounds involved d orbitals computer modeling of molecular orbital theory indicates that

is like that of p o without the terminal oxide groups phosphorus i and phosphorus ii these compounds generally feature p p bonds examples include catenated derivatives of phosphine and organophosphines compounds containing p p double bonds have also been observed although they are rare phosphides and phosphines phosphides arise by reaction of metals with red phosphorus the alkali metals group and alkaline earth metals can form ionic compounds containing the phosphide ion p these compounds react with water to form phosphine other phosphides for example na p are known for these reactive metals with the transition metals as well as the monophosphides there are metal rich phosphides which are generally hard refractory compounds with a metallic lustre and phosphorus rich phosphides which are less stable and include semiconductors schreibersite is a naturally occurring metal rich phosphide found in meteorites the structures of the metal rich and phosphorus rich phosphides can be complex phosphine ph and its organic derivatives pr are structural analogues of ammonia nh but the bond angles at phosphorus are closer to for phosphine and its organic derivatives it is an ill smelling toxic compound phosphorus has an oxidation number of in phosphine phosphine is produced by hydrolysis of calcium phosphide ca p unlike ammonia phosphine is oxidised by air phosphine is also far less basic than ammonia other phosphines are known which contain chains of up to nine phosphorus atoms and have the formula pnhn the highly flammable gas diphosphine p h is an analogue of hydrazine oxoacids phosphorous oxoacids are extensive often commercially important and sometimes structurally complicated they all have acidic protons bound to oxygen atoms some have nonacidic protons that are bonded directly to phosphorus and some contain phosphorus phosphorus bonds although many oxoacids of phosphorus are formed only nine are commercially important and three of them hypophosphorous acid phosphorous acid and phosphoric acid are particularly important nitrides the pn molecule is considered unstable but is a product of crystalline phosphorus nitride decomposition at k similarly h pn is considered unstable and phosphorus nitride halogens like f pn cl pn br pn and i pn oligomerise into cyclic polyphosphazenes for example compounds of the formula

was the name for the planet venus and is derived from the greek words light carry which roughly translates as light bringer or light carrier in greek mythology and tradition augerinus morning star still in use today hesperus or hesperinus or or evening star still in use today and eosphorus dawnbearer not in use for the planet after christianity are close homologues and also associated with phosphorus the morning star according to the oxford english dictionary the correct spelling of the element is phosphorus the word phosphorous is the adjectival form of the p valence so just as sulfur forms sulfurous and sulfuric compounds phosphorus forms phosphorous compounds e g phosphorous acid and p valence phosphoric compounds e g phosphoric acids and phosphates discovery the discovery of phosphorus the first element to be discovered that was not known since ancient times is credited to the german alchemist hennig brand in although others might have discovered phosphorus around the same time brand experimented with urine which contains considerable quantities of dissolved phosphates from normal metabolism working in hamburg brand attempted to create the fabled philosopher s stone through the distillation of some salts by evaporating urine and in the process produced a white material that glowed in the dark and burned brilliantly it was named phosphorus mirabilis miraculous bearer of light brand s process originally involved letting urine stand for days until it gave off a terrible smell then he boiled it down to a paste heated this paste to a high temperature and led the vapours through water where he hoped they would condense to gold instead he obtained a white waxy substance that glowed in the dark brand had discovered phosphorus specifically brand produced ammonium sodium hydrogen phosphate nh nahpo while the quantities were essentially correct it took about litres us gal of urine to make about g of phosphorus it was unnecessary to allow the urine to rot first later scientists discovered that fresh urine yielded the same amount of phosphorus brand at first tried to keep the method secret but later sold the recipe for thalers to d krafft from dresden krafft toured much of europe with it including england where he met with robert boyle the secret that the substance was made from urine leaked out and johann kunckel was able to reproduce it in sweden later boyle in london also managed to make phosphorus possibly with the aid of his assistant ambrose godfrey hanckwitz godfrey later made a business of the manufacture of phosphorus boyle states that krafft gave him no information as to the preparation of phosphorus other than that it was derived from somewhat that belonged to the body of man this gave boyle a valuable clue so that he too managed to make phosphorus and published the method of its manufacture later he improved brand s process by using sand in the reaction still using urine as base material napo sio c na sio co p robert boyle was the first to use phosphorus to ignite sulfur tipped wooden splints forerunners of our modern matches in phosphorus was the th element to be discovered because of its tendency to spontaneously combust when left alone in air it is sometimes referred to as the devil s element bone ash and guano antoine lavoisier recognized phosphorus as an element in after johan gottlieb gahn and carl wilhelm scheele in showed that calcium phosphate ca po is found in bones by obtaining elemental phosphorus from bone ash bone ash was the major source of phosphorus until the s the method started by roasting bones then employed the use of fire clay retorts encased in a very hot brick furnace to distill out the highly toxic elemental phosphorus product alternately precipitated phosphates could be made from ground up bones that had been de greased and treated with strong acids white phosphorus could then be made by heating the precipitated phosphates mixed with ground coal or charcoal in an iron pot and distilling off phosphorus vapour in a retort carbon monoxide and other flammable gases produced during the reduction process were burnt off in a flare stack in the s world phosphate production turned to the mining of tropical island deposits formed from bird and bat guano see also guano islands act these became an important source of phosphates for fertiliser in the latter half of the th century phosphate rock phosphate rock which usually contains calcium phosphate was first used in to make phosphorus and following the introduction of the electric arc furnace by james burgess readman in patented elemental phosphorus production switched from the bone ash heating to electric arc production from phosphate rock after the depletion of world guano sources about the same time mineral phosphates became the major source of phosphate fertiliser production phosphate rock production greatly increased after world war ii and remains the primary global source of phosphorus and phosphorus chemicals today see the article on peak phosphorus for more information on the history and present state of phosphate mining phosphate rock remains a feedstock in the fertiliser industry where it is treated with sulfuric acid to produce various superphosphate fertiliser products incendiaries white phosphorus was first made commercially in the th century for the match industry this used bone ash for a phosphate source as described above the bone ash process became obsolete when the submerged arc furnace for phosphorus production was introduced to reduce phosphate rock the electric furnace method allowed production to increase to the point where phosphorus could be used in weapons of war in world war i it was used in incendiaries smoke screens and tracer bullets a special incendiary bullet was developed to shoot at hydrogen filled zeppelins over britain hydrogen being highly flammable during world war ii molotov cocktails made of phosphorus dissolved in petrol were distributed in britain to specially selected civilians within the british resistance operation for defence and phosphorus incendiary bombs were used in war on a large scale burning phosphorus is difficult to extinguish and if it splashes onto human skin it has horrific effects early matches used white phosphorus in their composition which was dangerous due to its toxicity murders suicides and accidental poisonings resulted from its use an apocryphal tale tells of a woman attempting to murder her husband with white phosphorus in his food which was detected by the stew s giving off luminous steam in addition exposure to the vapours gave match workers a severe necrosis of the bones of the jaw known as phossy jaw when a safe process for manufacturing red phosphorus was discovered with its far lower flammability and toxicity laws were enacted under the berne convention requiring its adoption as a safer alternative for match manufacture the toxicity of white phosphorus led to discontinuation of its use in matches the allies used phosphorus incendiary bombs in world war ii to destroy hamburg the place where the miraculous bearer of light was first discovered production in the usgs estimated billion tons of world reserves where reserve figures refer to the amount assumed recoverable at current market prices billion tons were mined in critical to contemporary agriculture its annual demand is rising nearly twice as fast as the growth of the human population the production of phosphorus may have peaked before and some scientists predict reserves will be depleted in before the end of the st century phosphorus comprises about by mass of the average rock and consequently the earth s supply is vast though dilute wet process most phosphorus bearing material is for agriculture fertilisers in this case where the standards of purity are modest phosphorus is obtained from phosphate rock by what is called the wet process the minerals are treated with sulfuric acid to give phosphoric acid phosphoric acid is then neutralized to give various phosphate salts which comprise fertilizers in the wet process phosphorus does not undergo redox about five tons of phosphogypsum waste are generated per ton of phosphoric acid production annually the estimated generation of phosphogypsum worldwide is to mt thermal process for the use of phosphorus in drugs detergents and foodstuff the standards of purity are high which led to the development of the thermal process in this process phosphate minerals are converted to white phosphorus which can be purified by distillation the white phosphorus is then oxidised to phosphoric acid and subsequently neutralised with a base to give phosphate salts the thermal process is energy intensive presently about short tons t of elemental phosphorus is produced annually calcium phosphate phosphate rock mostly mined in florida and north africa can be heated to c with sand which is mostly sio and coke to produce p the p product being volatile is readily isolated ca po f sio c p co casio caf ca po sio c casio co p side products from the thermal process include ferrophosphorus a crude form of fe p resulting from iron impurities in the mineral precursors the silicate slag is a useful construction material the fluoride is sometimes recovered for use in water fluoridation more problematic is a mud containing significant amounts of white phosphorus production of white phosphorus is conducted in large facilities in part because it is energy intensive the white phosphorus is transported in molten form some major accidents have occurred during transportation historical routes historically before the development of mineral based extractions white phosphorus was isolated on an industrial scale from bone ash in this process the tricalcium phosphate in bone ash is converted to monocalcium phosphate with sulfuric acid ca po h so ca h po caso monocalcium phosphate is then dehydrated to the corresponding metaphosphate ca h po ca po h owhen ignited to a white heat c with charcoal calcium metaphosphate yields two thirds of its weight of white phosphorus while one third of the phosphorus remains in the residue as calcium orthophosphate ca po c ca po co p applications food additive phosphorus is an essential mineral for humans listed in the dietary reference intake dri food grade phosphoric acid additive e is used to acidify foods and beverages such as various colas and jams providing a tangy or sour taste the phosphoric acid also serves as a preservative soft drinks containing phosphoric acid which would include coca cola are sometimes called phosphate sodas or phosphates phosphoric acid in soft drinks has the potential to cause dental erosion phosphoric acid also has the potential to contribute to the formation of kidney stones especially in those who have had kidney stones previously fertiliser phosphorus is an essential plant nutrient the most often limiting nutrient after nitrogen and the bulk of all phosphorus production is in concentrated phosphoric acids for agriculture fertilisers containing as much as to p o that led to large increase in phosphate po production in the second half of the th century artificial phosphate fertilisation is necessary because phosphorus is essential to all living organisms it is involved in energy transfers strength of root and stems photosynthesis the expansion of plant roots formation of seeds and flowers and other important factors effecting overall plant health and genetics natural phosphorus bearing compounds are mostly inaccessible to plants because of the low solubility and mobility in soil most phosphorus is very stable in the soil minerals or organic matter of the soil even when phosphorus is added in manure or fertilizer it can become fixed in the soil therefore the natural cycle of phosphorus is very slow some of the fixed phosphorus is released again over time sustaining wild plant growth however more is needed to sustain intensive cultivation of crops fertiliser is often in the form of superphosphate of lime a mixture of calcium dihydrogen phosphate ca h po and calcium sulfate dihydrate caso h o produced reacting sulfuric acid and water with calcium phosphate processing phosphate minerals with sulfuric acid for obtaining fertiliser is so important to the global economy that this is the primary industrial market for sulfuric acid and the greatest industrial use of elemental sulfur organophosphorus white phosphorus is widely used to make organophosphorus compounds through intermediate phosphorus chlorides and two phosphorus sulfides phosphorus pentasulfide and phosphorus sesquisulfide organophosphorus compounds have many applications including in plasticisers flame retardants pesticides extraction agents nerve agents and water treatment metallurgical aspects phosphorus is also an important component in steel production in the making of phosphor bronze and in many other related products phosphorus is added to metallic copper during its smelting process to react with oxygen present as an impurity in copper and to produce phosphorus containing copper cuofp alloys with a higher hydrogen embrittlement resistance than normal copper matches the first striking match with a phosphorus head was invented by charles sauria in these matches and subsequent modifications were made with heads of white phosphorus an oxygen releasing compound potassium chlorate lead dioxide or sometimes nitrate and a binder they were poisonous to the workers in manufacture sensitive to storage conditions toxic if ingested and hazardous when accidentally ignited on a rough surface production in several countries was banned between and the international berne convention ratified in prohibited the use of white phosphorus in matches in consequence phosphorous matches were gradually replaced by safer alternatives around french chemists henri s v ne and emile david cahen invented the modern strike anywhere match wherein the white phosphorus was replaced by phosphorus sesquisulfide p s a non toxic and non pyrophoric compound that ignites under friction for a time these safer strike anywhere matches were quite popular but in the long run they were superseded by the modern safety match safety matches are very difficult to ignite on any surface other than a special striker strip the strip contains non toxic red phosphorus and the match head potassium chlorate an oxygen releasing compound when struck small amounts of abrasion from match head and striker strip are mixed intimately to make a small quantity of armstrong s mixture a very touch sensitive composition the fine powder ignites immediately and provides the initial spark to set off the match head safety matches separate the two components of the ignition mixture until the match is struck this is the key safety advantage as it prevents accidental ignition nonetheless safety matches invented in by gustaf erik pasch and market ready by the s didn t gain consumer acceptance until the prohibition of white phosphorus using a dedicated striker strip was considered clumsy water softening sodium tripolyphosphate made from phosphoric acid is used in laundry detergents in some countries but banned for this use in others this compound softens the water to enhance the performance of the detergents and to prevent pipe boiler tube corrosion miscellaneous phosphates are used to make special glasses for sodium lamps bone ash calcium phosphate is used in the production of fine china phosphoric acid made from elemental phosphorus is used in food applications such as soft drinks and as a starting point for food grade phosphates these include mono calcium phosphate for baking powder and sodium tripolyphosphate phosphates are used to improve the characteristics of processed meat and cheese and in toothpaste white phosphorus called wp slang term willie peter is used in military applications as incendiary bombs for smoke screening as smoke pots and smoke bombs and in tracer ammunition it is also a part of an obsolete m white phosphorus us hand grenade this multipurpose grenade was mostly used for signaling smoke screens and inflammation it could also cause severe burns and had a psychological impact on the enemy military uses of white phosphorus are constrained by international law p and p are used as radioactive tracers in biochemical laboratories biological role inorganic phosphorus in the form of the phosphate po is required for all known forms of life phosphorus plays a major role in the structural framework of dna and rna living cells use phosphate to transport cellular energy with adenosine triphosphate atp necessary for every cellular process that uses energy atp is also important for phosphorylation a key regulatory event in cells phospholipids are the main structural components of all cellular membranes calcium phosphate salts assist in stiffening bones biochemists commonly use the abbreviation pi to refer to inorganic phosphate every living cell is encased in a membrane that separates it from its surroundings cellular membranes are composed of a phospholipid matrix and proteins typically in the form of a bilayer phospholipids are derived from glycerol with two of the glycerol hydroxyl oh protons replaced by fatty acids as an ester and the third hydroxyl proton has been replaced with phosphate bonded to another alcohol an average adult human contains about kg of phosphorus about in bones and teeth in the form of apatite and the remainder in soft tissues and extracellular fluids the phosphorus content increases from about by mass in infancy to by mass in adults average phosphorus concentration in the blood is about g l about of that is organic and inorganic phosphates an adult with healthy diet consumes and excretes about grams of phosphorus per day with consumption in the form of inorganic phosphate and phosphorus containing biomolecules such as nucleic acids and phospholipids and excretion almost exclusively in the form of phosphate ions such as h po and hpo only about of body phosphate circulates in the blood paralleling the amount of phosphate available to soft tissue cells bone and teeth enamel the main component of bone is hydroxyapatite as well as amorphous forms of calcium phosphate possibly including carbonate hydroxyapatite is the main component of tooth enamel water fluoridation enhances the resistance of teeth to decay by the partial conversion of this mineral to the still harder material called fluoroapatite ca po oh f ca po f oh phosphorus deficiency in medicine phosphate deficiency syndrome may be caused by malnutrition by failure to absorb phosphate and by metabolic syndromes that draw phosphate from the blood such as in refeeding syndrome after malnutrition or passing too much of it into the urine all are characterised by hypophosphatemia which is a condition of low levels of soluble phosphate levels in the blood serum and inside the cells symptoms of hypophosphatemia include neurological dysfunction and disruption of muscle and blood cells due to lack of atp too much phosphate can lead to diarrhoea and calcification hardening of organs and soft tissue and can interfere with the body s ability to use iron calcium magnesium and zinc phosphorus is an essential macromineral for plants which is studied extensively in edaphology to understand plant uptake from soil systems phosphorus is a limiting factor in many ecosystems that is the scarcity of phosphorus limits the rate of organism growth an excess of phosphorus can also be problematic especially in aquatic systems where eutrophication sometimes leads to algal blooms nutrition dietary

daily intake food sources the main food sources for phosphorus are the same as those containing protein although proteins do not contain phosphorus for example milk meat and soya typically also have phosphorus as a rule if a diet has sufficient protein and calcium the amount of phosphorus is probably sufficient precautions organic compounds of phosphorus form a wide class of materials many are required for life but some are extremely toxic fluorophosphate esters are among the most potent neurotoxins known a wide range of organophosphorus compounds are used for their toxicity as pesticides herbicides insecticides fungicides etc and weaponised as nerve agents against enemy humans most inorganic phosphates are relatively nontoxic and essential nutrients the white phosphorus allotrope presents a significant hazard because it ignites in air and produces phosphoric acid residue chronic white phosphorus poisoning leads to necrosis of the jaw called phossy jaw white phosphorus is toxic causing severe liver damage on ingestion and may cause a condition known as smoking stool syndrome in the past external exposure to elemental phosphorus was treated by washing the affected area with copper sulfate solution to form harmless compounds that are then washed away according to the recent us navy s treatment of chemical agent casualties and conventional military chemical injuries fm part conventional military chemical injuries cupric copper ii sulfate has been used by u s personnel in the past and is still being used by some nations however copper sulfate is toxic and its use will be discontinued copper sulfate may produce kidney and cerebral toxicity as well as intravascular hemolysis the manual suggests instead a bicarbonate solution to neutralise phosphoric acid which

systemic poisoning do not apply oily based ointments until it is certain that all wp has been removed following complete removal of the particles treat the lesions as thermal burns as white phosphorus readily mixes with oils any oily substances or ointments are not recommended until the area is thoroughly cleaned and all white phosphorus removed people can be exposed to phosphorus in the workplace by inhalation ingestion skin contact and eye contact the occupational safety and health administration osha has set the phosphorus exposure limit permissible exposure limit in the workplace at mg m

d octasulfur is a soft bright yellow solid that is odorless but impure samples have an odor similar to that of matches it melts at c f boils at c f and sublimes more or less between c f and c f at c f below its melting temperature cyclo octasulfur changes from octasulfur to the polymorph the structure of the s ring is virtually unchanged by this phase change which affects the intermolecular interactions between its melting and boiling temperatures octasulfur changes its allotrope again turning from octasulfur to sulfur again accompanied by a lower density but increased viscosity due to the formation of polymers at higher temperatures the viscosity decreases as depolymerization occurs molten sulfur assumes a dark red color above c f the density of sulfur is about g cm depending on the allotrope all of the stable allotropes are excellent electrical insulators sulfur is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulfide and to a lesser extent in other nonpolar organic solvents such as benzene and toluene chemical properties under normal conditions sulfur hydrolyzes very slowly to mainly form hydrogen sulfide and sulfuric acid s h o h s h so the reaction involves adsorption of protons onto s clusters followed by disproportionation into the reaction products the second fourth and sixth ionization energies of sulfur are kj mol kj mol and kj mol respectively a composition of products of sulfur s reactions with oxidants and its oxidation state depends on that whether releasing out of a reaction energy overcomes these thresholds applying catalysts and or supply of outer energy may vary sulfur s oxidation state and a composition of reaction products while reaction between sulfur and oxygen at normal conditions gives sulfur dioxide oxidation state formation of sulfur trioxide oxidation state requires temperature c and presence of a catalyst in reactions with elements electronegativity of which less than sulfur s it comes as an oxidant and forms sulfides with oxidation state sulfur reacts with nearly all other elements with the exception of the noble gases even with the notoriously unreactive metal iridium yielding iridium disulfide some of those reactions need elevated temperatures isotopes sulfur has known isotopes four of which are stable s s s and s other than s with a half life of days and formed in cosmic ray spallation of ar the radioactive isotopes of sulfur have half lives less than hours when sulfide minerals are precipitated isotopic equilibration among solids and liquid may cause small differences in the s values of co genetic minerals the differences between minerals can be used to estimate the temperature of equilibration the c and s of coexisting carbonate minerals and sulfides can be used to determine the ph and oxygen fugacity of the ore bearing fluid during ore formation in most forest ecosystems sulfate is derived mostly from the atmosphere weathering of ore minerals and evaporites contribute some sulfur sulfur with a distinctive isotopic composition has been used to identify pollution sources and enriched sulfur has been added as a tracer in hydrologic studies differences in the natural abundances can be used in systems where there is sufficient variation in the s of ecosystem components rocky mountain lakes thought to be dominated by atmospheric sources of sulfate have been found to have characteristic s values from lakes believed to be dominated by watershed sources of sulfate natural occurrence s is created inside massive stars at a depth where the temperature exceeds k by the fusion of one nucleus of silicon plus one nucleus of helium as this nuclear reaction is part of the alpha process that produces elements in abundance sulfur is the th most common element in the universe sulfur usually as sulfide is present in many types of meteorites ordinary chondrites contain on average sulfur and carbonaceous chondrites may contain as much as it is normally present as troilite fes but there are exceptions with carbonaceous chondrites containing free sulfur sulfates and other sulfur compounds the distinctive colors of jupiter s volcanic moon io are attributed to various forms of molten solid and gaseous sulfur it is the fifth most common element by mass in the earth elemental sulfur can be found near hot springs and volcanic regions in many parts of the world especially along the pacific ring of fire such volcanic deposits are currently mined in indonesia chile and japan these deposits are polycrystalline with the largest documented single crystal measuring cm historically sicily was a major source of sulfur in the industrial revolution lakes of molten sulfur up to m in diameter have been found on the sea floor associated with submarine volcanoes at depths where the boiling point of water is higher than the melting point of sulfur native sulfur is synthesised by anaerobic bacteria acting on sulfate minerals such as gypsum in salt domes significant deposits in salt domes occur along the coast of the gulf of mexico and in evaporites in eastern europe and western asia native sulfur may be produced by geological processes alone fossil based sulfur deposits from salt domes were once the basis for commercial production in the united states russia turkmenistan and ukraine currently commercial production is still carried out in the osiek mine in poland such sources are now of secondary commercial importance and most are no longer worked common naturally occurring sulfur compounds include the sulfide minerals such as pyrite iron sulfide cinnabar mercury sulfide galena lead sulfide sphalerite zinc sulfide and stibnite antimony sulfide and the sulfate minerals such as gypsum calcium sulfate alunite potassium aluminium sulfate and barite barium sulfate on earth just as upon jupiter s moon io elemental sulfur occurs naturally in volcanic emissions including emissions from hydrothermal vents the main industrial source of sulfur is now petroleum and natural gas compounds common oxidation states of sulfur range from to sulfur forms stable compounds with all elements except the noble gases allotropes sulfur forms over solid allotropes more than any other element besides s several other rings are known removing one atom from the crown gives s which is more of a deep yellow than the s hplc analysis of elemental sulfur reveals an equilibrium mixture of mainly s but with s and small amounts of s larger rings have been prepared including s and s amorphous or plastic sulfur is produced by rapid cooling of molten sulfur for example by pouring it into cold water x ray crystallography studies show that the amorphous form may have a helical structure with eight atoms per turn the long coiled polymeric molecules make the brownish substance elastic and in bulk this form has the feel of crude rubber this form is metastable at room temperature and gradually reverts to crystalline molecular allotrope which is no longer elastic this process happens within a matter of hours to days but can be rapidly catalyzed electron transfer reactions sulfur polycations s s and s are produced when sulfur is reacted with oxidising agents in a strongly acidic solution the colored solutions produced by dissolving sulfur in oleum were first reported as early as by c f bucholz but the cause of the color and the structure of the polycations involved was only determined in the late s s is deep blue s is yellow and s is red reduction of sulfur gives various polysulfides with the formula sx many of which have been obtained crystalline form illustrative is the production of sodium tetrasulfide na s na s some of these dianions dissociate to give radical anions such as s gives the blue color of the rock lapis lazuli this reaction highlights a distinctive property of sulfur its ability to catenate bind to itself by formation of chains protonation of these polysulfide anions produces the polysulfanes h sx where x and ultimately reduction of sulfur produces sulfide salts na s na sthe interconversion of these species is exploited in the sodium sulfur battery hydrogenation treatment of sulfur with hydrogen gives hydrogen sulfide when dissolved in water hydrogen sulfide is mildly acidic h s hs h hydrogen sulfide gas and the hydrosulfide anion are extremely toxic to mammals due to their inhibition of the oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin and certain cytochromes in a manner analogous to cyanide and azide see below under precautions combustion the two principal sulfur oxides are obtained by burning sulfur s o so sulfur dioxide so o so sulfur trioxide many other sulfur oxides are observed including the sulfur rich oxides include sulfur monoxide disulfur monoxide disulfur dioxides and higher oxides containing peroxo groups halogenation sulfur reacts with fluorine to give the highly reactive sulfur tetrafluoride and the highly inert sulfur hexafluoride whereas fluorine gives s iv and s vi compounds chlorine gives s ii and s i derivatives thus sulfur dichloride disulfur dichloride and higher chlorosulfanes arise from the chlorination of sulfur sulfuryl chloride and chlorosulfuric acid are derivatives of sulfuric acid thionyl chloride socl is a common reagent in organic synthesis pseudohalides sulfur oxidizes cyanide and sulfite to give thiocyanate and thiosulfate respectively metal sulfides sulfur reacts with many metals electropositive metals give polysulfide salts copper zinc silver are attacked by sulfur see tarnishing although many metal sulfides are known most are prepared by high temperature reactions of the elements organic compounds illustrative organosulfur compounds some of the main classes of sulfur containing organic compounds include the following thiols or mercaptans so called because they capture mercury as chelators are the sulfur analogs of alcohols treatment of thiols with base gives thiolate ions thioethers are the sulfur analogs of ethers sulfonium ions have three groups attached to a cationic sulfur center dimethylsulfoniopropionate dmsp is one such compound important in the marine organic sulfur cycle sulfoxides and sulfones are thioethers with one and two oxygen atoms attached to the sulfur atom respectively the simplest sulfoxide dimethyl sulfoxide is a common solvent a common sulfone is sulfolane sulfonic acids are used in many detergents compounds with carbon sulfur multiple bonds are uncommon an exception being carbon disulfide a volatile colorless liquid that is structurally similar to carbon dioxide it is used as a reagent to make the polymer rayon and many organosulfur compounds unlike carbon monoxide carbon monosulfide is stable only as an extremely dilute gas found between solar systems organosulfur compounds are responsible for some of the unpleasant odors of decaying organic matter they are widely known as the odorant in domestic natural gas garlic odor and skunk spray not all organic sulfur compounds smell unpleasant at all concentrations the sulfur containing monoterpenoid grapefruit mercaptan in small concentrations is the characteristic scent of grapefruit but has a generic thiol odor at larger concentrations sulfur mustard a potent vesicant was used in world war i as a disabling agent sulfur sulfur bonds are a structural component used to stiffen rubber similar to the disulfide bridges that rigidify proteins see biological below in the most common type of industrial curing or hardening and strengthening of natural rubber elemental sulfur is heated with the rubber to the point that chemical reactions form disulfide bridges between isoprene units of the polymer this process patented in made rubber a major industrial product especially in automobile tires because of the heat and sulfur the process was named vulcanization after the roman god of the forge and volcanism history antiquity being abundantly available in native form sulfur was known in ancient times and is referred to in the torah genesis english translations of the christian bible commonly referred to burning sulfur as brimstone giving rise to the term fire and brimstone sermons in which listeners are reminded of the fate of eternal damnation that await the unbelieving and unrepentant it is from this part of the bible that hell is implied to smell of sulfur likely due to its association with volcanic activity according to the ebers papyrus a sulfur ointment was used in ancient egypt to treat granular eyelids sulfur was used for fumigation in preclassical greece this is mentioned in the odyssey pliny the elder discusses sulfur in book of his natural history saying that its best known source is the island of melos he mentions its use for fumigation medicine and bleaching cloth a natural form of sulfur known as shiliuhuang was known in china since the th century bc and found in hanzhong by the rd century the chinese had discovered that sulfur could be extracted from pyrite chinese daoists were interested in sulfur s flammability and its reactivity with certain metals yet its earliest practical uses were found in traditional chinese medicine a song dynasty military treatise of ad described various formulas for chinese black powder which is a mixture of potassium nitrate kno charcoal and sulfur it remains an ingredient of black gunpowder indian alchemists practitioners of the science of chemicals sanskrit romanized rasa stra wrote extensively about the use of sulfur in alchemical operations with mercury from the eighth century ad onwards in the rasa stra tradition sulfur is called the smelly gandhaka early european alchemists gave sulfur a unique alchemical symbol a triangle atop a cross this is sometimes confused with the astronomical crossed spear symbol for pallas the variation known as brimstone has a symbol combining a two barred cross atop a lemniscate in traditional skin treatment elemental sulfur was used mainly in creams to alleviate such conditions as scabies ringworm psoriasis eczema and acne the mechanism of action is unknown though elemental sulfur does oxidize slowly to sulfurous acid which is through the action of sulfite a mild reducing and antibacterial agent modern times sulfur appears in a column of fixed non acidic alkali in a chemical table of antoine lavoisier used sulfur in combustion experiments writing of some of these in sulfur deposits in sicily were the dominant source for more than a century by the late th century about tonnes per year of sulfur were imported into marseille france for the production of sulfuric acid for use in the leblanc process in industrializing britain with the repeal of tariffs on salt in demand for sulfur from sicily surged upward the increasing british control and exploitation of the mining refining and transportation of the sulfur coupled with the failure of this lucrative export to transform sicily s backward and impoverished economy led to the sulfur crisis of when king ferdinand ii gave a monopoly of the sulfur industry to a french firm violating an earlier trade agreement with britain a peaceful solution was eventually negotiated by france in elemental sulfur was discovered in underground deposits in louisiana and texas the highly successful frasch process was developed to extract this resource in the late th century furniture makers used molten sulfur to produce decorative inlays molten sulfur is sometimes still used for setting steel bolts into drilled concrete holes where high shock resistance is desired for floor mounted equipment attachment points pure powdered sulfur was used as a medicinal tonic and laxative with the advent of the contact process the majority of sulfur today is used to make sulfuric acid for a wide range of uses particularly fertilizer in recent times the main source of sulfur has become petroleum and natural gas this is due to the requirement to remove sulfur from fuels in order to prevent acid rain and has resulted in a surplus of sulfur spelling and etymology sulfur is derived from the latin word sulpur which was hellenized to sulphur in the erroneous belief that the latin word came from greek this spelling was later reinterpreted as representing an f sound and resulted in the spelling sulfur which appears in latin toward the end of the classical period the true greek word for sulfur is the source of the international chemical prefix thio in th century anglo french it was sulfre in the th century the erroneously hellenized latin ph was restored in middle english sulphre by the th century both full latin spelling variants sulfur and sulphur became common in english the parallel f ph spellings continued in britain until the th century when the word was standardized as sulphur on the other hand sulfur was the form chosen in the united states whereas canada uses both the iupac adopted the spelling sulfur in or depending on the source cited as did the nomenclature committee of the royal society of chemistry in restoring the spelling sulfur to britain oxford dictionaries note that in chemistry and other technical uses the f spelling is now the standard form for this and related words in british as well as us contexts and is increasingly used in general contexts as well production sulfur may be found by itself and historically was usually obtained in this form pyrite has also been a source of sulfur in volcanic regions in sicily in ancient times it was found on the surface of the earth and the sicilian process was used sulfur deposits were piled and stacked in brick kilns built on sloping hillsides with airspaces between them then some sulfur was pulverized spread over the stacked ore and ignited causing the free sulfur to melt down the hills eventually the surface borne deposits played out and miners excavated veins that ultimately dotted the sicilian landscape with labyrinthine mines mining was unmechanized and labor intensive with pickmen freeing the ore from the rock and mine boys or carusi carrying baskets of ore to the surface often through a mile or more of tunnels once the ore was at the surface it was reduced and extracted in smelting ovens the conditions in sicilian sulfur mines were horrific prompting booker t washington to write i am not prepared just now to say to what extent i believe in a physical hell in the next world but a sulphur mine in sicily is about the nearest thing to hell that i expect to see in this life elemental sulfur was extracted from salt domes in which it sometimes occurs in nearly pure form until the late th century sulfur is now produced as a side product of other industrial processes such as in oil refining in which sulfur is undesired as a mineral native sulfur under salt domes is thought to be a fossil mineral resource produced by the action of anaerobic bacteria on sulfate deposits it was removed from such salt dome mines mainly by the frasch process in this method superheated water was pumped into a native sulfur deposit to melt the sulfur and then compressed air returned the pure melted product to the surface throughout the th century this procedure produced elemental sulfur that required no further purification due to a limited number of such sulfur deposits and the high cost of working them this process for mining sulfur has not been employed in a major way anywhere in the world since today sulfur is produced from petroleum natural gas and related fossil resources from which it is obtained mainly as hydrogen sulfide organosulfur compounds undesirable impurities in petroleum may be upgraded by subjecting them to hydrodesulfurization which cleaves the c s bonds r s r h rh h sthe resulting hydrogen sulfide from this process and also as it occurs in natural gas is converted into elemental sulfur by the claus process this process entails oxidation of some hydrogen sulfide to sulfur dioxide and then the comproportionation of the two o h s so h o so h s s h o owing to the high sulfur content of the athabasca oil sands stockpiles of elemental sulfur from this process now exist throughout alberta canada another way of storing sulfur is as a binder for concrete the resulting product having many desirable properties see sulfur concrete sulfur is still mined from surface deposits in poorer nations with volcanoes such as indonesia and worker conditions have not improved much since booker t washington s days the world production of sulfur in amounted to million tonnes mt with more than countries contributing more than mt each countries producing more than mt are china the united states canada and russia production has been slowly increasing from to the price was unstable in the s and around applications sulfuric acid elemental sulfur is used mainly as a precursor to other chemicals approximately is converted to sulfuric acid h so s o h o h so in the united states produced more sulfuric acid than any other inorganic industrial chemical the principal use for the acid is the extraction of phosphate ores for the production of fertilizer manufacturing other applications of sulfuric acid include oil refining wastewater processing and mineral extraction other important sulfur chemistry sulfur reacts directly with methane to give carbon disulfide which is used to manufacture cellophane and rayon one of the uses of elemental sulfur is in vulcanization of rubber where polysulfide chains crosslink organic polymers large quantities of sulfites are used to bleach paper and to preserve dried fruit many surfactants and detergents e g sodium lauryl sulfate are sulfate derivatives calcium sulfate gypsum caso h o is mined on the scale of million tonnes each year for use in portland cement and fertilizers when silver based photography was widespread sodium and ammonium thiosulfate were widely used as fixing agents sulfur is a component of gunpowder black powder fertilizer amino acids synthesized by living organisms such as methionine and cysteine contain organosulfur groups thioester and thiol respectively the antioxidant glutathione protecting many living organisms against free radicals and oxidative stress also contains organic sulfur some crops such as onion and garlic also produce different organosulfur compounds such as syn propanethial s oxide responsible of lacrymal irritation onions or diallyl disulfide and allicin garlic sulfates commonly found in soils and groundwaters are often a sufficient natural source of sulfur for plants and bacteria atmospheric deposition of sulfur dioxide so is also a common artificial source coal combustion of sulfur for the soils under normal circumstances in most agricultural soils sulfur is not a limiting nutrient for plants and microorganisms see the liebig s law of the minimum liebig s barrel however in some circumstance soils can be depleted in sulfate e g if this later is leached by meteoric water rain or if the requirements in sulfur for some types of crops are high this explains that sulfur is increasingly recognized and used as a component of fertilizers the most important form of sulfur for fertilizer is the calcium sulfate commonly found in nature as the mineral gypsum caso h o elemental sulfur is hydrophobic not soluble in water and cannot be used directly by plants elemental sulfur es is sometimes mixed with bentonite to amend depleted soils for crops with high requirement in organo sulfur over time oxidation abiotic processes with atmospheric oxygen and soil bacteria can oxidize and convert elemental sulfur to soluble derivatives which can then be used by microorganisms and plants sulfur improves the efficiency of other essential plant nutrients particularly nitrogen and phosphorus biologically produced sulfur particles are naturally hydrophilic due to a biopolymer coating and are easier to disperse over the land in a spray of diluted slurry resulting in a faster uptake by plants the plants requirement for sulfur equals or exceeds the requirement for phosphorus it is an essential nutrient for plant growth root nodule formation of legumes and immunity and defense systems sulfur deficiency has become widespread in many countries in europe because atmospheric inputs of sulfur continue to decrease the deficit in the sulfur input output is likely to increase unless sulfur fertilizers are used atmospheric inputs of sulfur decrease because of actions taken to limit acid rains fungicide and pesticide elemental sulfur is one of the oldest fungicides and pesticides dusting sulfur elemental sulfur in powdered form is a common fungicide for grapes strawberry many vegetables and several other crops it has a good efficacy against a wide range of powdery mildew diseases as well as black spot in organic production sulfur is the most important fungicide it is the only fungicide used in organically farmed apple production against the main disease apple scab under colder conditions biosulfur biologically produced elemental sulfur with hydrophilic characteristics can also be used for these applications standard formulation dusting sulfur is applied to crops with a sulfur duster or from a dusting plane wettable sulfur is the commercial name for dusting sulfur formulated with additional ingredients to make it water miscible it has similar applications and is used as a fungicide against mildew and other mold related problems with plants and soil elemental sulfur powder is used as an organic i e green insecticide actually an acaricide against ticks and mites a common method of application is dusting the clothing or limbs with sulfur powder a diluted solution of lime sulfur made by combining calcium hydroxide with elemental sulfur in water is used as a dip for pets to destroy ringworm fungus mange and other dermatoses and parasites sulfur candles of almost pure sulfur were burned to fumigate structures and wine barrels but are now considered too toxic for residences pharmaceuticals sulfur specifically octasulfur s is used in pharmaceutical skin preparations for the treatment of acne and other conditions it acts as a keratolytic agent and also kills bacteria fungi scabies mites and other parasites precipitated sulfur and colloidal sulfur are used in form of lotions creams powders soaps and bath additives for the treatment of acne vulgaris acne rosacea and seborrhoeic dermatitis many drugs contain sulfur early examples include antibacterial sulfonamides known as sulfa drugs a more recent example is mucolytic acetylcysteine sulfur is a part of many bacterial defense molecules most lactam antibiotics including the penicillins cephalosporins and monobactams contain sulfur batteries due to their high energy density and the availability of sulfur there is ongoing research in creating rechargeable lithium sulfur batteries until now carbonate electrolytes have caused failures in such batteries after a single cycle in february researchers at drexel university have not only created a prototypical battery that lasted recharge cycles but also found the first monoclinic gamma sulfur that remained stable below degrees celsius biological role sulfur is an essential component of all living cells it is the eighth most abundant element in the human body by weight about equal in abundance to potassium and slightly greater than sodium and chlorine a kg lb human body contains about grams of sulfur the main dietary source of sulfur for humans is sulfur containing amino acids which can be found in plant and animal proteins transferring sulfur between inorganic and biomolecules in the s while studying beggiatoa a bacterium living in a sulfur rich environment sergei winogradsky found that it oxidized hydrogen sulfide h s as an energy source forming intracellular sulfur droplets winogradsky referred to this form of metabolism as inorgoxidation oxidation of inorganic compounds another contributor who continued to study it was selman waksman primitive bacteria that live around deep ocean volcanic vents oxidize hydrogen sulfide for their nutrition as discovered by robert ballard sulfur oxidizers can use as energy sources reduced sulfur compounds including hydrogen sulfide elemental sulfur sulfite thiosulfate and various polythionates e g tetrathionate they depend on enzymes such as sulfur oxygenase and sulfite oxidase to oxidize sulfur to sulfate some lithotrophs can even use the energy contained in sulfur compounds to produce sugars a process known as chemosynthesis some bacteria and archaea use hydrogen sulfide in place of water as the electron donor in chemosynthesis a process similar to photosynthesis that produces sugars and uses oxygen as the electron acceptor sulfur based chemosynthesis may be simplifiedly compared with photosynthesis h s co sugars sh o co sugars o there are bacteria combining these two ways of nutrition green sulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria also sulfur oxidizing bacteria can go into symbiosis with larger organisms enabling the later to use hydrogen sulfide as food to be oxidized example the giant tube worm there are sulfate reducing bacteria that by contrast breathe sulfate instead of oxygen they use organic compounds or molecular hydrogen as the energy source they use sulfur as the electron acceptor and reduce various oxidized sulfur compounds back into sulfide often into hydrogen sulfide they can grow on other partially oxidized sulfur compounds e g thiosulfates thionates polysulfides sulfites there are studies pointing that many deposits of native sulfur in places that were the bottom of the ancient oceans have biological origin these studies indicate that this native sulfur have been obtained through biological activity but what is responsible for that sulfur oxidizing bacteria or sulfate reducing bacteria is still unknown for sure sulfur is absorbed by plants roots from soil as sulfate and transported as a phosphate ester sulfate is reduced to sulfide via sulfite before it is incorporated into cysteine and other organosulfur compounds so so h s cysteine thiol methionine thioether while the plants role in transferring sulfur to animals by food chains is more or less understood the role of sulfur bacteria is just getting investigated protein and organic metabolites in all forms of life most of the sulfur is contained in two proteinogenic amino acids cysteine and methionine thus the element is present in all proteins that contain these amino acids as well as in respective peptides some of the sulfur is comprised in certain metabolites many of which are cofactors and sulfated polysaccharides of connective tissue chondroitin sulfates heparin proteins to execute their biological function need to have specific space geometry formation of this geometry is performed in a process called protein folding and is provided by intra and inter molecular bonds the process has several stages while at premier stages a polypeptide chain folds due to hydrogen bonds at later stages folding is provided apart from hydrogen bonds by covalent bonds between two sulfur atoms of two cysteine residues so called disulfide bridges at different places of a chain tertriary protein structure as well as between two cysteine residues in two separated protein subunits quaternary protein structure both structures easily may be seen in insulin as the bond energy of a covalent disulfide bridge is higher than the energy of a coordinate bond or hydrophylic either hydrophobic interaction the higher disulfide bridges content leads the higher energy needed for protein denaturation in general disulfide bonds are necessary in proteins functioning outside cellular space and they don t change proteins conformation geometry but serve as its stabilizers within cytoplasm cysteine residues of proteins are saved in reduced state i e in sh form by thioredoxins this property manifests in following examples lysozyme is stable enough to be applied as a drug feathers and hair have relative strength and consisting in them keratin is considered indigestible by most organisms however there are fungi and bacteria containing keratinase and are able to destruct keratin many important cellular enzymes use prosthetic groups ending with sh moieties to handle reactions involving acyl containing biochemicals two common examples from basic metabolism are coenzyme a and alpha lipoic acid cysteine related metabolites homocysteine and taurine are other sulfur containing amino acids that are similar in structure but not coded by dna and are not part of the primary structure of proteins take part in various locations of mammalian physiology two of the classical vitamins biotin and thiamine contain sulfur and serve as cofactors to several enzymes in intracellular chemistry sulfur operates as a carrier of reducing hydrogen and its electrons for cellular repair of oxidation reduced glutathione a sulfur containing tripeptide is a reducing agent through its sulfhydryl sh moiety derived from cysteine methanogenesis the route to most of the world s methane is a multistep biochemical transformation of carbon dioxide this conversion requires several organosulfur cofactors these include coenzyme m ch sch ch so the immediate precursor to methane metalloproteins and inorganic cofactors metalloproteins in which the active site is a transition metal ion or metal sulfide cluster often coordinated by sulfur atoms of cysteine residues are essential components of enzymes involved in electron transfer processes examples include plastocyanin cu and nitrous oxide reductase cu s the function of these enzymes is dependent on the fact that the transition metal ion can undergo redox reactions other examples include many zinc proteins as well as iron sulfur clusters most pervasive are the ferrodoxins which serve as electron shuttles in cells in bacteria the important nitrogenase enzymes contains an fe mo s cluster and is a catalyst that performs the important function of nitrogen fixation converting atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia that can be used by microorganisms and plants to make proteins dna rna alkaloids and the other organic nitrogen compounds necessary for life deficiency in humans methionine is an essential amino acid cysteine is conditionally essential and may be synthesized from non essential serine sulfur donator would be methionine in this case dietary deficiency rarely happens in common conditions artificial methionine deficiency is attempted to apply in cancer treatment but the method is still potentially dangerous there is a rare fatal genetic disease connected with sulfite oxidase impairment an enzyme metabolizing sulfur containing amino acids precautions elemental sulfur is non toxic when one touches it however it isn t harmless inhaling sulfur dust or its contacting to eyes and or skin may cause irritation ingesting sulfur isn t safe too there are reports of cases where people deliberately consumed sulfur as a folk remedy that led to life threatening metabolic acidosis toxicity of sulfur compounds most of the soluble sulfate salts such as epsom salts are non toxic soluble sulfate salts are poorly absorbed and laxative when injected parenterally they are freely filtered by the kidneys and eliminated with very little toxicity in multi gram amounts aluminium sulfate is used in the purification of drinking water wastewater treatment plants and papermaking when sulfur burns in air it produces sulfur dioxide in water this gas produces sulfurous acid and sulfites sulfites are antioxidants that inhibit growth of aerobic bacteria and a useful food additive in small amounts at high concentrations these acids harm the lungs eyes or other tissues in organisms without lungs such as insects or plants sulfite in high concentration prevents respiration sulfur trioxide made by catalysis from sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid are similarly highly acidic and corrosive in the presence of water sulfuric acid is a strong dehydrating agent that can strip available water molecules and water components from sugar and organic tissue the burning of coal and or petroleum by industry and power plants generates sulfur dioxide so that reacts with atmospheric water and oxygen to produce sulfuric acid h so and sulfurous acid h so these acids are components of acid rain lowering the ph of soil and freshwater bodies sometimes resulting in substantial damage to the environment and chemical weathering of statues and structures fuel standards increasingly require that fuel producers extract sulfur from fossil fuels to prevent acid rain formation this extracted and refined sulfur represents a large portion of sulfur production in coal fired power plants flue gases are sometimes purified more modern power plants that use synthesis gas extract the sulfur before they burn the gas hydrogen sulfide is about one half as toxic as hydrogen cyanide and intoxicates by the same mechanism inhibition of the respiratory enzyme cytochrome oxidase though hydrogen sulfide is less likely to cause sudden poisonings from small inhaled amounts near its permissible exposure limit pel of ppm because of its disagreeable odor however its presence in ambient air at concentration over ppm quickly deadens the sense of smell and a victim may breathe increasing quantities without noticing until severe symptoms cause death dissolved sulfide and hydrosulfide salts are toxic by the same mechanism ,16
Chlorine,Cl,chlorine is a chemical element with the symbol cl and atomic number the second lightest of the halogens it appears between fluorine and bromine in the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between them chlorine is a yellow green gas at room temperature it is an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent among the elements it has the highest electron affinity and the third highest electronegativity on the revised pauling scale behind only oxygen and fluorine chlorine played an important role in the experiments conducted by medieval alchemists which commonly involved the heating of chloride salts like ammonium chloride sal ammoniac and sodium chloride common salt producing various chemical substances containing chlorine such as hydrogen chloride mercury ii chloride corrosive sublimate and hydrochloric acid in the form of aqua regia however the nature of free chlorine gas as a separate substance was only recognised around by jan baptist van helmont carl wilhelm scheele wrote a description of chlorine gas in supposing it to be an oxide of a new element in chemists suggested that the gas might be a pure element and this was confirmed by sir humphry davy in who named it after the ancient greek khl r s pale green because of its colour because of its great reactivity all chlorine in the earth s crust is in the form of ionic chloride compounds which includes table salt it is the second most abundant halogen after fluorine and twenty first most abundant chemical element in earth s crust these crustal deposits are nevertheless dwarfed by the huge reserves of chloride in seawater elemental chlorine is commercially produced from brine by electrolysis predominantly in the chlor alkali process the high oxidising potential of elemental chlorine led to the development of commercial bleaches and disinfectants and a reagent for many processes in the chemical industry chlorine is used in the manufacture of a wide range of consumer products about two thirds of them organic chemicals such as polyvinyl chloride pvc many intermediates for the production of plastics and other end products which do not contain the element as a common disinfectant elemental chlorine and chlorine generating compounds are used more directly in swimming pools to keep them sanitary elemental chlorine at high concentration is extremely dangerous and poisonous to most living organisms as a chemical warfare agent chlorine was first used in world war i as a poison gas weapon in the form of chloride ions chlorine is necessary to all known species of life other types of chlorine compounds are rare in living organisms and artificially produced chlorinated organics range from inert to toxic in the upper atmosphere chlorine containing organic molecules such as chlorofluorocarbons have been implicated in ozone depletion small quantities of elemental chlorine are generated by oxidation of chloride ions in neutrophils as part of an immune system response against bacteria history the most common compound of chlorine sodium chloride has been known since ancient times archaeologists have found evidence that rock salt was used as early as bc and brine as early as bc early discoveries around the authors of the arabic writings attributed to jabir ibn hayyan latin geber and the persian physician and alchemist abu bakr al razi c latin rhazes were experimenting with sal ammoniac ammonium chloride which when it was distilled together with vitriol hydrated sulfates of various metals produced hydrogen chloride however it appears that in these early experiments with chloride salts the gaseous products were discarded and hydrogen chloride may have been produced many times before it was discovered that it can be put to chemical use one of the first such uses was the synthesis of mercury ii chloride corrosive sublimate whose production from the heating of mercury either with alum and ammonium chloride or with vitriol and sodium chloride was first described in the de aluminibus et salibus on alums and salts an eleventh or twelfth century arabic text falsely attributed to abu bakr al razi and translated into latin in the second half of the twelfth century by gerard of cremona another important development was the discovery by pseudo geber in the de inventione veritatis on the discovery of truth after c that by adding ammonium chloride to nitric acid a strong solvent capable of dissolving gold i e aqua regia could be produced although aqua regia is an unstable mixture that continually gives off fumes containing free chlorine gas this chlorine gas appears to have been ignored until c when its nature as a separate gaseous substance was recognised by the brabantian chemist and physician jan baptist van helmont isolation the element was first studied in detail in by swedish chemist carl wilhelm scheele and he is credited with the discovery scheele produced chlorine by reacting mno as the mineral pyrolusite with hcl hcl mno mncl h o cl scheele observed several of the properties of chlorine the bleaching effect on litmus the deadly effect on insects the yellow green color and the smell similar to aqua regia he called it dephlogisticated muriatic acid air since it is a gas then called airs and it came from hydrochloric acid then known as muriatic acid he failed to establish chlorine as an element common chemical theory at that time held that an acid is a compound that contains oxygen remnants of this survive in the german and dutch names of oxygen sauerstoff or zuurstof both translating into english as acid substance so a number of chemists including claude berthollet suggested that scheele s dephlogisticated muriatic acid air must be a combination of oxygen and the yet undiscovered element muriaticum in joseph louis gay lussac and louis jacques th nard tried to decompose dephlogisticated muriatic acid air by reacting it with charcoal to release the free element muriaticum and carbon dioxide they did not succeed and published a report in which they considered the possibility that dephlogisticated muriatic acid air is an element but were not convinced in sir humphry davy tried the same experiment again and concluded that the substance was an element and not a compound he announced his results to the royal society on november that year at that time he named this new element chlorine from the greek word chl ros green yellow in reference to its color the name halogen meaning salt producer was originally used for chlorine in by johann salomo christoph schweigger this term was later used as a generic term to describe all the elements in the chlorine family fluorine bromine iodine after a suggestion by j ns jakob berzelius in in michael faraday liquefied chlorine for the first time and demonstrated that what was then known as solid chlorine had a structure of chlorine hydrate cl h o later uses chlorine gas was first used by french chemist claude berthollet to bleach textiles in modern bleaches resulted from further work by berthollet who first produced sodium hypochlorite in in his laboratory in the town of javel now part of paris france by passing chlorine gas through a solution of sodium carbonate the resulting liquid known as eau de javel javel water was a weak solution of sodium hypochlorite this process was not very efficient and alternative production methods were sought scottish chemist and industrialist charles tennant first produced a solution of calcium hypochlorite chlorinated lime then solid calcium hypochlorite bleaching powder these compounds produced low levels of elemental chlorine and could be more efficiently transported than sodium hypochlorite which remained as dilute solutions because when purified to eliminate water it became a dangerously powerful and unstable oxidizer near the end of the nineteenth century e s smith patented a method of sodium hypochlorite production involving electrolysis of brine to produce sodium hydroxide and chlorine gas which then mixed to form sodium hypochlorite this is known as the chloralkali process first introduced on an industrial scale in and now the source of most elemental chlorine and sodium hydroxide in chemischen fabrik griesheim of germany developed another chloralkali process which entered commercial production in elemental chlorine solutions dissolved in chemically basic water sodium and calcium hypochlorite were first used as anti putrefaction agents and disinfectants in the s in france long before the establishment of the germ theory of disease this practice was pioneered by antoine germain labarraque who adapted berthollet s javel water bleach and other chlorine preparations for a more complete history see below elemental chlorine has since served a continuous function in topical antisepsis wound irrigation solutions and the like and public sanitation particularly in swimming and drinking water chlorine gas was first used as a weapon on april at ypres by the german army the effect on the allies was devastating because the existing gas masks were difficult to deploy and had not been broadly distributed properties chlorine is the second halogen being a nonmetal in group of the periodic table its properties are thus similar to fluorine bromine and iodine and are largely intermediate between those of the first two chlorine has the electron configuration ne s p with the seven electrons in the third and outermost shell acting as its valence electrons like all halogens it is thus one electron short of a full octet and is hence a strong oxidising agent reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell corresponding to periodic trends it is intermediate in electronegativity between fluorine and bromine f cl br i and is less reactive than fluorine and more reactive than bromine it is also a weaker oxidising agent than fluorine but a stronger one than bromine conversely the chloride ion is a weaker reducing agent than bromide but a stronger one than fluoride it is intermediate in atomic radius between fluorine and bromine and this leads to many of its atomic properties similarly continuing the trend from iodine to bromine upward such as first ionisation energy electron affinity enthalpy of dissociation of the x molecule x cl br i ionic radius and x x bond length fluorine is anomalous due to its small size all four stable halogens experience intermolecular van der waals forces of attraction and their strength increases together with the number of electrons among all homonuclear diatomic halogen molecules thus the melting and boiling points of chlorine are intermediate between those of fluorine and bromine chlorine melts at c and boils at c as a result of the increasing molecular weight of the halogens down the group the density and heats of fusion and vaporisation of chlorine are again intermediate between those of bromine and fluorine although all their heats of vaporisation are fairly low leading to high volatility thanks to their diatomic molecular structure the halogens darken in colour as the group is descended thus while fluorine is a pale yellow gas chlorine is distinctly yellow green this trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group specifically the colour of a halogen such as chlorine results from the electron transition between the highest occupied antibonding g molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding u molecular orbital the colour fades at low temperatures so that solid chlorine at c is almost colourless like solid bromine and iodine solid chlorine crystallises in the orthorhombic crystal system in a layered lattice of cl molecules the cl cl distance is pm close to the gaseous cl cl distance of pm and the cl cl distance between molecules is pm within a layer and pm between layers compare the van der waals radius of chlorine pm this structure means that chlorine is a very poor conductor of electricity and indeed its conductivity is so low as to be practically unmeasurable isotopes chlorine has two stable isotopes cl and cl these are its only two natural isotopes occurring in quantity with cl making up of natural chlorine and cl making up the remaining both are synthesised in stars in the oxygen burning and silicon burning processes both have nuclear spin and thus may be used for nuclear magnetic resonance although the spin magnitude being greater than results in non spherical nuclear charge distribution and thus resonance broadening as a result of a nonzero nuclear quadrupole moment and resultant quadrupolar relaxation the other chlorine isotopes are all radioactive with half lives too short to occur in nature primordially of these the most commonly used in the laboratory are cl t y and cl t min which may be produced from the neutron activation of natural chlorine the most stable chlorine radioisotope is cl the primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than cl is electron capture to isotopes of sulfur that of isotopes heavier than cl is beta decay to isotopes of argon and cl may decay by either mode to stable s or ar cl occurs in trace quantities in nature as a cosmogenic nuclide in a ratio of about to with stable chlorine isotopes it is produced in the atmosphere by spallation of ar by interactions with cosmic ray protons in the top meter of the lithosphere cl is generated primarily by thermal neutron activation of cl and spallation of k and ca in the subsurface environment muon capture by ca becomes more important as a way to generate cl chemistry and compounds chlorine is intermediate in reactivity between fluorine and bromine and is one of the most reactive elements chlorine is a weaker oxidising agent than fluorine but a stronger one than bromine or iodine this can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the x x couples f v cl v br v i v at approximately v however this trend is not shown in the bond energies because fluorine is singular due to its small size low polarisability and inability to show hypervalence as another difference chlorine has a significant chemistry in positive oxidation states while fluorine does not chlorination often leads to higher oxidation states than bromination or iodination but lower oxidation states than fluorination chlorine tends to react with compounds including m m m h or m c bonds to form m cl bonds given that e o h o v which is less than v it would be expected that chlorine should be able to oxidise water to oxygen and hydrochloric acid however the kinetics of this reaction are unfavorable and there is also a bubble overpotential effect to consider so that electrolysis of aqueous chloride solutions evolves chlorine gas and not oxygen gas a fact that is very useful for the industrial production of chlorine hydrogen chloride the simplest chlorine compound is hydrogen chloride hcl a major chemical in industry as well as in the laboratory both as a gas and dissolved in water as hydrochloric acid it is often produced by burning hydrogen gas in chlorine gas or as a byproduct of chlorinating hydrocarbons another approach is to treat sodium chloride with concentrated sulfuric acid to produce hydrochloric acid also known as the salt cake process nacl h so c nahso hcl nacl nahso c na so hclin the laboratory hydrogen chloride gas may be made by drying the acid with concentrated sulfuric acid deuterium chloride dcl may be produced by reacting benzoyl chloride with heavy water d o at room temperature hydrogen chloride is a colourless gas like all the hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the larger electronegative chlorine atom however weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline hydrogen chloride at low temperatures similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised hydrochloric acid is a strong acid pka because the hydrogen bonds to chlorine are too weak to inhibit dissociation the hcl h o system has many hydrates hcl nh o for n and beyond a mixture of hcl and h o the system separates completely into two separate liquid phases hydrochloric acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point c at g hcl per g solution thus hydrochloric acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation unlike hydrogen fluoride anhydrous liquid hydrogen chloride is difficult to work with as a solvent because its boiling point is low it has a small liquid range its dielectric constant is low and it does not dissociate appreciably into h cl and hcl ions the latter in any case are much less stable than the bifluoride ions hf due to the very weak hydrogen bonding between hydrogen and chlorine though its salts with very large and weakly polarising cations such as cs and nr r me et bun may still be isolated anhydrous hydrogen chloride is a poor solvent only able to dissolve small molecular compounds such as nitrosyl chloride and phenol or salts with very low lattice energies such as tetraalkylammonium halides it readily protonates electrophiles containing lone pairs or bonds solvolysis ligand replacement reactions and oxidations are well characterised in hydrogen chloride solution ph sncl hcl ph sncl phh solvolysis ph coh hcl ph c hcl h o cl solvolysis me n hcl bcl me n bcl hcl ligand replacement pcl cl hcl pcl hcl oxidation other binary chlorides nearly all elements in the periodic table form binary chlorides the exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions the noble gases with the exception of xenon in the highly unstable xecl and xecl extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation many of the heaviest elements beyond bismuth and having an electronegativity higher than chlorine s oxygen and fluorine so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not chlorides but rather oxides or fluorides of chlorine even though nitrogen in ncl is bearing a negative charge the compound is usually called nitrogen trichloride chlorination of metals with cl usually leads to a higher oxidation state than bromination with br when multiple oxidation states are available such as in mocl and mobr chlorides can be made by reaction of an element or its oxide hydroxide or carbonate with hydrochloric acid and then dehydrated by mildly high temperatures combined with either low pressure or anhydrous hydrogen chloride gas these methods work best when the chloride product is stable to hydrolysis otherwise the possibilities include high temperature oxidative chlorination of the element with chlorine or hydrogen chloride high temperature chlorination of a metal oxide or other halide by chlorine a volatile metal chloride carbon tetrachloride or an organic chloride for instance zirconium dioxide reacts with chlorine at standard conditions to produce zirconium tetrachloride and uranium trioxide reacts with hexachloropropene when heated under reflux to give uranium tetrachloride the second example also involves a reduction in oxidation state which can also be achieved by reducing a higher chloride using hydrogen or a metal as a reducing agent this may also be achieved by thermal decomposition or disproportionation as follows eucl h eucl hcl recl at bp recl cl aucl c aucl cl most metal chlorides with the metal in low oxidation states to are ionic nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular chlorides as do metals in high oxidation states from and above both ionic and covalent chlorides are known for metals in oxidation state e g scandium chloride is mostly ionic but aluminium chloride is not silver chloride is very insoluble in water and is thus often used as a qualitative test for chlorine polychlorine compounds although dichlorine is a strong oxidising agent with a high first ionisation energy it may be oxidised under extreme conditions to form the cl cation this is very unstable and has only been characterised by its electronic band spectrum when produced in a low pressure discharge tube the yellow cl cation is more stable and may be produced as follows cl clf asf c cl asf this reaction is conducted in the oxidising solvent arsenic pentafluoride the trichloride anion cl has also been characterised it is analogous to triiodide chlorine fluorides the three fluorides of chlorine form a subset of the interhalogen compounds all of which are diamagnetic some cationic and anionic derivatives are known such as clf clf clf and cl f some pseudohalides of chlorine are also known such as cyanogen chloride clcn linear chlorine cyanate clnco chlorine thiocyanate clscn unlike its oxygen counterpart and chlorine azide cln chlorine monofluoride clf is extremely thermally stable and is sold commercially in gram steel lecture bottles it is a colourless gas that melts at c and boils at c it may be produced by the direction of its elements at c though it must then be separated and purified from chlorine trifluoride and its reactants its properties are mostly intermediate between those of chlorine and fluorine it will react with many metals and nonmetals from room temperature and above fluorinating them and liberating chlorine it will also act as a chlorofluorinating agent adding chlorine and fluorine across a multiple bond or by oxidation for example it will attack carbon monoxide to form carbonyl chlorofluoride cofcl it will react analogously with hexafluoroacetone cf co with a potassium fluoride catalyst to produce heptafluoroisopropyl hypochlorite cf cfocl with nitriles rcn to produce rcf ncl and with the sulfur oxides so and so to produce clso f and closo f respectively it will also react exothermically with compounds containing oh and nh groups such as water h o clf hf cl ochlorine trifluoride clf is a volatile colourless molecular liquid which melts at c and boils at c it may be formed by directly fluorinating gaseous chlorine or chlorine monofluoride at c one of the most reactive chemical compounds known the list of elements it sets on fire is diverse containing hydrogen potassium phosphorus arsenic antimony sulfur selenium tellurium bromine iodine and powdered molybdenum tungsten rhodium iridium and iron it will also ignite water along with many substances which in ordinary circumstances would be considered chemically inert such as asbestos concrete glass and sand when heated it will even corrode noble metals as palladium platinum and gold and even the noble gases xenon and radon do not escape fluorination an impermeable fluoride layer is formed by sodium magnesium aluminium zinc tin and silver which may be removed by heating nickel copper and steel containers are usually used due to their great resistance to attack by chlorine trifluoride stemming from the formation of an unreactive layer of metal fluoride its reaction with hydrazine to form hydrogen fluoride nitrogen and chlorine gases was used in experimental rocket engine but has problems largely stemming from its extreme hypergolicity resulting in ignition without any measurable delay today it is mostly used in nuclear fuel processing to oxidise uranium to uranium hexafluoride for its enriching and to separate it from plutonium as well as in the semiconductor industry where it is used to clean chemical vapor deposition chambers it can act as a fluoride ion donor or acceptor lewis base or acid although it does not dissociate appreciably into clf and clf ions chlorine pentafluoride clf is made on a large scale by direct fluorination of chlorine with excess fluorine gas at c and atm and on a small scale by reacting metal chlorides with fluorine gas at c it melts at c and boils at c it is a very strong fluorinating agent although it is still not as effective as chlorine trifluoride only a few specific stoichiometric reactions have been characterised arsenic pentafluoride and antimony pentafluoride form ionic adducts of the form clf mf m as sb and water reacts vigorously as follows h o clf hf fclo the product chloryl fluoride is one of the five known chlorine oxide fluorides these range from the thermally unstable fclo to the chemically unreactive perchloryl fluoride fclo the other three being fclo f clo and f clo all five behave similarly to the chlorine fluorides both structurally and chemically and may act as lewis acids or bases by gaining or losing fluoride ions respectively or as very strong oxidising and fluorinating agents chlorine oxides the chlorine oxides are well studied in spite of their instability all of them are endothermic compounds they are important because they are produced when chlorofluorocarbons undergo photolysis in the upper atmosphere and cause the destruction of the ozone layer none of them can be made from directly reacting the elements dichlorine monoxide cl o is a brownish yellow gas red brown when solid or liquid which may be obtained by reacting chlorine gas with yellow mercury ii oxide it is very soluble in water in which it is in equilibrium with hypochlorous acid hocl of which it is the anhydride it is thus an effective bleach and is mostly used to make hypochlorites it explodes on heating or sparking or in the presence of ammonia gas chlorine dioxide clo was the first chlorine oxide to be discovered in by humphry davy it is a yellow paramagnetic gas deep red as a solid or liquid as expected from its having an odd number of electrons it is stable towards dimerisation due to the delocalisation of the unpaired electron it explodes above c as a liquid and under pressure as a gas and therefore must be made at low concentrations for wood pulp bleaching and water treatment it is usually prepared by reducing a chlorate as follows clo cl h clo cl h oits production is thus intimately linked to the redox reactions of the chlorine oxoacids it is a strong oxidising agent reacting with sulfur phosphorus phosphorus halides and potassium borohydride it dissolves exothermically in water to form dark green solutions that very slowly decompose in the dark crystalline clathrate hydrates clo nh o n separate out at low temperatures however in the presence of light these solutions rapidly photodecompose to form a mixture of chloric and hydrochloric acids photolysis of individual clo molecules result in the radicals clo and cloo while at room temperature mostly chlorine oxygen and some clo and cl o are produced cl o is also produced when photolysing the solid at c it is a dark brown solid that explodes below c the clo radical leads to the depletion of atmospheric ozone and is thus environmentally important as follows cl o clo o clo o cl o chlorine perchlorate cloclo is a pale yellow liquid that is less stable than clo and decomposes at room temperature to form chlorine oxygen and dichlorine hexoxide cl o chlorine perchlorate may also be considered a chlorine derivative of perchloric acid hoclo similar to the thermally unstable chlorine derivatives of other oxoacids examples include chlorine nitrate clono vigorously reactive and explosive and chlorine fluorosulfate closo f more stable but still moisture sensitive and highly reactive dichlorine hexoxide is a dark red liquid that freezes to form a solid which turns yellow at c it is usually made by reaction of chlorine dioxide with oxygen despite attempts to rationalise it as the dimer of clo it reacts more as though it were chloryl perchlorate clo clo which has been confirmed to be the correct structure of the solid it hydrolyses in water to give a mixture of chloric and perchloric acids the analogous reaction with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride does not proceed to completion dichlorine heptoxide cl o is the anhydride of perchloric acid hclo and can readily be obtained from it by dehydrating it with phosphoric acid at c and then distilling the product at c and mmhg it is a shock sensitive colourless oily liquid it is the least reactive of the chlorine oxides being the only one to not set organic materials on fire at room temperature it may be dissolved in water to regenerate perchloric acid or in aqueous alkalis to regenerate perchlorates however it thermally decomposes explosively by breaking one of the central cl o bonds producing the radicals clo and clo which immediately decompose to the elements through intermediate oxides chlorine oxoacids and oxyanions chlorine forms four oxoacids hypochlorous acid hocl chlorous acid hoclo chloric acid hoclo and perchloric acid hoclo as can be seen from the redox potentials given in the adjacent table chlorine is much more stable towards disproportionation in acidic solutions than in alkaline solutions the hypochlorite ions also disproportionate further to produce chloride and chlorate clo cl clo but this reaction is quite slow at temperatures below c in spite of the very favourable equilibrium constant of the chlorate ions may themselves disproportionate to form chloride and perchlorate clo cl clo but this is still very slow even at c despite the very favourable equilibrium constant of the rates of reaction for the chlorine oxyanions increases as the oxidation state of chlorine decreases the strengths of the chlorine oxyacids increase very quickly as the oxidation state of chlorine increases due to the increasing delocalisation of charge over more and more oxygen atoms in their conjugate bases most of the chlorine oxoacids may be produced by exploiting these disproportionation reactions hypochlorous acid hocl is highly reactive and quite unstable its salts are mostly used for their bleaching and sterilising abilities they are very strong oxidising agents transferring an oxygen atom to most inorganic species chlorous acid hoclo is even more unstable and cannot be isolated or concentrated without decomposition it is known from the decomposition of aqueous chlorine dioxide however sodium chlorite is a stable salt and is useful for bleaching and stripping textiles as an oxidising agent and as a source of chlorine dioxide chloric acid hoclo is a strong acid that is quite stable in cold water up to concentration but on warming gives chlorine and chlorine dioxide evaporation under reduced pressure allows it to be concentrated further to about but then it decomposes to perchloric acid chlorine oxygen water and chlorine dioxide its most important salt is sodium chlorate mostly used to make chlorine dioxide to bleach paper pulp the decomposition of chlorate to chloride and oxygen is a common way to produce oxygen in the laboratory on a small scale chloride and chlorate may comproportionate to form chlorine as follows clo cl h cl h operchlorates and perchloric acid hoclo are the most stable oxo compounds of chlorine in keeping with the fact that chlorine compounds are most stable when the chlorine atom is in its lowest or highest possible oxidation states perchloric acid and aqueous perchlorates are vigorous and sometimes violent oxidising agents when heated in stark contrast to their mostly inactive nature at room temperature due to the high activation energies for these reactions for kinetic reasons perchlorates are made by electrolytically oxidising sodium chlorate and perchloric acid is made by reacting anhydrous sodium perchlorate or barium perchlorate with concentrated hydrochloric acid filtering away the chloride precipitated and distilling the filtrate to concentrate it anhydrous perchloric acid is a colourless mobile liquid that is sensitive to shock that explodes on contact with most organic compounds sets hydrogen iodide and thionyl chloride on fire and even oxidises silver and gold although it is a weak ligand weaker than water a few compounds involving coordinated clo are known organochlorine compounds like the other carbon halogen bonds the c cl bond is a common functional group that forms part of core organic chemistry formally compounds with this functional group may be considered organic derivatives of the chloride anion due to the difference of electronegativity between chlorine and carbon the carbon in a c cl bond is electron deficient and thus electrophilic chlorination modifies the physical properties of hydrocarbons in several ways chlorocarbons are typically denser than water due to the higher atomic weight of chlorine versus hydrogen and aliphatic organochlorides are alkylating agents because chloride is a leaving group alkanes and aryl alkanes may be chlorinated under free radical conditions with uv light however the extent of chlorination is difficult to control the reaction is not regioselective and often results in a mixture of various isomers with different degrees of chlorination though this may be permissible if the products are easily separated aryl chlorides may be prepared by the friedel crafts halogenation using chlorine and a lewis acid catalyst the haloform reaction using chlorine and sodium hydroxide is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones and related compounds chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well giving di or tetra chloro compounds however due to the expense and reactivity of chlorine organochlorine compounds are more commonly produced by using hydrogen chloride or with chlorinating agents such as phosphorus pentachloride pcl or thionyl chloride socl the last is very convenient in the laboratory because all side products are gaseous and do not have to be distilled out many organochlorine compounds have been isolated from natural sources ranging from bacteria to humans chlorinated organic compounds are found in nearly every class of biomolecules including alkaloids terpenes amino acids flavonoids steroids and fatty acids organochlorides including dioxins are produced in the high temperature environment of forest fires and dioxins have been found in the preserved ashes of lightning ignited fires that predate synthetic dioxins in addition a variety of simple chlorinated hydrocarbons including dichloromethane chloroform and carbon tetrachloride have been isolated from marine algae a majority of the chloromethane in the environment is produced naturally by biological decomposition forest fires and volcanoes some types of organochlorides though not all have significant toxicity to plants or animals including humans dioxins produced when organic matter is burned in the presence of chlorine and some insecticides such as ddt are persistent organic pollutants which pose dangers when they are released into the environment for example ddt which was widely used to control insects in the mid th century also accumulates in food chains and causes reproductive problems e g eggshell thinning in certain bird species due to the ready homolytic fission of the c cl bond to create chlorine radicals in the upper atmosphere chlorofluorocarbons have been phased out due to the harm they do to the ozone layer occurrence and production chlorine is too reactive to occur as the free element in nature but is very abundant in the form of its chloride salts it is the twenty first most abundant element in earth s crust and makes up parts per million of it through the large deposits of chloride minerals especially sodium chloride that have been evaporated from water bodies all of these pale in comparison to the reserves of chloride ions in seawater smaller amounts at higher concentrations occur in some inland seas and underground brine wells such as the great salt lake in utah and the dead sea in israel small batches of chlorine gas are prepared in the laboratory by combining hydrochloric acid and manganese dioxide but the need rarely arises due to its ready availability in industry elemental chlorine is usually produced by the electrolysis of sodium chloride dissolved in water this method the chloralkali process industrialized in now provides most industrial chlorine gas along with chlorine the method yields hydrogen gas and sodium hydroxide which is the most valuable product the process proceeds according to the following chemical equation nacl h o cl h naohthe electrolysis of chloride solutions all proceed according to the following equations cathode h o e h oh anode cl cl e in diaphragm cell electrolysis an asbestos or polymer fiber diaphragm separates a cathode and an anode preventing the chlorine forming at the anode from re mixing with the sodium hydroxide and the hydrogen formed at the cathode the salt solution brine is continuously fed to the anode compartment and flows through the diaphragm to the cathode compartment where the caustic alkali is produced and the brine is partially depleted diaphragm methods produce dilute and slightly impure alkali but they are not burdened with the problem of mercury disposal and they are more energy efficient membrane cell electrolysis employs permeable membrane as an ion exchanger saturated sodium or potassium chloride solution is passed through the anode compartment leaving at a lower concentration this method also produces very pure sodium or potassium hydroxide but has the disadvantage of requiring very pure brine at high concentrations in the deacon process hydrogen chloride recovered from the production of organochlorine compounds is recovered as chlorine the process relies on oxidation using oxygen hcl o cl h othe reaction requires a catalyst as introduced by deacon early catalysts were based on copper commercial processes such as the mitsui mt chlorine process have switched to chromium and ruthenium based catalysts the chlorine produced is available in cylinders from sizes ranging from g to kg as well as drums kg tank wagons tonnes on roads tonnes by rail and barges tonnes applications sodium chloride is the most common chlorine compound and is the main source of chlorine for the demand by the chemical industry about chlorine containing compounds are commercially traded including such diverse compounds as chlorinated methane ethanes vinyl chloride polyvinyl chloride pvc aluminium trichloride for catalysis the chlorides of magnesium titanium zirconium and hafnium which are the precursors for producing the pure form of those elements quantitatively of all elemental chlorine produced about is used in the manufacture of organic compounds and in the manufacture of inorganic chlorine compounds about chlorine compounds are used commercially the remaining of chlorine produced is used for bleaches and disinfection products the most significant of organic compounds in terms of production volume are dichloroethane and vinyl chloride intermediates in the production of pvc other particularly important organochlorines are methyl chloride methylene chloride chloroform vinylidene chloride trichloroethylene perchloroethylene allyl chloride epichlorohydrin chlorobenzene dichlorobenzenes and trichlorobenzenes the major inorganic compounds include hcl cl o hocl naclo chlorinated isocyanurates alcl sicl sncl pcl pcl pocl ascl sbcl sbcl bicl and zncl sanitation disinfection and antisepsis combating putrefaction in france as elsewhere animal intestines were processed to make musical instrument strings goldbeater s skin and other products this was done in gut factories boyauderies and it was an odiferous and unhealthy process in or about the soci t d encouragement pour l industrie nationale offered a prize for the discovery of a method chemical or mechanical for separating the peritoneal membrane of animal intestines without putrefaction the prize was won by antoine germain labarraque a year old french chemist and pharmacist who had discovered that berthollet s chlorinated bleaching solutions eau de javel not only destroyed the smell of putrefaction of animal tissue decomposition but also actually retarded the decomposition labarraque s research resulted in the use of chlorides and hypochlorites of lime calcium hypochlorite and of sodium sodium hypochlorite in the boyauderies the same chemicals were found to be useful in the routine disinfection and deodorization of latrines sewers markets abattoirs anatomical theatres and morgues they were successful in hospitals lazarets prisons infirmaries both on land and at sea magnaneries stables cattle sheds etc and they were beneficial during exhumations embalming outbreaks of epidemic disease fever and blackleg in cattle disinfection labarraque s chlorinated lime and soda solutions have been advocated since to prevent infection called contagious infection presumed to be transmitted by miasmas and to treat putrefaction of existing wounds including septic wounds in his work labarraque recommended that doctors breathe chlorine wash their hands in chlorinated lime and even sprinkle chlorinated lime about the patients beds in cases of contagious infection in the contagion of infections was well known even though the agency of the microbe was not discovered until more than half a century later during the paris cholera outbreak of large quantities of so called chloride of lime were used to disinfect the capital this was not simply modern calcium chloride but chlorine gas dissolved in lime water dilute calcium hydroxide to form calcium hypochlorite chlorinated lime labarraque s discovery helped to remove the terrible stench of decay from hospitals and dissecting rooms and by doing so effectively deodorised the latin quarter of paris these putrid miasmas were thought by many to cause the spread of contagion and infection both words used before the germ theory of infection chloride of lime was used for destroying odors and putrid matter one source claims chloride of lime was used by dr john snow to disinfect water from the cholera contaminated well that was feeding the broad street pump in london though three other reputable sources that describe that famous cholera epidemic do not mention the incident one reference makes it clear that chloride of lime was used to disinfect the offal and filth in the streets surrounding the broad street pump a common practice in mid nineteenth century england semmelweis and experiments with antisepsis perhaps the most famous application of labarraque s chlorine and chemical base solutions was in when ignaz semmelweis used chlorine water chlorine dissolved in pure water which was cheaper than chlorinated lime solutions to disinfect the hands of austrian doctors which semmelweis noticed still carried the stench of decomposition from the dissection rooms to the patient examination rooms long before the germ theory of disease semmelweis theorized that cadaveric particles were transmitting decay from fresh medical cadavers to living patients and he used the well known labarraque s solutions as the only known method to remove the smell of decay and tissue decomposition which he found that soap did not the solutions proved to be far more effective antiseptics than soap semmelweis was also aware of their greater efficacy but not the reason and this resulted in semmelweis s celebrated success in stopping the transmission of childbed fever puerperal fever in the maternity wards of vienna general hospital in austria in much later during world war i in a standardized and diluted modification of labarraque s solution containing hypochlorite and boric acid as an acidic stabilizer was developed by henry drysdale dakin who gave full credit to labarraque s prior work in this area called dakin s solution the method of wound irrigation with chlorinated solutions allowed antiseptic treatment of a wide variety of open wounds long before the modern antibiotic era a modified version of this solution continues to be employed in wound irrigation in modern times where it remains effective against bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics see century pharmaceuticals public sanitation the first continuous application of chlorination to drinking u s water was installed in jersey city new jersey in by the us department of treasury called for all drinking water to be disinfected with chlorine chlorine is presently an important chemical for water purification such as in water treatment plants in disinfectants and in bleach even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated chlorine is usually used in the form of hypochlorous acid to kill bacteria and other microbes in drinking water supplies and public swimming pools in most private swimming pools chlorine itself is not used but rather sodium hypochlorite formed from chlorine and sodium hydroxide or solid tablets of chlorinated isocyanurates the drawback of using chlorine in swimming pools is that the chlorine reacts with the amino acids in proteins in human hair and skin contrary to popular belief the distinctive chlorine aroma associated with swimming pools is not the result of elemental chlorine itself but of chloramine a chemical compound produced by the reaction of free dissolved chlorine with amines in organic substances including those in urine and sweat as a disinfectant in water chlorine is more than three times as effective against escherichia coli as bromine and more than six times as effective as iodine increasingly monochloramine itself is being directly added to drinking water for purposes of disinfection a process known as chloramination it is often impractical to store and use poisonous chlorine gas for water treatment so alternative methods of adding chlorine are used these include hypochlorite solutions which gradually release chlorine into the water and compounds like sodium dichloro s triazinetrione dihydrate or anhydrous sometimes referred to as dichlor and trichloro s triazinetrione sometimes referred to as trichlor these compounds are stable while solid and may be used in powdered granular or tablet form when added in small amounts to pool water or industrial water systems the chlorine atoms hydrolyze from the rest of the molecule forming hypochlorous acid hocl which acts as a general biocide killing germs microorganisms algae and so on use as a weapon world war i chlorine gas also known as bertholite was first used as a weapon in world war i by germany on april in the second battle of ypres as described by the soldiers it had the distinctive smell of a mixture of pepper and pineapple it also tasted metallic and stung the back of the throat and chest chlorine reacts with water in the mucosa of the lungs to form hydrochloric acid destructive to living tissue and potentially lethal human respiratory systems can be protected from chlorine gas by gas masks with activated charcoal or other filters which makes chlorine gas much less lethal than other chemical weapons it was pioneered by a german scientist later to be a nobel laureate fritz haber of the kaiser wilhelm institute in berlin in collaboration with the german chemical conglomerate ig farben which developed methods for discharging chlorine gas against an entrenched enemy after its first use both sides in the conflict used chlorine as a chemical weapon but it was soon replaced by the more deadly phosgene and mustard gas middle east chlorine gas was also used during the iraq war in anbar province in with insurgents packing truck bombs with mortar shells and chlorine tanks the attacks killed two people from the explosives and sickened more than most of the deaths were caused by the force of the explosions rather than the effects of chlorine since the toxic gas is readily dispersed and diluted in the atmosphere by the blast in some bombings over a hundred civilians were hospitalized due to breathing difficulties the iraqi authorities tightened security for elemental chlorine which is essential for providing safe drinking water to the population on october it was reported that the islamic state of iraq and the levant had used chlorine gas in the town of duluiyah iraq laboratory analysis of clothing and soil samples confirmed the use of chlorine gas against kurdish peshmerga forces in a vehicle borne improvised explosive device attack on january at the highway kiske junction near mosul another country in the middle east syria has used chlorine as a chemical weapon delivered from barrel bombs and rockets in the opcw un joint investigative mechanism concluded that the syrian government used chlorine as a chemical weapon in three separate attacks later investigations from the opcw s investigation and identification team concluded that the syrian air force was responsible for chlorine attacks in and biological role the chloride anion is an essential nutrient for metabolism chlorine is needed for the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach and in cellular pump functions the main dietary source is table salt or sodium chloride overly low or high concentrations of chloride in the blood are examples of electrolyte disturbances hypochloremia having too little chloride rarely occurs in the absence of other abnormalities it is sometimes associated with hypoventilation it can be associated with chronic respiratory acidosis hyperchloremia having too much chloride usually does not produce symptoms when symptoms do occur they tend to resemble those of hypernatremia having too much sodium reduction in blood chloride leads to cerebral dehydration symptoms are most often caused by rapid rehydration which results in cerebral edema hyperchloremia can affect oxygen transport hazards chlorine is a toxic gas that attacks the respiratory system eyes and skin because it is denser than air it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces chlorine gas is a strong oxidizer which may react with flammable materials chlorine is detectable with measuring devices in concentrations as low as parts per million ppm and by smell at ppm coughing and vomiting may occur at ppm and lung damage at ppm about ppm can be fatal after a few deep breaths of the gas the idlh immediately dangerous to life and health concentration is ppm breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system and exposure to the gas can irritate the eyes when chlorine is inhaled at concentrations greater than ppm it reacts with water within the lungs producing hydrochloric acid hcl and hypochlorous acid hclo when used at specified levels for water disinfection the reaction of chlorine with water is not a major concern for human health other materials present in the water may generate disinfection by products that are associated with negative effects on human health in the united states the occupational safety and

Argon,Ar,argon is a chemical element with the symbol ar and atomic number it is in group of the periodic table and is a noble gas argon is the third most abundant gas in earth s atmosphere at ppmv it is more than twice as abundant as water vapor which averages about ppmv but varies greatly times as abundant as carbon dioxide ppmv and more than times as abundant as neon ppmv argon is the most abundant noble gas in earth s crust comprising of the crust nearly all of the argon in earth s atmosphere is radiogenic argon derived from the decay of potassium in earth s crust in the universe argon is by far the most common argon isotope as it is the most easily produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in supernovas the name argon is derived from the greek word neuter singular form of meaning lazy or inactive as a reference to the fact that the element undergoes almost no chemical reactions the complete octet eight electrons in the outer atomic shell makes argon stable and resistant to bonding with other elements its triple point temperature of k is a defining fixed point in the international temperature scale of argon is extracted industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air argon is mostly used as an inert shielding gas in welding and other high temperature industrial processes where ordinarily unreactive substances become reactive for example an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning argon is also used in incandescent fluorescent lighting and other gas discharge tubes argon makes a distinctive blue green gas laser argon is also used in fluorescent glow starters characteristics argon has approximately the same solubility in water as oxygen and is times more soluble in water than nitrogen argon is colorless odorless nonflammable and nontoxic as a solid liquid or gas argon is chemically inert under most conditions and forms no confirmed stable compounds at room temperature although argon is a noble gas it can form some compounds under various extreme conditions argon fluorohydride harf a compound of argon with fluorine and hydrogen that is stable below k c f has been demonstrated although the neutral ground state chemical compounds of argon are presently limited to harf argon can form clathrates with water when atoms of argon are trapped in a lattice of water molecules ions such as arh and excited state complexes such as arf have been demonstrated theoretical calculation predicts several more argon compounds that should be stable but have not yet been synthesized history argon greek neuter singular form of meaning lazy or inactive is named in reference to its chemical inactivity this chemical property of this first noble gas to be discovered impressed the namers an unreactive gas was suspected to be a component of air by henry cavendish in argon was first isolated from air in by lord rayleigh and sir william ramsay at university college london by removing oxygen carbon dioxide water and nitrogen from a sample of clean air they first accomplished this by replicating an experiment of henry cavendish s they trapped a mixture of atmospheric air with additional oxygen in a test tube a upside down over a large quantity of dilute alkali solution b which in cavendish s original experiment was potassium hydroxide and conveyed a current through wires insulated by u shaped glass tubes cc which sealed around the platinum wire electrodes leaving the ends of the wires dd exposed to the gas and insulated from the alkali solution the arc was powered by a battery of five grove cells and a ruhmkorff coil of medium size the alkali absorbed the oxides of nitrogen produced by the arc and also carbon dioxide they operated the arc until no more reduction of volume of the gas could be seen for at least an hour or two and the spectral lines of nitrogen disappeared when the gas was examined the remaining oxygen was reacted with alkaline pyrogallate to leave behind an apparently non reactive gas which they called argon before isolating the gas they had determined that nitrogen produced from chemical compounds was lighter than nitrogen from the atmosphere the difference was slight but it was important enough to attract their attention for many months they concluded that there was another gas in the air mixed in with the nitrogen argon was also encountered in through independent research of h f newall and w n hartley each observed new lines in the emission spectrum of air that did not match known elements until the symbol for argon was a but now it is ar occurrence argon constitutes by volume and by mass of earth s atmosphere air is the primary industrial source of purified argon products argon is isolated from air by fractionation most commonly by cryogenic fractional distillation a process that also produces purified nitrogen oxygen neon krypton and xenon earth s crust and seawater contain ppm and ppm of argon respectively isotopes the main isotopes of argon found on earth are ar ar and ar naturally occurring k with a half life of years decays to stable ar by electron capture or positron emission and also to stable ca by beta decay these properties and ratios are used to determine the age of rocks by k ar dating in earth s atmosphere ar is made by cosmic ray activity primarily by neutron capture of ar followed by two neutron emission in the subsurface environment it is also produced through neutron capture by k followed by proton emission ar is created from the neutron capture by ca followed by an alpha particle emission as a result of subsurface nuclear explosions it has a half life of days between locations in the solar system the isotopic composition of argon varies greatly where the major source of argon is the decay of k in rocks ar will be the dominant isotope as it is on earth argon produced directly by stellar nucleosynthesis is dominated by the alpha process nuclide ar correspondingly solar argon contains ar according to solar wind measurements and the ratio of the three isotopes ar ar ar in the atmospheres of the outer planets is this contrasts with the low abundance of primordial ar in earth s atmosphere which is only ppmv ppmv comparable with that of neon ppmv on earth and with interplanetary gasses measured by probes the atmospheres of mars mercury and titan the largest moon of saturn contain argon predominantly as ar and its content may be as high as mars the predominance of radiogenic ar is the reason the standard atomic weight of terrestrial argon is greater than that of the next element potassium a fact that was puzzling when argon was discovered mendeleev positioned the elements on his periodic table in order of atomic weight but the inertness of argon suggested a placement before the reactive alkali metal henry moseley later solved this problem by showing that the periodic table is actually arranged in order of atomic number see history of the periodic table compounds argon s complete octet of electrons indicates full s and p subshells this full valence shell makes argon very stable and extremely resistant to bonding with other elements before argon and the other noble gases were considered to be chemically inert and unable to form compounds however compounds of the heavier noble gases have since been synthesized the first argon compound with tungsten pentacarbonyl w co ar was isolated in however it was not widely recognised at that time in august another argon compound argon fluorohydride harf was formed by researchers at the university of helsinki by shining ultraviolet light onto frozen argon containing a small amount of hydrogen fluoride with caesium iodide this discovery caused the recognition that argon could form weakly bound compounds even though it was not the first it is stable up to kelvins c the metastable arcf dication which is valence isoelectronic with carbonyl fluoride and phosgene was observed in argon in the form of argon hydride argonium ions has been detected in interstellar medium associated with the crab nebula supernova this was the first noble gas molecule detected in outer space solid argon hydride ar h has the same crystal structure as the mgzn laves phase it forms at pressures between and gpa though raman measurements suggest that the h molecules in ar h dissociate above gpa production industrial argon is extracted industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air in a cryogenic air separation unit a process that separates liquid nitrogen which boils at k from argon which boils at k and liquid oxygen which boils at k about tonnes of argon are produced worldwide every year in radioactive decays ar the most abundant isotope of argon is produced by the decay of k with a half life of years by electron capture or positron emission because of this it is used in potassium argon dating to determine the age of rocks applications argon has several desirable properties argon is a chemically inert gas argon is the cheapest alternative when nitrogen is not sufficiently inert argon has low thermal conductivity argon has electronic properties ionization and or the emission spectrum desirable for some applications other noble gases would be equally suitable for most of these applications but argon is by far the cheapest argon is inexpensive since it occurs naturally in air and is readily obtained as a byproduct of cryogenic air separation in the production of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen the primary constituents of air are used on a large industrial scale the other noble gases except helium are produced this way as well but argon is the most plentiful by far the bulk of argon applications arise simply because it is inert and relatively cheap industrial processes argon is used in some high temperature industrial processes where ordinarily non reactive substances become reactive for example an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning for some of these processes the presence of nitrogen or oxygen gases might cause defects within the material argon is used in some types of arc welding such as gas metal arc welding and gas tungsten arc welding as well as in the processing of titanium and other reactive elements an argon atmosphere is also used for growing crystals of silicon and germanium argon is used in the poultry industry to asphyxiate birds either for mass culling following disease outbreaks or as a means of slaughter more humane than electric stunning argon is denser than air and displaces oxygen close to the ground during inert gas asphyxiation its non reactive nature makes it suitable in a food product and since it replaces oxygen within the dead bird argon also enhances shelf life argon is sometimes used for extinguishing fires where valuable equipment may be damaged by water or foam scientific research liquid argon is used as the target for neutrino experiments and direct dark matter searches the interaction between the hypothetical wimps and an argon nucleus produces scintillation light that is detected by photomultiplier tubes two phase detectors containing argon gas are used to detect the ionized electrons produced during the wimp nucleus scattering as with most other liquefied noble gases argon has a high scintillation light yield about photons kev is transparent to its own scintillation light and is relatively easy to purify compared to xenon argon is cheaper and has a distinct scintillation time profile which allows the separation of electronic recoils from nuclear recoils on the other hand its intrinsic beta ray background is larger due to ar contamination unless one uses argon from underground sources which has much less ar contamination most of the argon in earth s atmosphere was produced by electron capture of long lived k k e ar present in natural potassium within earth the ar activity in the atmosphere is maintained by cosmogenic production through the knockout reaction ar n n ar and similar reactions the half life of ar is only years as a result the underground ar shielded by rock and water has much less ar contamination dark matter detectors currently operating with liquid argon include darkside warp ardm microclean and deap neutrino experiments include icarus and microboone both of which use high purity liquid argon in a time projection chamber for fine grained three dimensional imaging of neutrino interactions at link ping university sweden the inert gas is being utilized in a vacuum chamber in which plasma is introduced to ionize metallic films this process results in a film usable for manufacturing computer processors the new process would eliminate the need for chemical baths and use of expensive dangerous and rare materials preservative argon is used to displace oxygen and moisture containing air in packaging material to extend the shelf lives of the contents argon has the european food additive code e aerial oxidation hydrolysis and other chemical reactions that degrade the products are retarded or prevented entirely high purity chemicals and pharmaceuticals are sometimes packed and sealed in argon in winemaking argon is used in a variety of activities to provide a barrier against oxygen at the liquid surface which can spoil wine by fueling both microbial metabolism as with acetic acid bacteria and standard redox chemistry argon is sometimes used as the propellant in aerosol cans argon is also used as a preservative for such products as varnish polyurethane and paint by displacing air to prepare a container for storage since the american national archives stores important national documents such as the declaration of independence and the constitution within argon filled cases to inhibit their degradation argon is preferable to the helium that had been used in the preceding five decades because helium gas escapes through the intermolecular pores in most containers and must be regularly replaced laboratory equipment argon may be used as the inert gas within schlenk lines and gloveboxes argon is preferred to less expensive nitrogen in cases where nitrogen may react with the reagents or apparatus argon may be used as the carrier gas in gas chromatography and in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry it is the gas of choice for the plasma used in icp spectroscopy argon is preferred for the sputter coating of specimens for scanning electron microscopy argon gas is also commonly used for sputter deposition of thin films as in microelectronics and for wafer cleaning in microfabrication medical use cryosurgery procedures such as cryoablation use liquid argon to destroy tissue such as cancer cells it is used in a procedure called argon enhanced coagulation a form of argon plasma beam electrosurgery the procedure carries a risk of producing gas embolism and has resulted in the death of at least one patient blue argon lasers are used in surgery to weld arteries destroy tumors and correct eye defects argon has also been used experimentally to replace nitrogen in the breathing or decompression mix known as argox to speed the elimination of dissolved nitrogen from the blood lighting incandescent lights are filled with argon to preserve the filaments at high temperature from oxidation it is used for the specific way it ionizes and emits light such as in plasma globes and calorimetry in experimental particle physics gas discharge lamps filled with pure argon provide lilac violet light with argon and some mercury blue light argon is also used for blue and green argon ion lasers miscellaneous uses argon is used for thermal insulation in energy efficient windows argon is also used in technical scuba diving to inflate a dry suit because it is inert and has low thermal conductivity argon is used as a propellant in the development of the variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket vasimr compressed argon gas is allowed to expand to cool the seeker heads of some versions of the aim sidewinder missile and other missiles that use cooled thermal seeker heads the gas is stored at high pressure argon with a half life of years has been used for a number of applications primarily ice core and ground water dating also potassium argon dating and related argon argon dating are used to date sedimentary metamorphic and igneous rocks argon has been used by athletes as a doping agent to simulate hypoxic conditions in the world anti doping agency wada added argon and xenon to the list of prohibited substances and methods although at this time there is no reliable test for abuse safety although argon is non toxic it is more dense than air and therefore considered a dangerous asphyxiant in closed areas it is difficult to detect because it is colorless odorless and tasteless a incident in which a man was asphyxiated after entering an argon filled section of oil pipe under construction in alaska highlights the dangers of argon tank leakage in confined spaces and emphasizes the need for proper use storage and handling ,18
Potassium,K,potassium is the chemical element with the symbol k from neo latin kalium and atomic number potassium is a silvery white metal that is soft enough to be cut with a knife with little force potassium metal reacts rapidly with atmospheric oxygen to form flaky white potassium peroxide in only seconds of exposure it was first isolated from potash the ashes of plants from which its name derives in the periodic table potassium is one of the alkali metals all of which have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell that is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge a cation that combines with anions to form salts potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts elemental potassium reacts vigorously with water generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac colored flame it is found dissolved in sea water which is potassium by weight and occurs in many minerals such as orthoclase a common constituent of granites and other igneous rocks potassium is chemically very similar to sodium the previous element in group of the periodic table they have a similar first ionization energy which allows for each atom to give up its sole outer electron it was suspected in that they were distinct elements that combine with the same anions to make similar salts and this was proven in through using electrolysis naturally occurring potassium is composed of three isotopes of which k is radioactive traces of k are found in all potassium and it is the most common radioisotope in the human body potassium ions are vital for the functioning of all living cells the transfer of potassium ions across nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission potassium deficiency and excess can each result in numerous signs and symptoms including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic abnormalities fresh fruits and vegetables are good dietary sources of potassium the body responds to the influx of dietary potassium which raises serum potassium levels with a shift of potassium from outside to inside cells and an increase in potassium excretion by the kidneys most industrial applications of potassium exploit the high solubility in water of potassium compounds such as potassium soaps heavy crop production rapidly depletes the soil of potassium and this can be remedied with agricultural fertilizers containing potassium accounting for of global potassium chemical production etymology the english name for the element potassium comes from the word potash which refers to an early method of extracting various potassium salts placing in a pot the ash of burnt wood or tree leaves adding water heating and evaporating the solution when humphry davy first isolated the pure element using electrolysis in he named it potassium which he derived from the word potash the symbol k stems from kali itself from the root word alkali which in turn comes from arabic al qalyah plant ashes in the german chemist martin klaproth discovered potash in the minerals leucite and lepidolite and realized that potash was not a product of plant growth but actually contained a new element which he proposed calling kali in humphry davy produced the element via electrolysis in ludwig wilhelm gilbert proposed the name kalium for davy s potassium in the swedish chemist berzelius advocated the name kalium for potassium with the chemical symbol k the english and french speaking countries adopted davy and gay lussac th nard s name potassium whereas the germanic countries adopted gilbert klaproth s name kalium the gold book of the international union of pure and applied chemistry has designated the official chemical symbol as k properties physical potassium is the second least dense metal after lithium it is a soft solid with a low melting point and can be easily cut with a knife freshly cut potassium is silvery in appearance but it begins to tarnish toward gray immediately on exposure to air in a flame test potassium and its compounds emit a lilac color with a peak emission wavelength of nanometers neutral potassium atoms have electrons one more than the configuration of the noble gas argon because of its low first ionization energy of kj mol the potassium atom is much more likely to lose the last electron and acquire a positive charge although negatively charged alkalide k ions are not impossible in contrast the second ionization energy is very high kj mol chemical potassium reacts with oxygen water and carbon dioxide components in air with oxygen it forms potassium peroxide with water potassium forms potassium hydroxide the reaction of potassium with water can be violently exothermic especially since the coproduced hydrogen gas can ignite because of this potassium and the liquid sodium potassium nak alloy are potent desiccants although they are no longer used as such compounds four oxides of potassium are well studied potassium oxide k o potassium peroxide k o potassium superoxide ko and potassium ozonide ko the binary potassium oxygen compounds react with water forming potassium hydroxide koh potassium hydroxide is a strong base illustrating its hydrophilic character as much as kg of koh can dissolve in a single liter of water anhydrous koh is rarely encountered koh reacts readily with carbon dioxide co to produce potassium carbonate k co and in principle could be used to remove traces of the gas from air like the closely related sodium hydroxide potassium hydroxide reacts with fats to produce soaps in general potassium compounds are ionic and owing to the high hydration energy of the k ion have excellent water solubility the main species in water solution are the aquo complexes k h o n where n and potassium heptafluorotantalate k taf is an intermediate in the purification of tantalum from the otherwise persistent contaminant of niobium organopotassium compounds illustrate nonionic compounds of potassium they feature highly polar covalent k c bonds examples include benzyl potassium kch c h potassium intercalates into graphite to give a variety of graphite intercalation compounds including kc isotopes there are known isotopes of potassium three of which occur naturally k k and k by mole fraction naturally occurring k has a half life of years it decays to stable ar by electron capture or positron emission or to stable ca by beta decay the decay of k to ar is the basis of a common method for dating rocks the conventional k ar dating method depends on the assumption that the rocks contained no argon at the time of formation and that all the subsequent radiogenic argon ar was quantitatively retained minerals are dated by measurement of the concentration of potassium and the amount of radiogenic ar that has accumulated the minerals best suited for dating include biotite muscovite metamorphic hornblende and volcanic feldspar whole rock samples from volcanic flows and shallow instrusives can also be dated if they are unaltered apart from dating potassium isotopes have been used as tracers in studies of weathering and for nutrient cycling studies because potassium is a macronutrient required for life on earth k occurs in natural potassium and thus in some commercial salt substitutes in sufficient quantity that large bags of those substitutes can be used as a radioactive source for classroom demonstrations k is the radioisotope with the largest abundance in the body in healthy animals and people k represents the largest source of radioactivity greater even than c in a human body of kg about nuclei of k decay per second the activity of natural potassium is bq g cosmic formation and distribution potassium is formed in supernovae by nucleosynthesis from lighter atoms potassium is principally created in type ii supernovae via an explosive oxygen burning process these are fusion reactions do not confuse with chemical burning between potassium and oxygen k is also formed in s process nucleosynthesis and the neon burning process potassium is the th most abundant element in the solar system and the th most abundant element by weight in the earth it makes up about of the weight of the earth s crust and is the seventh most abundant element in the crust the potassium concentration in seawater is g l wt v about one twenty seventh the concentration of sodium potash potash is primarily a mixture of potassium salts because plants have little or no sodium content and the rest of a plant s major mineral content consists of calcium salts of relatively low solubility in water while potash has been used since ancient times its composition was not understood georg ernst stahl obtained experimental evidence that led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in and henri louis duhamel du monceau was able to prove this difference in the exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium was not known then and thus antoine lavoisier did not include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in for a long time the only significant applications for potash were the production of glass bleach soap and gunpowder as potassium nitrate potassium soaps from animal fats and vegetable oils were especially prized because they tend to be more water soluble and of softer texture and are therefore known as soft soaps the discovery by justus liebig in that potassium is a necessary element for plants and that most types of soil lack potassium caused a steep rise in demand for potassium salts wood ash from fir trees was initially used as a potassium salt source for fertilizer but with the discovery in of mineral deposits containing potassium chloride near sta furt germany the production of potassium containing fertilizers began at an industrial scale other potash deposits were discovered and by the s canada became the dominant producer metal potassium metal was first isolated in by humphry davy who derived it by electrolysis of molten koh with the newly discovered voltaic pile potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis later in the same year davy reported extraction of the metal sodium from a mineral derivative caustic soda naoh or lye rather than a plant salt by a similar technique demonstrating that the elements and thus the salts are different although the production of potassium and sodium metal should have shown that both are elements it took some time before this view was universally accepted because of the sensitivity of potassium to water and air air free techniques are normally employed for handling the element it is unreactive toward nitrogen and saturated hydrocarbons such as mineral oil or kerosene it readily dissolves in liquid ammonia up to g per g of ammonia at c depending on the concentration the ammonia solutions are blue to yellow and their electrical conductivity is similar to that of liquid metals potassium slowly reacts with ammonia to form knh but this reaction is accelerated by minute amounts of transition metal salts because it can reduce the salts to the metal potassium is often used as the reductant in the preparation of finely divided metals from their salts by the rieke method illustrative is the preparation of magnesium mgcl k mg kcl geology elemental potassium does not occur in nature because of its high reactivity it reacts violently with water see section precautions below and also reacts with oxygen orthoclase potassium feldspar is a common rock forming mineral granite for example contains potassium which is well above the average in the earth s crust sylvite kcl carnallite kcl mgcl h o kainite mgso kcl h o and langbeinite mgso k so are the minerals found in large evaporite deposits worldwide the deposits often show layers starting with the least soluble at the bottom and the most soluble on top deposits of niter potassium nitrate are formed by decomposition of organic material in contact with atmosphere mostly in caves because of the good water solubility of niter the formation of larger deposits requires special environmental conditions biological role potassium is the eighth or ninth most common element by mass in the human body so that a kg adult contains a total of about g of potassium the body has about as much potassium as sulfur and chlorine and only calcium and phosphorus are more abundant with the exception of the ubiquitous chon elements potassium ions are present in a wide variety of proteins and enzymes biochemical function potassium levels influence multiple physiological processes including resting cellular membrane potential and the propagation of action potentials in neuronal muscular and cardiac tissue due to the electrostatic and chemical properties k ions are larger than na ions and ion channels and pumps in cell membranes can differentiate between the two ions actively pumping or passively passing one of the two ions while blocking the other hormone secretion and action vascular tone systemic blood pressure control gastrointestinal motility acid base homeostasis glucose and insulin metabolism mineralocorticoid action renal concentrating ability fluid and electrolyte balance homeostasis potassium homeostasis denotes the maintenance of the total body potassium content plasma potassium level and the ratio of the intracellular to extracellular potassium concentrations within narrow limits in the face of pulsatile intake meals obligatory renal excretion and shifts between intracellular and extracellular compartments plasma levels plasma potassium is normally kept at to millimoles mmol or milliequivalents meq per liter by multiple mechanisms levels outside this range are associated with an increasing rate of death from multiple causes and some cardiac kidney and lung diseases progress more rapidly if serum potassium levels are not maintained within the normal range an average meal of mmol presents the body with more potassium than is present in all plasma mmol however this surge causes the plasma potassium to rise only at most as a result of prompt and efficient clearance by both renal and extra renal mechanisms hypokalemia a deficiency of potassium in the plasma can be fatal if severe common causes are increased gastrointestinal loss vomiting diarrhea and increased renal loss diuresis deficiency symptoms include muscle weakness paralytic ileus ecg abnormalities decreased reflex response and in severe cases respiratory paralysis alkalosis and cardiac arrhythmia control mechanisms potassium content in the plasma is tightly controlled by four basic mechanisms which have various names and classifications the four are a reactive negative feedback system a reactive feed forward system a predictive or circadian system and an internal or cell membrane transport system collectively the first three are sometimes termed the external potassium homeostasis system and the first two the reactive potassium homeostasis system the reactive negative feedback system refers to the system that induces renal secretion of potassium in response to a rise in the plasma potassium potassium ingestion shift out of cells or intravenous infusion the reactive feed forward system refers to an incompletely understood system that induces renal potassium secretion in response to potassium ingestion prior to any rise in the plasma potassium this is probably initiated by gut cell potassium receptors that detect ingested potassium and trigger vagal afferent signals to the pituitary gland the predictive or circadian system increases renal secretion of potassium during mealtime hours e g daytime for humans nighttime for rodents independent of the presence amount or absence of potassium ingestion it is mediated by a circadian oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain central clock which causes the kidney peripheral clock to secrete potassium in this rhythmic circadian fashion the ion transport system moves potassium across the cell membrane using two mechanisms one is active and pumps sodium out of and potassium into the cell the other is passive and allows potassium to leak out of the cell potassium and sodium cations influence fluid distribution between intracellular and extracellular compartments by osmotic forces the movement of potassium and sodium through the cell membrane is mediated by the na k atpase pump this ion pump uses atp to pump three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions into the cell creating an electrochemical gradient and electromotive force across the cell membrane the highly selective potassium ion channels which are tetramers are crucial for hyperpolarization inside neurons after an action potential is triggered to cite one example the most recently discovered potassium ion channel is kirbac which makes a total of five potassium ion channels kcsa kirbac kirbac kvap and mthk with a determined structure all five are from prokaryotic species renal filtration reabsorption and excretion renal handling of potassium is closely connected to sodium handling potassium is the major cation positive ion inside animal cells mmol l g while sodium is the major cation of extracellular fluid mmol l g in the kidneys about liters of plasma is filtered through the glomeruli and into the renal tubules per day this filtering involves about g of sodium and g of potassium since only g of sodium and g of potassium are likely to be replaced by diet renal filtering must efficiently reabsorb the remainder from the plasma sodium is reabsorbed to maintain extracellular volume osmotic pressure and serum sodium concentration within narrow limits potassium is reabsorbed to maintain serum potassium concentration within narrow limits sodium pumps in the renal tubules operate to reabsorb sodium potassium must be conserved but because the amount of potassium in the blood plasma is very small and the pool of potassium in the cells is about times as large the situation is not so critical for potassium since potassium is moved passively in counter flow to sodium in response to an apparent but not actual donnan equilibrium the urine can never sink below the concentration of potassium in serum except sometimes by actively excreting water at the end of the processing potassium is excreted twice and reabsorbed three times before the urine reaches the collecting tubules at that point urine usually has about the same potassium concentration as plasma at the end of the processing potassium is secreted one more time if the serum levels are too high with no potassium intake it is excreted at about mg per day until in about a week potassium in the serum declines to a mildly deficient level of mmol l if potassium is still withheld the concentration continues to fall until a severe deficiency causes eventual death the potassium moves passively through pores in the cell membrane when ions move through ion transporters pumps there is a gate in the pumps on both sides of the cell membrane and only one gate can be open at once as a result approximately ions are forced through per second ion channel have only one gate and there only one kind of ion can stream through at million to million ions per second calcium is required to open the pores although calcium may work in reverse by blocking at least one of the pores carbonyl groups inside the pore on the amino acids mimic the water hydration that takes place in water solution by the nature of the electrostatic charges on four carbonyl groups inside the pore nutrition dietary recommendations the u s national academy of medicine nam on behalf of both the u s and canada sets estimated average requirements ears and recommended dietary allowances rdas or adequate intakes ais for when there is not sufficient information to set ears and rdas collectively the ears rdas ais and uls are referred to as dietary reference intakes for both males and females under years of age the ais for potassium are mg of potassium for month old infants mg of potassium for month old infants mg of potassium for year old children and mg of potassium for year old children for males years of age and older the ais for potassium are mg of potassium for year old males mg of potassium for year old males and mg for males that are years of age and older for females years of age and older the ais for potassium are mg of potassium for year old females and mg of potassium for females that are years of age and older for pregnant and lactating females the ais for potassium are mg of potassium for year old pregnant females mg for pregnant females that are years of age and older furthermore mg of potassium for year old lactating females and mg for lactating females that are years of age and older as for safety the nam also sets tolerable upper intake levels uls for vitamins and minerals but for potassium the evidence was insufficient so no ul was established as of most americans adults consume less than mg likewise in the european union in particular in germany and italy insufficient potassium intake is somewhat common the british national health service recommends a similar intake saying that adults need mg per day and that excess amounts may cause health problems such as stomach pain and diarrhea in the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine revised the adequate intake for potassium to mg day for females years of age and older who are not pregnant or lactating and mg day for males years of age and older food sources potassium is present in all fruits vegetables meat and fish foods with high potassium concentrations include yam parsley dried apricots milk chocolate all nuts especially almonds and pistachios potatoes bamboo shoots bananas avocados coconut water soybeans and bran the usda lists tomato paste orange juice beet greens white beans potatoes plantains bananas apricots and many other dietary sources of potassium ranked in descending order according to potassium content a day s worth of potassium is in plantains or bananas deficient intake diets low in potassium can lead to hypertension and hypokalemia supplementation supplements of potassium are most widely used in conjunction with diuretics that block reabsorption of sodium and water upstream from the distal tubule thiazides and loop diuretics because this promotes increased distal tubular potassium secretion with resultant increased potassium excretion a variety of prescription and over the counter supplements are available potassium chloride may be dissolved in water but the salty bitter taste makes liquid supplements unpalatable typical doses range from mmol mg to mmol mg potassium is also available in tablets or capsules which are formulated to allow potassium to leach slowly out of a matrix since very high concentrations of potassium ion that occur adjacent to a solid tablet can injure the gastric or intestinal mucosa for this reason non prescription potassium pills are limited by law in the us to a maximum of mg of potassium a meta analysis concluded that a mg increase in the daily intake of potassium was associated with a lower risk of stroke potassium chloride and potassium bicarbonate may be useful to control mild hypertension in potassium was the rd most commonly prescribed medication in the united states with more than million prescriptions detection by taste buds potassium can be detected by taste because it triggers three of the five types of taste sensations according to concentration dilute solutions of potassium ions taste sweet allowing moderate concentrations in milk and juices while higher concentrations become increasingly bitter alkaline and finally also salty to the taste the combined bitterness and saltiness of high potassium solutions makes high dose potassium supplementation by liquid drinks a palatability challenge commercial production mining potassium salts such as carnallite langbeinite polyhalite and sylvite form extensive evaporite deposits in ancient lake bottoms and seabeds making extraction of potassium salts in these environments commercially viable the principal source of potassium potash is mined in canada russia belarus kazakhstan germany israel united states jordan and other places around the world the first mined deposits were located near sta furt germany but the deposits span from great britain over germany into poland they are located in the zechstein and were deposited in the middle to late permian the largest deposits ever found lie meters feet below the surface of the canadian province of saskatchewan the deposits are located in the elk point group produced in the middle devonian saskatchewan where several large mines have operated since the s pioneered the technique of freezing of wet sands the blairmore formation to drive mine shafts through them the main potash mining company in saskatchewan until its merge was the potash corporation of saskatchewan now nutrien the water of the dead sea is used by israel and jordan as a source of potash while the concentration in normal oceans is too low for commercial production at current prices chemical extraction several methods are used to separate potassium salts from sodium and magnesium compounds the most used method is fractional precipitation using the solubility differences of the salts electrostatic separation of the ground salt mixture is also used in some mines the resulting sodium and magnesium waste is either stored underground or piled up in slag heaps most of the mined potassium mineral ends up as potassium chloride after processing the mineral industry refers to potassium chloride either as potash muriate of potash or simply mop pure potassium metal can be isolated by electrolysis of its hydroxide in a process that has changed little since it was first used by humphry davy in although the electrolysis process was developed and used in industrial scale in the s the thermal method by reacting sodium with potassium

ranges from to of the harvested weight of crops conventionally expressed as amount of k o modern high yield agriculture depends upon fertilizers to replace the potassium lost at harvest most agricultural fertilizers contain potassium chloride while potassium sulfate is used for chloride sensitive crops or crops needing higher sulfur content the sulfate is produced mostly by decomposition

preservative for example in wine and beer making but not in meats it is also used to bleach textiles and straw and in the tanning of leathers industrial major potassium chemicals are potassium hydroxide potassium carbonate potassium sulfate and potassium chloride megatons of these compounds are produced annually potassium hydroxide koh is a strong base which is used in industry to neutralize strong and weak acids to control ph and to manufacture potassium salts it is also used to saponify fats and oils in industrial cleaners and in hydrolysis reactions for example of esters

such as inks dyes wood stains by reacting with the tannic acid in wood explosives fireworks fly paper and safety matches as well as in the tanning of leather all of these uses are due to the chemistry of the chromate ion rather than to that of the potassium ion niche uses there are thousands of uses of various potassium compounds one example is potassium superoxide ko an orange solid that acts as a portable source of oxygen and a carbon dioxide absorber it is widely used in respiration systems in mines submarines and spacecraft as it takes less volume than the gaseous oxygen ko co k co o another example is potassium cobaltinitrite k co no which is used as artist s pigment under the name of aureolin or cobalt yellow the stable isotopes of potassium can be laser cooled and used to probe

stable fermions amongst the alkali metals laboratory uses an alloy of sodium and potassium nak is a liquid used as a heat transfer medium and a desiccant for producing dry and air free solvents it can

precautions potassium metal can react violently with water producing potassium hydroxide koh and hydrogen gas k s h o l koh aq h g this reaction is exothermic and releases sufficient heat to ignite the resulting hydrogen in the presence of oxygen finely powdered potassium ignites in air at room temperature the bulk metal ignites in air if heated because its density is g cm burning potassium floats in water that exposes it to atmospheric oxygen many common fire extinguishing agents including water either are ineffective or make a potassium fire worse nitrogen argon sodium chloride table salt sodium carbonate soda ash and silicon dioxide sand are effective if they are dry some class d dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are also effective these agents deprive the fire of oxygen and cool the potassium metal during storage potassium forms peroxides and superoxides these peroxides may react violently with organic compounds such as oils both peroxides and superoxides may react explosively with metallic potassium because potassium reacts with water vapor in the air it is usually stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene unlike lithium and sodium however potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than six months unless in an inert oxygen free atmosphere or under vacuum after prolonged storage in air dangerous shock sensitive peroxides can form on the metal and under the lid of the container and can detonate upon opening ingestion of large amounts of potassium compounds can lead to hyperkalemia strongly influencing the cardiovascular system potassium chloride is used in the united states for lethal injection executions ,19
Calcium,Ca,calcium is a chemical element with the symbol ca and atomic number as an alkaline earth metal calcium is a reactive metal that forms a dark oxide nitride layer when exposed to air its physical and chemical properties are most similar to its heavier homologues strontium and barium it is the fifth most abundant element in earth s crust and the third most abundant metal after iron and aluminium the most common calcium compound on earth is calcium carbonate found in limestone and the fossilised remnants of early sea life gypsum anhydrite fluorite and apatite are also sources of calcium the name derives from latin calx lime which was obtained from heating limestone some calcium compounds were known to the ancients though their chemistry was unknown until the seventeenth century pure calcium was isolated in via electrolysis of its oxide by humphry davy who named the element calcium compounds are widely used in many industries in foods and pharmaceuticals for calcium supplementation in the paper industry as bleaches as components in cement and electrical insulators and in the manufacture of soaps on the other hand the metal in pure form has few applications due to its high reactivity still in small quantities it is often used as an alloying component in steelmaking and sometimes as a calcium lead alloy in making automotive batteries calcium is the most abundant metal and the fifth most abundant element in the human body as electrolytes calcium ions ca play a vital role in the physiological and biochemical processes of organisms and cells in signal transduction pathways where they act as a second messenger in neurotransmitter release from neurons in contraction of all muscle cell types as cofactors in many enzymes and in fertilization calcium ions outside cells are important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes protein synthesis and bone formation characteristics classification calcium is a very ductile silvery metal sometimes described as pale yellow whose properties are very similar to the heavier elements in its group strontium barium and radium a calcium atom has twenty electrons arranged in the electron configuration ar s like the other elements placed in group of the periodic table calcium has two valence electrons in the outermost s orbital which are very easily lost in chemical reactions to form a dipositive ion with the stable electron configuration of a noble gas in this case argon hence calcium is almost always divalent in its compounds which are usually ionic hypothetical univalent salts of calcium would be stable with respect to their elements but not to disproportionation to the divalent salts and calcium metal because the enthalpy of formation of mx is much higher than those of the hypothetical mx this occurs because of the much greater lattice energy afforded by the more highly charged ca cation compared to the hypothetical ca cation calcium strontium barium and radium are always considered to be alkaline earth metals the lighter beryllium and magnesium also in group of the periodic table are often included as well nevertheless beryllium and magnesium differ significantly from the other members of the group in their physical and chemical behaviour they behave more like aluminium and zinc respectively and have some of the weaker metallic character of the post transition metals which is why the traditional definition of the term alkaline earth metal excludes them physical properties calcium metal melts at c and boils at c these values are higher than those for magnesium and strontium the neighbouring group metals it crystallises in the face centered cubic arrangement like strontium above c it changes to an anisotropic hexagonal close packed arrangement like magnesium its density of g cm is the lowest in its group calcium is harder than lead but can be cut with a knife with effort while calcium is a poorer conductor of electricity than copper or aluminium by volume it is a better conductor by mass than both due to its very low density while calcium is infeasible as a conductor for most terrestrial applications as it reacts quickly with atmospheric oxygen its use as such in space has been considered chemical properties the chemistry of calcium is that of a typical heavy alkaline earth metal for example calcium spontaneously reacts with water more quickly than magnesium and less quickly than strontium to produce calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas it also reacts with the oxygen and nitrogen in the air to form a mixture of calcium oxide and calcium nitride when finely divided it spontaneously burns in air to produce the nitride in bulk calcium is less reactive it quickly forms a hydration coating in moist air but below relative humidity it may be stored indefinitely at room temperature besides the simple oxide cao the peroxide cao can be made by direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide ca o calcium hydroxide ca oh is a strong base though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of strontium barium or the alkali metals all four dihalides of calcium are known calcium carbonate caco and calcium sulfate caso are particularly abundant minerals like strontium and barium as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution due to the large size of the calcium ion ca high coordination numbers are common up to in some intermetallic compounds such as cazn calcium is readily complexed by oxygen chelates such as edta and polyphosphates which are useful in analytic chemistry and removing calcium ions from hard water in the absence of steric hindrance smaller group cations tend to form stronger complexes but when large polydentate macrocycles are involved the trend is reversed although calcium is in the same group as magnesium and organomagnesium compounds are very commonly used throughout chemistry organocalcium compounds are not similarly widespread because they are more difficult to make and more reactive although they have recently been investigated as possible catalysts organocalcium compounds tend to be more similar to organoytterbium compounds due to the similar ionic radii of yb pm and ca pm most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures bulky ligands tend to favor stability for example calcium dicyclopentadienyl ca c h must be made by directly reacting calcium metal with mercurocene or cyclopentadiene itself replacing the c h ligand with the bulkier c ch ligand on the other hand increases the compound s solubility volatility and kinetic stability isotopes natural calcium is a mixture of five stable isotopes ca ca ca ca and ca and one isotope with a half life so long that it can be considered stable for all practical purposes ca with a half life of about years calcium is the first lightest element to have six naturally occurring isotopes by far the most common isotope of calcium in nature is ca which makes up of all natural calcium it is produced in the silicon burning process from fusion of alpha particles and is the heaviest stable nuclide with equal proton and neutron numbers its occurrence is also supplemented slowly by the decay of primordial k adding another alpha particle leads to unstable ti which quickly decays via two successive electron captures to stable ca this makes up of all natural calcium and is the second most common isotope the other four natural isotopes ca ca ca and ca are significantly rarer each comprising less than of all natural calcium the four lighter isotopes are mainly products of the oxygen burning and silicon burning processes leaving the two heavier ones to be produced via neutron capture processes ca is mostly produced in a hot s process as its formation requires a rather high neutron flux to allow short lived ca to capture a neutron ca is produced by electron capture in the r process in type ia supernovae where high neutron excess and low enough entropy ensures its survival ca and ca are the first classically stable nuclides with a six neutron or eight neutron excess respectively although extremely neutron rich for such a light element ca is very stable because it is a doubly magic nucleus having protons and neutrons arranged in closed shells its beta decay to sc is very hindered because of the gross mismatch of nuclear spin ca has zero nuclear spin being even even while sc has spin so the decay is forbidden by the conservation of angular momentum while two excited states of sc are available for decay as well they are also forbidden due to their high spins as a result when ca does decay it does so by double beta decay to ti instead being the lightest nuclide known to undergo double beta decay the heavy isotope ca can also theoretically undergo double beta decay to ti as well but this has never been observed the lightest and most common isotope ca is also doubly magic and could undergo double electron capture to ar but this has likewise never been observed calcium is the only element to have two primordial doubly magic isotopes the experimental lower limits for the half lives of ca and ca are years and years respectively apart from the practically stable ca the longest lived radioisotope of calcium is ca it decays by electron capture to stable k with a half life of about a hundred thousand years its existence in the early solar system as an extinct radionuclide has been inferred from excesses of k traces of ca also still exist today as it is a cosmogenic nuclide continuously reformed through neutron activation of natural ca many other calcium radioisotopes are known ranging from ca to ca they are all much shorter lived than ca the most stable among them being ca half life days and ca half life days the isotopes lighter than ca usually undergo beta plus decay to isotopes of potassium and those heavier than ca usually undergo beta minus decay to isotopes of scandium although near the nuclear drip lines proton emission and neutron emission begin to be significant decay modes as well like other elements a variety of processes alter the relative abundance of calcium isotopes the best studied of these processes is the mass dependent fractionation of calcium isotopes that accompanies the precipitation of calcium minerals such as calcite aragonite and apatite from solution lighter isotopes are preferentially incorporated into these minerals leaving the surrounding solution enriched in heavier isotopes at a magnitude of roughly per atomic mass unit amu at room temperature mass dependent differences in calcium isotope composition are conventionally expressed by the ratio of two isotopes usually ca ca in a sample compared to the same ratio in a standard reference material ca ca varies by about among common earth materials history calcium compounds were known for millennia although their chemical makeup was not understood until the th century lime as a building material and as plaster for statues was used as far back as around bc the first dated lime kiln dates back to bc and was found in khafajah mesopotamia at about the same time dehydrated gypsum caso h o was being used in the great pyramid of giza this material would later be used for the plaster in the tomb of tutankhamun the ancient romans instead used lime mortars made by heating limestone caco the name calcium itself derives from the latin word calx lime vitruvius noted that the lime that resulted was lighter than the original limestone attributing this to the boiling of the water in joseph black proved that this was due to the loss of carbon dioxide which as a gas had not been recognised by the ancient romans in antoine lavoisier suspected that lime might be an oxide of a fundamental chemical element in his table of the elements lavoisier listed five salifiable earths i e ores that could be made to react with acids to produce salts salis salt in latin chaux calcium oxide magn sie magnesia magnesium oxide baryte barium sulfate alumine alumina aluminium oxide and silice silica silicon dioxide about these elements lavoisier reasoned we are probably only acquainted as yet with a part of the metallic substances existing in nature as all those which have a stronger affinity to oxygen than carbon possesses are incapable hitherto of being reduced to a metallic state and consequently being only presented to our observation under the form of oxyds are confounded with earths it is extremely probable that barytes which we have just now arranged with earths is in this situation for in many experiments it exhibits properties nearly approaching to those of metallic bodies it is even possible that all the substances we call earths may be only metallic oxyds irreducible by any hitherto known process calcium along with its congeners magnesium strontium and barium was first isolated by humphry davy in following the work of j ns jakob berzelius and magnus martin af pontin on electrolysis davy isolated calcium and magnesium by putting a mixture of the respective metal oxides with mercury ii oxide on a platinum plate which was used as the anode the cathode being a platinum wire partially submerged into mercury electrolysis then gave calcium mercury and magnesium mercury amalgams and distilling off the mercury gave the metal however pure calcium cannot be prepared in bulk by this method and a workable commercial process for its production was not found until over a century later occurrence and production at calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the earth s crust and the third most abundant metal behind aluminium and iron it is also the fourth most abundant element in the lunar highlands sedimentary calcium carbonate deposits pervade the earth s surface as fossilized remains of past marine life they occur in two forms the rhombohedral calcite more common and the orthorhombic aragonite forming in more temperate seas minerals of the first type include limestone dolomite marble chalk and iceland spar aragonite beds make up the bahamas the florida keys and the red sea basins corals sea shells and pearls are mostly made up of calcium carbonate among the other important minerals of calcium are gypsum caso h o anhydrite caso fluorite caf and apatite ca po f the major producers of calcium are china about to tonnes per year russia about to tonnes per year and the united states about to tonnes per year canada and france are also among the minor producers in about tonnes of calcium were produced about half of the world s extracted calcium is used by the united states with about of the output used each year in russia and china davy s method of electrolysis is still used but is instead applied to molten calcium chloride since calcium is less reactive than strontium or barium the oxide nitride coating that results in air is stable and lathe machining and other standard metallurgical techniques are suitable for calcium in the united states and canada calcium is instead produced by reducing lime with aluminium at high temperatures geochemical cycling calcium cycling provides a link between tectonics climate and the carbon cycle in the simplest terms uplift of mountains exposes calcium bearing rocks such as some granites to chemical weathering and releases ca into surface water these ions are transported to the ocean where they react with dissolved co to form limestone caco which in turn settles to the sea floor where it is incorporated into new rocks dissolved co along with carbonate and bicarbonate ions are termed dissolved inorganic carbon dic the actual reaction is more complicated and involves the bicarbonate ion hco that forms when co reacts with water at seawater ph ca hco caco s co h oat seawater ph most of the co is immediately converted back into hco the reaction results in a net transport of one molecule of co from the ocean atmosphere into the lithosphere the result is that each ca ion released by chemical weathering ultimately removes one co molecule from the surficial system atmosphere ocean soils and living organisms storing it in carbonate rocks where it is likely to stay for hundreds of millions of years the weathering of calcium from rocks thus scrubs co from the ocean and atmosphere exerting a strong long term effect on climate uses the largest use of metallic calcium is in steelmaking due to its strong chemical affinity for oxygen and sulfur its oxides and sulfides once formed give liquid lime aluminate and sulfide inclusions in steel which float out on treatment these inclusions disperse throughout the steel and become small and spherical improving castability cleanliness and general mechanical properties calcium is also used in maintenance free automotive batteries in which the use of calcium lead alloys instead of the usual antimony lead alloys leads to lower water loss and lower self discharging due to the risk of expansion and cracking aluminium is sometimes also incorporated into these alloys these lead calcium alloys are also used in casting replacing lead antimony alloys calcium is also used to strengthen aluminium alloys used for bearings for the control of graphitic carbon in cast iron and to remove bismuth impurities from lead calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners where it functions to generate heat and calcium hydroxide that saponifies the fats and liquefies the proteins for example those in hair that block drains besides metallurgy the reactivity of calcium is exploited to remove nitrogen from high purity argon gas and as a getter for oxygen and nitrogen it is also used as a reducing agent in the production of chromium zirconium thorium and uranium it can also be used to store hydrogen gas as it reacts with hydrogen to form solid calcium hydride from which the hydrogen can easily be re extracted calcium isotope fractionation during mineral formation has led to several applications of calcium isotopes in particular the observation by skulan and depaolo that calcium minerals are isotopically lighter than the solutions from which the minerals precipitate is the basis of analogous applications in medicine and in paleoceanography in animals with skeletons mineralized with calcium the calcium isotopic composition of soft tissues reflects the relative rate of formation and dissolution of skeletal mineral in humans changes in the calcium isotopic composition of urine have been shown to be related to changes in bone mineral balance when the rate of bone formation exceeds the rate of bone resorption the ca ca ratio in soft tissue rises and vice versa because of this relationship calcium isotopic measurements of urine or blood may be useful in the early detection of metabolic bone diseases like osteoporosis a similar system exists in seawater where ca ca tends to rise when the rate of removal of ca by mineral precipitation exceeds the input of new calcium into the ocean in skulan and depaolo presented the first evidence of change in seawater ca ca over geologic time along with a theoretical explanation of these changes more recent papers have confirmed this observation demonstrating that seawater ca concentration is not constant and that the ocean is never in a steady state with respect to calcium input and output this has important climatological implications as the marine calcium cycle is closely tied to the carbon cycle many calcium compounds are used in food as pharmaceuticals and in medicine among others for example calcium and phosphorus are supplemented in foods through the addition of calcium lactate calcium diphosphate and tricalcium phosphate the last is also used as a polishing agent in toothpaste and in antacids calcium lactobionate is a white powder that is used as a suspending agent for pharmaceuticals in baking calcium phosphate is used as a leavening agent calcium sulfite is used as a bleach in papermaking and as a disinfectant calcium silicate is used as a reinforcing agent in rubber and calcium acetate is a component of liming rosin and is used to make metallic soaps and synthetic resins calcium is on the world health organization s list of essential medicines food sources foods rich in calcium include dairy products such as yogurt and cheese sardines salmon soy products kale and fortified breakfast cereals because of concerns for long term adverse side effects including calcification of arteries and kidney stones both the u s institute of medicine iom and the european food safety authority efsa set tolerable upper intake levels uls for combined dietary and supplemental calcium from the iom people of ages years are not to exceed g day combined intake for ages not to exceed g day for ages and older not to exceed g day efsa set the ul for all adults at g day but decided the information for children and adolescents was not sufficient to determine uls biological and pathological role function calcium is an essential element needed in large quantities the ca ion acts as an electrolyte and is vital to the health of the muscular circulatory and digestive systems is indispensable to the building of bone and supports synthesis and function of blood cells for example it regulates the contraction of muscles nerve conduction and the clotting of blood as a result intra and extracellular calcium levels are tightly regulated by the body calcium can play this role because the ca ion forms stable coordination complexes with many organic compounds especially proteins it also forms compounds with a wide range of solubilities enabling the formation of the skeleton binding calcium ions may be complexed by proteins through binding the carboxyl groups of glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues through interacting with phosphorylated serine tyrosine or threonine residues or by being chelated by carboxylated amino acid residues trypsin a digestive enzyme uses the first method osteocalcin a bone matrix protein uses the third some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both the first and the second direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium binding enzymes calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface solubility as an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of mm and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix is tricalcium phosphate at m nutrition calcium is a common constituent of multivitamin dietary supplements but the composition of calcium complexes in supplements may affect its bioavailability which varies by solubility of the salt involved calcium citrate malate and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is less other calcium preparations include calcium carbonate calcium citrate malate and calcium gluconate the intestine absorbs about one third of calcium eaten as the free ion and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys hormonal regulation of bone formation and serum levels parathyroid hormone and vitamin d promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions there allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or mineral content when plasma calcium levels fall cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney gut and bone cells with the bone forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by calcitonin whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels abnormal serum levels excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcemia however because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone pth or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin d both of which facilitate calcium absorption all these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart blood vessels or kidneys symptoms include anorexia nausea vomiting memory loss confusion muscle weakness increased urination dehydration and metabolic bone disease chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences for example calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis conversely inadequate calcium or vitamin d intakes may result in hypocalcemia often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective pth receptors in cells symptoms include neuromuscular excitability which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue bone disease as calcium is required for bone development many bone diseases can be traced to the organic matrix or the hydroxyapatite in molecular structure or organization of bone osteoporosis is a reduction in mineral content of bone per unit volume and can be treated by supplementation of calcium vitamin d and bisphosphonates inadequate amounts of calcium vitamin d or phosphates can lead to softening of bones called osteomalacia safety metallic calcium because calcium reacts exothermically with water and acids calcium metal coming into contact with bodily moisture results in severe corrosive irritation when swallowed calcium metal has the same effect on the mouth oesophagus and stomach and can be fatal however long term exposure is not known to have distinct adverse effects ,20
Scandium,Sc,scandium is a chemical element with the symbol sc and atomic number it is a silvery white metallic d block element historically it has been classified as a rare earth element together with yttrium and the lanthanides it was discovered in by spectral analysis of the minerals euxenite and gadolinite from scandinavia scandium is present in most of the deposits of rare earth and uranium compounds but it is extracted from these ores in only a few mines worldwide because of the low availability and difficulties in the preparation of metallic scandium which was first done in applications for scandium were not developed until the s when the positive effects of scandium on aluminium alloys were discovered and its use in such alloys remains its only major application the global trade of scandium oxide is tonnes per year the properties of scandium compounds are intermediate between those of aluminium and yttrium a diagonal relationship exists between the behavior of magnesium and scandium just as there is between beryllium and aluminium in the chemical compounds of the elements in group the predominant oxidation state is properties chemical characteristics scandium is a soft metal with a silvery appearance it develops a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when oxidized by air it is susceptible to weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute acids it does not react with a mixture of nitric acid hno and hydrofluoric acid hf possibly due to the formation of an impermeable passive layer scandium turnings ignite in the air with a brilliant yellow flame to form scandium oxide isotopes in nature scandium is found exclusively as the isotope sc which has a nuclear spin of this is its only stable isotope twenty five radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being sc which has a half life of days sc days the positron emitter sc hours and sc hours all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives less than hours and the majority of these have half lives less than minutes this element also has five nuclear isomers with the most stable being m sc t h the known isotopes of scandium range from sc to sc the primary decay mode at masses lower than the only stable isotope sc is electron capture and the primary mode at masses above it is beta emission the primary decay products at atomic weights below sc are calcium isotopes and the primary products from higher atomic weights are titanium isotopes occurrence in earth s crust scandium is not rare estimates vary from to ppm which is comparable to the abundance of cobalt ppm scandium is only the th most common element on earth th most abundant in the crust but it is the rd most common element in the sun however scandium is distributed sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals rare minerals from scandinavia and madagascar such as thortveitite euxenite and gadolinite are the only known concentrated sources of this element thortveitite can contain up to of scandium in the form of scandium oxide the stable form of scandium is created in supernovas via the r process also scandium is created by cosmic ray spallation of the more abundant iron nuclei si n sc r process fe p sc c n cosmic ray spallation production the world production of scandium is in the order of tonnes per year in the form of scandium oxide the demand is about higher and both the production and demand keep increasing in only three mines produced scandium the uranium and iron mines in zhovti vody in ukraine the rare earth mines in bayan obo china and the apatite mines in the kola peninsula russia since then many other countries have built scandium producing facilities including tonnes year tonnes year sc o by nickel asia corporation and sumitomo metal mining in the philippines in the united states niocorp development hopes to raise billion toward opening a niobium mine at its elk creek site in southeast nebraska which may be able to produce as much as tonnes of scandium oxide annually in each case scandium is a byproduct of the extraction of other elements and is sold as scandium oxide to produce metallic scandium the oxide is converted to scandium fluoride and then reduced with metallic calcium madagascar and the iveland evje region in norway have the only deposits of minerals with high scandium content thortveitite sc y si o but these are not being exploited the mineral kolbeckite scpo h o has a very high scandium content but is not available in any larger deposits the absence of reliable secure stable long term production has limited the commercial applications of scandium despite this low level of use scandium offers significant benefits particularly promising is the strengthening of aluminium alloys with as little as scandium scandium stabilized zirconia enjoys a growing market demand for use as a high efficiency electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells the usgs reports that from to in the us the price of small quantities of scandium ingot has been to per gram and that of scandium oxide to per gram compounds scandium chemistry is almost completely dominated by the trivalent ion sc the radii of m ions in the table below indicate that the chemical properties of scandium ions have more in common with yttrium ions than with aluminium ions in part because of this similarity scandium is often classified as a lanthanide like element oxides and hydroxides the oxide sc o and the hydroxide sc oh are amphoteric sc oh oh sc oh scandate ion sc oh h h o sc h o and scooh are isostructural with their aluminium hydroxide oxide counterparts solutions of sc in water are acidic due to hydrolysis halides and pseudohalides the halides scx where x cl br or i are very soluble in water but scf is insoluble in all four halides the scandium is coordinated the halides are lewis acids for example scf dissolves in a solution containing excess fluoride ion to form scf the coordination number is typical for sc iii in the larger y and la ions coordination numbers of and are common scandium triflate is sometimes used as a lewis acid catalyst in organic chemistry organic derivatives scandium forms a series of organometallic compounds with cyclopentadienyl ligands cp similar to the behavior of the lanthanides one example is the chlorine bridged dimer sccp cl and related derivatives of pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligands uncommon oxidation states compounds that feature scandium in oxidation states other than are rare but well characterized the blue black compound cssccl is one of the simplest this material adopts a sheet like structure that exhibits extensive bonding between the scandium ii centers scandium hydride is not well understood although it appears not to be a saline hydride of sc ii as is observed for most elements a diatomic scandium hydride has been observed spectroscopically at high temperatures in the gas phase scandium borides and carbides are non stoichiometric as is typical for neighboring elements lower oxidation states have also been observed in organoscandium compounds history dmitri mendeleev who is referred to as the father of the periodic table predicted the existence of an element ekaboron with an atomic mass between and in lars fredrik nilson and his team detected this element in the minerals euxenite and gadolinite in nilson prepared grams of scandium oxide of high purity he named the element scandium from the latin scandia meaning scandinavia nilson was apparently unaware of mendeleev s prediction but per teodor cleve recognized the correspondence and notified mendeleev metallic scandium was produced for the first time in by electrolysis of a eutectic mixture of potassium lithium and scandium chlorides at c the first pound of pure scandium metal was produced in production of aluminium alloys began in following a us patent aluminium scandium alloys were also developed in the ussr laser crystals of gadolinium scandium gallium garnet gsgg were used in strategic defense applications developed for the strategic defense initiative sdi in the s and s red giant stars near the galactic center in early evidence was gathered from spectrometer data of significant scandium vanadium and yttrium abundances in red giant stars in the nuclear star cluster nsc in the galactic center further research showed that this was an illusion caused by the relatively low temperature below k of these stars masking the abundance signals and that this phenomenon was observable in other red giants applications the addition of scandium to aluminium limits the grain growth in the heat zone of welded aluminium components this has two beneficial effects the precipitated al sc forms smaller crystals than in other aluminium alloys and the volume of precipitate free zones at the grain boundaries of age hardening aluminium alloys is reduced the al sc precipitate is a coherent precipitate that strengthens the aluminum matrix by applying elastic strain fields that inhibit dislocation movement i e plastic deformation al sc has an equilibrium l superlattice structure exclusive to this system a fine dispersion of nano scale precipitate can be achieved via heat treatment that can also strengthen the alloys through order hardening recent developments include the additions of transition metals such as zr and rare earth metals like er produce shells surrounding the spherical al sc precipitate that reduce coarsening these shells are dictated by the diffusivity of the alloying element and lower the cost of the alloy due to less sc being substituted in part by zr while maintaining stability and less sc being needed to form the precipitate these have made al sc somewhat competitive with titanium alloys along with a wide array of applications however titanium alloys which are similar in lightness and strength are cheaper and much more widely used the alloy al li mg sc ti is as strong as titanium light as aluminium and hard as some ceramics the main application of scandium by weight is in aluminium scandium alloys for minor aerospace industry components these alloys contain between and of scandium they were used in russian military aircraft specifically the mikoyan gurevich mig and mig some items of sports equipment which rely on lightweight high performance materials have been made with scandium aluminium alloys including baseball bats tent poles and bicycle frames and components lacrosse sticks are also made with scandium the american firearm manufacturing company smith wesson produces semi automatic pistols and revolvers with frames of scandium alloy and cylinders of titanium or carbon steel dentists use erbium chromium doped yttrium scandium gallium garnet er cr ysgg lasers for cavity preparation and in endodontics the first scandium based metal halide lamps were patented by general electric and made in north america although they are now produced in all major industrialized countries approximately kg of scandium as sc o is used annually in the united states for high intensity discharge lamps one type of metal halide lamp similar to the mercury vapor lamp is made from scandium triiodide and sodium iodide this lamp is a white light source with high color rendering index that sufficiently resembles sunlight to allow good color reproduction with tv

scandium chloride for rats have been determined as mg kg for intraperitoneal and g kg for oral administration in the light of these results compounds of scandium should be handled as compounds of moderate toxicity scandium appears to be handled by the body in a manner similar to gallium with similar hazards involving its poorly soluble hydroxide ,21
Titanium,Ti,titanium is a chemical element with the symbol ti and atomic number found in nature only as an oxide it can be reduced to produce a lustrous transition metal with a silver color low density and high strength resistant to corrosion in sea water aqua regia and chlorine titanium was discovered in cornwall great britain by william gregor in and was named by martin heinrich klaproth after the titans of greek mythology the element occurs within a number of minerals principally rutile and ilmenite which are widely distributed in the earth s crust and lithosphere it is found in almost all living things as well as bodies of water rocks and soils the metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the kroll and hunter processes the most common compound titanium dioxide is a popular photocatalyst and is used in the manufacture of white pigments other compounds include titanium tetrachloride ticl a component of smoke screens and catalysts and titanium trichloride ticl which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene titanium can be alloyed with iron aluminium vanadium and molybdenum among other elements to produce strong lightweight alloys for aerospace jet engines missiles and spacecraft military industrial processes chemicals and petrochemicals desalination plants pulp and paper automotive agriculture farming medical prostheses orthopedic implants dental and endodontic instruments and files dental implants sporting goods jewelry mobile phones and other applications the two most useful properties of the metal are corrosion resistance and strength to density ratio the highest of any metallic element in its unalloyed condition titanium is as strong as some steels but less dense there are two allotropic forms and five naturally occurring isotopes of this element ti through ti with ti being the most abundant characteristics physical properties as a metal titanium is recognized for its high strength to weight ratio it is a strong metal with low density that is quite ductile especially in an oxygen free environment lustrous and metallic white in color the relatively high melting point c or f makes it useful as a refractory metal it is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity compared to other metals titanium is superconducting when cooled below its critical temperature of k commercially pure pure grades of titanium have ultimate tensile strength of about mpa psi equal to that of common low grade steel alloys but are less dense titanium is denser than aluminium but more than twice as strong as the most commonly used t aluminium alloy certain titanium alloys e g beta c achieve tensile strengths of over mpa psi however titanium loses strength when heated above c f titanium is not as hard as some grades of heat treated steel it is non magnetic and a poor conductor of heat and electricity machining requires precautions because the material can gall unless sharp tools and proper cooling methods are used like steel structures those made from titanium have a fatigue limit that guarantees longevity in some applications the metal is a dimorphic allotrope of an hexagonal form that changes into a body centered cubic lattice form at c f the specific heat of the form increases dramatically as it is heated to this transition temperature but then falls and remains fairly constant for the form regardless of temperature chemical properties like aluminium and magnesium the surface of titanium metal and its alloys oxidize immediately upon exposure to air to form a thin non porous passivation layer that protects the bulk metal from further oxidation or corrosion when it first forms this protective layer is only nm thick but it continues to grow slowly reaching a thickness of nm in four years this layer gives titanium excellent resistance to corrosion almost equivalent to platinum titanium is capable of withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric and hydrochloric acids chloride solutions and most organic acids however titanium is corroded by concentrated acids as indicated by its negative redox potential titanium is a very reactive metal that burns in normal air at lower temperatures than the melting point melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or vacuum at c f it combines with chlorine it also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen titanium readily reacts with oxygen at c f in air and at c f in pure oxygen forming titanium dioxide titanium is one of the few elements that burns in pure nitrogen gas reacting at c f to form titanium nitride which causes embrittlement because of its high reactivity with oxygen nitrogen and many other gases titanium that is evaporated from filaments is the basis for titanium sublimation pumps in which titanium serves as a scavenger for these gases by chemically binding to them such pumps inexpensively produce extremely low pressures in ultra high vacuum systems occurrence titanium is the ninth most abundant element in earth s crust by mass and the seventh most abundant metal it is present as oxides in most igneous rocks in sediments derived from them in living things and natural bodies of water of the types of igneous rocks analyzed by the united states geological survey contained titanium its proportion in soils is approximately to common titanium containing minerals are anatase brookite ilmenite perovskite rutile and titanite sphene akaogiite is an extremely rare mineral consisting of titanium dioxide of these minerals only rutile and ilmenite have economic importance yet even they are difficult to find in high concentrations about and million tonnes of those minerals were mined in respectively significant titanium bearing ilmenite deposits exist in australia canada china india mozambique new zealand norway sierra leone south africa and ukraine about tonnes of titanium metal sponge were produced in mostly in china t japan t russia t and kazakhstan t total reserves of anatase ilmenite and rutile are estimated to exceed billion tonnes the concentration of titanium is about picomolar in the ocean at c the concentration of titanium in water is estimated to be less than m at ph the identity of titanium species in aqueous solution remains unknown because of its low solubility and the lack of sensitive spectroscopic methods although only the oxidation state is stable in air no evidence exists for a biological role although rare organisms are known to accumulate high concentrations of titanium titanium is contained in meteorites and it has been detected in the sun and in m type stars the coolest type with a surface temperature of c f rocks brought back from the moon during the apollo mission are composed of tio native titanium pure metallic is very rare isotopes naturally occurring titanium is composed of five stable isotopes ti ti ti ti and ti with ti being the most abundant natural abundance at least radioisotopes have been characterized the most stable of which are ti with a half life of years ti minutes ti minutes and ti minutes all other radioactive isotopes have half lives less than seconds with the majority less than half a second the isotopes of titanium range in atomic weight from u ti to u ti the primary decay mode for isotopes lighter than ti is positron emission with the exception of ti which undergoes electron capture leading to isotopes of scandium and the primary mode for isotopes heavier than ti is beta emission leading to isotopes of vanadium titanium becomes radioactive upon bombardment with deuterons emitting mainly positrons and hard gamma rays compounds the oxidation state dominates titanium chemistry but compounds in the oxidation state are also numerous commonly titanium adopts an octahedral coordination geometry in its complexes but tetrahedral ticl is a notable exception because of its high oxidation state titanium iv compounds exhibit a high degree of covalent bonding oxides sulfides and alkoxides the most important oxide is tio which exists in three important polymorphs anatase brookite and rutile all three are white diamagnetic solids although mineral samples can appear dark see rutile they adopt polymeric structures in which ti is surrounded by six oxide ligands that link to other ti centers the term titanates usually refers to titanium iv compounds as represented by barium titanate batio with a perovskite structure this material exhibits piezoelectric properties and is used as a transducer in the interconversion of sound and electricity many minerals are titanates such as ilmenite fetio star sapphires and rubies get their asterism star forming shine from the presence of titanium dioxide impurities a variety of reduced oxides suboxides of titanium are known mainly reduced stoichiometries of titanium dioxide obtained by atmospheric plasma spraying ti o described as a ti iv ti iii species is a purple semiconductor produced by reduction of tio with hydrogen at high temperatures and is used industrially when surfaces need to be vapor coated with titanium dioxide it evaporates as pure tio whereas tio evaporates as a mixture of oxides and deposits coatings with variable refractive index also known is ti o with the corundum structure and tio with the rock salt structure although often nonstoichiometric the alkoxides of titanium iv prepared by treating ticl with alcohols are colorless compounds that convert to the dioxide on reaction with water they are industrially useful for depositing solid tio via the sol gel process titanium isopropoxide is used in the synthesis of chiral organic compounds via the sharpless epoxidation titanium forms a variety of sulfides but only tis has attracted significant interest it adopts a layered structure and was used as a cathode in the development of lithium batteries because ti iv is a hard cation the sulfides of titanium are unstable and tend to hydrolyze to the oxide with release of hydrogen sulfide nitrides and carbides titanium nitride tin is a refractory solid exhibiting extreme hardness thermal electrical conductivity and a high melting point tin has a hardness equivalent to sapphire and carborundum on the mohs scale and is often used to coat cutting tools such as drill bits it is also used as a gold colored decorative finish and as a barrier layer in semiconductor fabrication titanium carbide tic which is also very hard is found in cutting tools and coatings halides titanium tetrachloride titanium iv chloride ticl is a colorless volatile liquid commercial samples are yellowish that in air hydrolyzes with spectacular emission of white clouds via the kroll process ticl is used in the conversion of titanium ores to titanium metal titanium tetrachloride is also used to make titanium dioxide e g for use in white paint it is widely used in organic chemistry as a lewis acid for example in the mukaiyama aldol condensation in the van arkel de boer process titanium tetraiodide tii is generated in the production of high purity titanium metal titanium iii and titanium ii also form stable chlorides a notable example is titanium iii chloride ticl which is used as a catalyst for production of polyolefins see ziegler natta catalyst and a reducing agent in organic chemistry organometallic complexes owing to the important role of titanium compounds as polymerization catalyst compounds with ti c bonds have been intensively studied the most common organotitanium complex is titanocene dichloride c h ticl related compounds include tebbe s reagent and petasis reagent titanium forms carbonyl complexes e g c h ti co anticancer therapy studies following the success of platinum based chemotherapy titanium iv complexes were among the first non platinum compounds to be tested for cancer treatment the advantage of titanium compounds lies in their high efficacy and low toxicity in vivo in biological environments hydrolysis leads to the safe and inert titanium dioxide despite these advantages the first candidate compounds failed clinical trials due to insufficient efficacy to toxicity ratios and formulation complications further development resulted in the creation of potentially effective selective and stable titanium based drugs history titanium was discovered in by the clergyman and geologist william gregor as an inclusion of a mineral in cornwall great britain gregor recognized the presence of a new element in ilmenite when he found black sand by a stream and noticed the sand was attracted by a magnet analyzing the sand he determined the presence of two metal oxides iron oxide explaining the attraction to the magnet and of a white metallic oxide he could not identify realizing that the unidentified oxide contained a metal that did not match any known element in gregor reported his findings in both german and french science journals crell s annalen and observations et m moires sur la physique around the same time franz joseph m ller von reichenstein produced a similar substance but could not identify it the oxide was independently rediscovered in by prussian chemist martin heinrich klaproth in rutile from boinik the german name of bajm cska a village in hungary now bojni ky in slovakia klaproth found that it contained a new element and named it for the titans of greek mythology after hearing about gregor s earlier discovery he obtained a sample of manaccanite and confirmed that it contained titanium the currently known processes for extracting titanium from its various ores are laborious and costly it is not possible to reduce the ore by heating with carbon as in iron smelting because titanium combines with the carbon to produce titanium carbide pure metallic titanium was first prepared in by matthew a hunter at rensselaer polytechnic institute by heating ticl with sodium at c under great pressure in a batch process known as the hunter process titanium metal was not used outside the laboratory until when william justin kroll produced it by reducing titanium tetrachloride ticl with calcium eight years later he refined this process with magnesium and with sodium in what became known as the kroll process although research continues to seek cheaper and more efficient routes such as the ffc cambridge process the kroll process is still predominantly used for commercial production titanium of very high purity was made in small quantities when anton eduard van arkel and jan hendrik de boer discovered the iodide process in by reacting with iodine and decomposing the formed vapors over a hot filament to pure metal in the s and s the soviet union pioneered the use of titanium in military and submarine applications alfa class and mike class as part of programs related to the cold war starting in the early s titanium came into use extensively in military aviation particularly in high performance jets starting with aircraft such as the f super sabre and lockheed a and sr throughout the cold war period titanium was considered a strategic material by the u s government and a large stockpile of titanium sponge a porous form of the pure metal was maintained by the defense national stockpile center until the stockpile was dispersed in the s as of the four leading producers of titanium sponge were china japan russia and kazakhstan production the processing of titanium metal occurs in four major steps reduction of titanium ore into sponge a porous form melting of sponge or sponge plus a master alloy to form an ingot primary fabrication where an ingot is converted into general mill products such as billet bar plate sheet strip and tube and secondary fabrication of finished shapes from mill products because it cannot be readily produced by reduction of titanium dioxide titanium metal is obtained by reduction of ticl with magnesium metal in the kroll process the complexity of this batch production in the kroll process explains the relatively high market value of titanium despite the kroll process being less expensive than the hunter process to produce the ticl required by the kroll process the dioxide is subjected to carbothermic reduction in the presence of chlorine in this process the chlorine gas is passed over a red hot mixture of rutile or ilmenite in the presence of carbon after extensive purification by fractional distillation the ticl is reduced with c f molten magnesium in an argon atmosphere titanium metal can be further purified by the van arkel de boer process which involves thermal decomposition of titanium tetraiodide fetio cl c o c fecl ticl co displaystyle ce fetio cl c oc fecl ticl co ticl mg o c ti mgcl displaystyle ce ticl mg oc ti mgcl common titanium alloys are made by reduction for example cuprotitanium rutile with copper added is reduced ferrocarbon titanium ilmenite reduced with coke in an electric furnace and manganotitanium rutile with manganese or manganese oxides are reduced about fifty grades of titanium alloys are designed and currently used although only a couple of dozen are readily available commercially the astm international recognizes grades of titanium metal and alloys of which grades one through four are commercially pure unalloyed those four vary in tensile strength as a function of oxygen content with grade being the most ductile lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of and grade the least ductile highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of the remaining grades are alloys each designed for specific properties of ductility strength hardness electrical resistivity creep resistance specific corrosion resistance and combinations thereof in addition to the astm specifications titanium alloys are also produced to meet aerospace and military specifications sae ams mil t iso standards and country specific specifications as well as proprietary end user specifications for aerospace military medical and industrial applications titanium powder is manufactured using a flow production process known as the armstrong process that is similar to the batch production hunter process a stream of titanium tetrachloride gas is added to a stream of molten sodium the products sodium chloride salt and titanium particles is filtered from the extra sodium titanium is then separated from the salt by water washing both sodium and chlorine are recycled to produce and process more titanium tetrachloride fabrication all welding of titanium must be done in an inert atmosphere of argon or helium to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases oxygen nitrogen and hydrogen contamination causes a variety of conditions such as embrittlement which reduce the integrity of the assembly welds and lead to joint failure titanium is very difficult to solder directly and hence a solderable metal or alloy such as steel is coated on titanium prior to soldering titanium metal can be machined with the same equipment and the same processes as stainless steel forming and forging commercially pure flat product sheet plate can be formed readily but processing must take into account of the tendency of the metal to springback this is especially true of certain high strength alloys exposure to the oxygen in air at the elevated temperatures used in forging results in formation of an brittle oxygen rich metallic surface layer called alpha case that worsens the fatigue properties so it must be removed by milling etching or electrochemical treatment applications titanium is used in steel as an alloying element ferro titanium to reduce grain size and as a deoxidizer and in stainless steel to reduce carbon content titanium is often alloyed with aluminium to refine grain size vanadium copper to harden iron manganese molybdenum and other metals titanium mill products sheet plate bar wire forgings castings find application in industrial aerospace recreational and emerging markets powdered titanium is used in pyrotechnics as a source of bright burning particles pigments additives and coatings about of all titanium ore is destined for refinement into titanium dioxide tio an intensely white permanent pigment used in paints paper toothpaste and plastics it is also used in cement in gemstones as an optical opacifier in paper and a strengthening agent in graphite composite fishing rods and golf clubs tio pigment is chemically inert resists fading in sunlight and is very opaque it imparts a pure and brilliant white color to the brown or grey chemicals that form the majority of household plastics in nature this compound is found in the minerals anatase brookite and rutile paint made with titanium dioxide does well in severe temperatures and marine environments pure titanium dioxide has a very high index of refraction and an optical dispersion higher than diamond in addition to being a very important pigment titanium dioxide is also used in sunscreens aerospace and marine because titanium alloys have high tensile strength to density ratio high corrosion resistance fatigue resistance high crack resistance and ability to withstand moderately high temperatures without creeping they are used in aircraft armor plating naval ships spacecraft and missiles for these applications titanium is alloyed with aluminium zirconium nickel vanadium and other elements to manufacture a variety of components including critical structural parts fire walls landing gear exhaust ducts helicopters and hydraulic systems in fact about two thirds of all titanium metal produced is used in aircraft engines and frames the titanium al v alloy accounts for almost of all alloys used in aircraft applications the lockheed a and its development the sr blackbird were two of the first aircraft frames where titanium was used paving the way for much wider use in modern military and commercial aircraft a large amount of titanium mill products are used in the production of many aircraft such as following values are amount of raw mill products used only a fraction of this ends up in the finished aircraft metric tons are used in the boeing in the airbus a in the boeing in the boeing in the boeing in the airbus a in the airbus a and in the airbus a in aero engine applications titanium is used for rotors compressor blades hydraulic system components and nacelles an early use in jet engines was for the orenda iroquois in the s because titanium is resistant to corrosion by sea water it is used to make propeller shafts rigging and heat exchangers in desalination plants heater chillers for salt water aquariums fishing line and leader and divers knives titanium is used in the housings and components of ocean deployed surveillance and monitoring devices for science and the military the former soviet union developed techniques for making submarines with hulls of titanium alloys forging titanium in huge vacuum tubes titanium is used in the walls of the juno spacecraft s vault to shield on board electronics industrial welded titanium pipe and process equipment heat exchangers tanks process vessels valves are used in the chemical and petrochemical industries primarily for corrosion resistance specific alloys are used in oil and gas downhole applications and nickel hydrometallurgy for their high strength e g titanium beta c alloy corrosion resistance or both the pulp and paper industry uses titanium in process equipment exposed to corrosive media such as sodium hypochlorite or wet chlorine gas in the bleachery other applications include ultrasonic welding wave soldering and sputtering targets titanium tetrachloride ticl a colorless liquid is important as an intermediate in the process of making tio and is also used to produce the ziegler natta catalyst titanium tetrachloride is also used to iridize glass and because it fumes strongly in moist air it is used to make smoke screens consumer and architectural titanium metal is used in automotive applications particularly in automobile and motorcycle racing where low weight and high strength and rigidity are critical p the metal is generally too expensive for the general consumer market though some late model corvettes have been manufactured with titanium exhausts and a corvette z s lt supercharged engine uses lightweight solid titanium intake valves for greater strength and resistance to heat titanium is used in many sporting goods tennis rackets golf clubs lacrosse stick shafts cricket hockey lacrosse and football helmet grills and bicycle frames and components although not a mainstream material for bicycle production titanium bikes have been used by racing teams and adventure cyclists titanium alloys are used in spectacle frames that are rather expensive but highly durable long lasting light weight and cause no skin allergies many backpackers use titanium equipment including cookware eating utensils lanterns and tent stakes though slightly more expensive than traditional steel or aluminium alternatives titanium products can be significantly lighter without compromising strength titanium horseshoes are preferred to steel by farriers because they are lighter and more durable titanium has occasionally been used in architecture the m ft monument to yuri gagarin the first man to travel in space n e as well as the m ft monument to the conquerors of space on top of the cosmonaut museum in moscow are made of titanium for the metal s attractive color and association with rocketry the guggenheim museum bilbao and the cerritos millennium library were the first buildings in europe and north america respectively to be sheathed in titanium panels titanium sheathing was used in the frederic c hamilton building in denver colorado because of titanium s superior strength and light weight relative to other metals steel stainless steel and aluminium and because of recent advances in metalworking techniques its use has become more widespread in the manufacture of firearms primary uses include pistol frames and revolver cylinders for the same reasons it is used in the body of laptop computers for example in apple s powerbook line some upmarket lightweight and corrosion resistant tools such as shovels knife handles and flashlights are made of titanium or titanium alloys jewelry because of its durability titanium has become more popular for designer jewelry particularly titanium rings its inertness makes it a good choice for those with allergies or those who will be wearing the jewelry in environments such as swimming pools titanium is also alloyed with gold to produce an alloy that can be marketed as karat gold because the of alloyed ti is insufficient to require a lesser mark the resulting alloy is roughly the hardness of karat gold and is more durable than pure karat gold titanium s durability light weight and dent and corrosion resistance make it useful for watch cases some artists work with titanium to produce sculptures decorative objects and furniture titanium may be anodized to vary the thickness of the surface oxide layer causing optical interference fringes and a variety of bright colors with this coloration and chemical inertness titanium is a popular metal for body piercing titanium has a minor use in dedicated non circulating coins and medals in gibraltar released the world s first titanium coin for the millennium celebration the gold coast titans an australian rugby league team award a medal of pure titanium to their player of the year medical because titanium is biocompatible non toxic and not rejected by the body it has many medical uses including surgical implements and implants such as hip balls and sockets joint replacement and dental implants that can stay in place for up to years the titanium is often alloyed with about aluminium or al and vanadium titanium has the inherent ability to osseointegrate enabling use in dental implants that can last for over years this property is also useful for orthopedic implant applications these benefit from titanium s lower modulus of elasticity young s modulus to more closely match that of the bone that such devices are intended to repair as a result skeletal loads are more evenly shared between bone and implant leading to a lower incidence of bone degradation due to stress shielding and periprosthetic bone fractures which occur at the boundaries of orthopedic implants however titanium alloys stiffness is still more than twice that of bone so adjacent bone bears a greatly reduced load and may deteriorate because titanium is non ferromagnetic patients with titanium implants can be safely examined with magnetic resonance imaging convenient for long term implants preparing titanium for implantation in the body involves subjecting it to a high temperature plasma arc which removes the surface atoms exposing fresh titanium that is instantly oxidized modern advancements in additive manufacturing techniques have increased potential for titanium use in orthopedic implant applications complex implant scaffold designs can be d printed using titanium alloys which allows for more patient specific applications and increased implant osseointegration titanium is used for the surgical instruments used in image guided surgery as well as wheelchairs crutches and any other products where high strength and low weight are desirable titanium dioxide nanoparticles are widely used in electronics and the delivery of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics nuclear waste storage because of its corrosion resistance containers made of titanium have been studied for the long term storage of nuclear waste containers lasting more than years are thought possible with manufacturing conditions that minimize material defects a titanium drip shield could also be installed over containers of other types to enhance their longevity precautions titanium is non toxic even in large doses and does not play any natural role inside the human body an estimated quantity of milligrams of titanium is ingested by humans each day but most passes through without being absorbed in the tissues it does however sometimes bio accumulate in tissues that contain silica one study indicates a possible connection between titanium and yellow nail syndrome as a powder or in the form of metal shavings titanium metal poses a significant fire hazard and when heated in air an explosion hazard water and carbon dioxide are ineffective for extinguishing a titanium fire class d dry powder agents must be used instead when used in the production or handling of chlorine titanium should not be exposed to dry chlorine gas because it may result in a titanium chlorine fire titanium can catch fire when a fresh non oxidized surface comes in contact with liquid oxygen function in plants an unknown mechanism in plants may use titanium to stimulate the production of carbohydrates and encourage growth this may explain why most plants contain about part per million ppm of titanium food plants have about ppm and horsetail and nettle contain up to ppm ,22
Vanadium,V,vanadium is a chemical element with the symbol v and atomic number it is a hard silvery grey malleable transition metal the elemental metal is rarely found in nature but once isolated artificially the formation of an oxide layer passivation somewhat stabilizes the free metal against further oxidation spanish scientist andr s manuel del r o discovered compounds of vanadium in in mexico by analyzing a new lead bearing mineral he called brown lead though he initially presumed its qualities were due to the presence of a new element he was later erroneously convinced by french chemist hippolyte victor collet descotils that the element was just chromium then in nils gabriel sefstr m generated chlorides of vanadium thus proving there was a new element and named it vanadium after the scandinavian goddess of beauty and fertility vanad s freyja the name was based on the wide range of colors found in vanadium compounds del rio s lead mineral was ultimately named vanadinite for its vanadium content in henry enfield roscoe obtained the pure element vanadium occurs naturally in about minerals and in fossil fuel deposits it is produced in china and russia from steel smelter slag other countries produce it either from magnetite directly flue dust of heavy oil or as a byproduct of uranium mining it is mainly used to produce specialty steel alloys such as high speed tool steels and some aluminium alloys the most important industrial vanadium compound vanadium pentoxide is used as a catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid the vanadium redox battery for energy storage may be an important application in the future large amounts of vanadium ions are found in a few organisms possibly as a toxin the oxide and some other salts of vanadium have moderate toxicity particularly in the ocean vanadium is used by some life forms as an active center of enzymes such as the vanadium bromoperoxidase of some ocean algae history vanadium was discovered in by the spanish mineralogist andr s manuel del r o del r o extracted the element from a sample of mexican brown lead ore later named vanadinite he found that its salts exhibit a wide variety of colors and as a result he named the element panchromium greek all colors later del r o renamed the element erythronium greek red because most of the salts turned red upon heating in french chemist hippolyte victor collet descotils backed by del r o s friend baron alexander von humboldt incorrectly declared that del r o s new element was an impure sample of chromium del r o accepted collet descotils statement and retracted his claim in swedish chemist nils gabriel sefstr m rediscovered the element in a new oxide he found while working with iron ores later that year friedrich w hler confirmed del r o s earlier work sefstr m chose a name beginning with v which had not yet been assigned to any element he called the element vanadium after old norse vanad s another name for the norse vanir goddess freyja whose attributes include beauty and fertility because of the many beautifully colored chemical compounds it produces in the geologist george william featherstonhaugh suggested that vanadium should be renamed rionium after del r o but this suggestion was not followed the isolation of vanadium metal was difficult in berzelius reported the production of the metal but henry enfield roscoe showed that berzelius had produced the nitride vanadium nitride vn roscoe eventually produced the metal in by reduction of vanadium ii chloride vcl with hydrogen in pure vanadium was produced by reducing vanadium pentoxide with calcium the first large scale industrial use of vanadium was in the steel alloy chassis of the ford model t inspired by french race cars vanadium steel allowed reduced weight while increasing tensile strength ca for the first decade of the th century most vanadium ore was mined by american vanadium company from the minas ragra in peru later the demand for uranium rose leading to increased mining of that metal s ores one major uranium ore was carnotite which also contains vanadium thus vanadium became available as a by product of uranium production eventually uranium mining began to supply a large share of the demand for vanadium in german chemist martin henze discovered vanadium in the hemovanadin proteins found in blood cells or coelomic cells of ascidiacea sea squirts characteristics vanadium is an average hard ductile steel blue metal it is electrically conductive and thermally insulating some sources describe vanadium as soft perhaps because it is ductile malleable and not brittle vanadium is harder than most metals and steels see hardnesses of the elements data page and iron it has good resistance to corrosion and it is stable against alkalis and sulfuric and hydrochloric acids it is oxidized in air at about k c f although an oxide passivation layer forms even at room temperature isotopes naturally occurring vanadium is composed of one stable isotope v and one radioactive isotope v the latter has a half life of years and a natural abundance of v has a nuclear spin of which is useful for nmr spectroscopy twenty four artificial radioisotopes have been characterized ranging in mass number from to the most stable of these isotopes are v with a half life of days and v with a half life of days the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives shorter than an hour most below seconds at least four isotopes have metastable excited states electron capture is the main decay mode for isotopes lighter than v for the heavier ones the most common mode is beta decay the electron capture reactions lead to the formation of element titanium isotopes while beta decay leads to element chromium isotopes compounds the chemistry of vanadium is noteworthy for the accessibility of the four adjacent oxidation states in aqueous solution vanadium forms metal aquo complexes of which the colours are lilac v h o green v h o blue vo h o yellow orange oxides vo h o the formula for which depends on ph vanadium ii compounds are reducing agents and vanadium v compounds are oxidizing agents vanadium iv compounds often exist as vanadyl derivatives which contain the vo center ammonium vanadate v nh vo can be successively reduced with elemental zinc to obtain the different colors of vanadium in these four oxidation states lower oxidation states occur in compounds such as v co v co and substituted derivatives vanadium pentoxide is a commercially important catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid a reaction that exploits the ability of vanadium oxides to undergo redox reactions the vanadium redox battery utilizes all four oxidation states one electrode uses the couple and the other uses the couple conversion of these oxidation states is illustrated by the reduction of a strongly acidic solution of a vanadium v compound with zinc dust or amalgam the initial yellow color characteristic of the pervanadyl ion vo h o is replaced by the blue color of vo h o followed by the green color of v h o and then the violet color of v h o oxyanions in aqueous solution vanadium v forms an extensive family of oxyanions as established by v nmr spectroscopy the interrelationships in this family are described by the predominance diagram which shows at least species depending on ph and concentration the tetrahedral orthovanadate ion vo is the principal species present at ph similar in size and charge to phosphorus v vanadium v also parallels its chemistry and crystallography orthovanadate vo is used in protein crystallography to study the biochemistry of phosphate beside that this anion also has been shown to interact with activity of some specific enzymes the tetrathiovanadate vs is analogous to the orthovanadate ion at lower ph values the monomer hvo and dimer v o are formed with the monomer predominant at vanadium concentration of less than c m pv where pv is equal to the minus value of the logarithm of the total vanadium concentration m the formation of the divanadate ion is analogous to the formation of the dichromate ion as the ph is reduced further protonation and condensation to polyvanadates occur at ph h vo is predominant at pv greater than ca while at higher concentrations trimers and tetramers are formed between ph decavanadate predominates its formation from orthovanadate is represented by this condensation reaction vo h v o h oin decavanadate each v v center is surrounded by six oxide ligands vanadic acid h vo exists only at very low concentrations because protonation of the tetrahedral species h vo results in the preferential formation of the octahedral vo h o species in strongly acidic solutions ph vo h o is the predominant species while the oxide v o precipitates from solution at high concentrations the oxide is formally the acid anhydride of vanadic acid the structures of many vanadate compounds have been determined by x ray crystallography vanadium v forms various peroxo complexes most notably in the active site of the vanadium containing bromoperoxidase enzymes the species vo o h o is stable in acidic solutions in alkaline solutions species with and peroxide groups are known the last forms violet salts with the formula m v o nh o m li na etc in which the vanadium has an coordinate dodecahedral structure halide derivatives twelve binary halides compounds with the formula vxn n are known vi vcl vbr and vi do not exist or are extremely unstable in combination with other reagents vcl is used as a catalyst for polymerization of dienes like all binary halides those of vanadium are lewis acidic especially those of v iv and v v many of the halides form octahedral complexes with the formula vxnl n x halide l other ligand many vanadium oxyhalides formula vomxn are known the oxytrichloride and oxytrifluoride vocl and vof are the most widely studied akin to pocl they are volatile adopt tetrahedral structures in the gas phase and are lewis acidic coordination compounds complexes of vanadium ii and iii are relatively exchange inert and reducing those of v iv and v v are oxidants vanadium ion is rather large and some complexes achieve coordination numbers greater than as is the case in v cn oxovanadium v also forms coordinate coordination complexes with tetradentate ligands and peroxides and these complexes are used for oxidative brominations and thioether oxidations the coordination chemistry of v is dominated by the vanadyl center vo which binds four other ligands strongly and one weakly the one trans to the vanadyl center an example is vanadyl acetylacetonate v o o c h in this complex the vanadium is coordinate distorted square pyramidal meaning that a sixth ligand such as pyridine may be attached though the association constant of this process is small many coordinate vanadyl complexes have a trigonal bipyramidal geometry such as vocl nme the coordination chemistry of v is dominated by the relatively stable dioxovanadium coordination complexes which are often formed by aerial oxidation of the vanadium iv precursors indicating the stability of the oxidation state and ease of interconversion between the and states organometallic compounds organometallic chemistry of vanadium is well developed vanadocene dichloride is a versatile starting reagent and has applications in organic chemistry vanadium carbonyl v co is a rare example of a paramagnetic metal carbonyl reduction yields v co isoelectronic with cr co which may be further reduced with sodium in liquid ammonia to yield v co isoelectronic with fe co occurrence universe the cosmic abundance of vanadium in the universe is making the element nearly as common as copper or zinc vanadium is detected spectroscopically in light from the sun and sometimes in the light from other stars earth s crust vanadium is the th most abundant element in the earth s crust metallic vanadium is rare in nature known as native vanadium but vanadium compounds occur naturally in about different minerals at the beginning of the th century a large deposit of vanadium ore was discovered the minas ragra vanadium mine near jun n cerro de pasco peru for several years this patr nite vs deposit was an economically significant source for vanadium ore in roughly two thirds of the worldwide production was supplied by the mine in peru with the production of uranium in the s and s from carnotite k uo vo h o vanadium became available as a side product of uranium production vanadinite pb vo cl and other vanadium bearing minerals are only mined in exceptional cases with the rising demand much of the world s vanadium production is now sourced from vanadium bearing magnetite found in ultramafic gabbro bodies if this titanomagnetite is used to produce iron most of the vanadium goes to the slag and is extracted from it vanadium is mined mostly in south africa north western china and eastern russia in these three countries mined more than of the tonnes of produced vanadium vanadium is also present in bauxite and in deposits of crude oil coal oil shale and tar sands in crude oil concentrations up to ppm have been reported when such oil products are burned traces of vanadium may cause corrosion in engines and boilers an estimated tonnes of vanadium per year are released into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels black shales are also a potential source of vanadium during ww ii some vanadium was extracted from alum shales in the south of sweden water the vanadyl ion is abundant in seawater having an average concentration of nm mg m some mineral water springs also contain the ion in high concentrations for example springs near mount fuji contain as much as g per liter production vanadium metal is obtained by a multistep process that begins with roasting crushed ore with nacl or na co at about c to give sodium metavanadate navo an aqueous extract of this solid is acidified to produce red cake a polyvanadate salt which is reduced with calcium metal as an alternative for small scale production vanadium pentoxide is reduced with hydrogen or magnesium many other methods are also used in all of which vanadium is produced as a byproduct of other processes purification of vanadium is possible by the crystal bar process developed by anton eduard van arkel and jan hendrik de boer in it involves the formation of the metal iodide in this example vanadium iii iodide and the subsequent decomposition to yield pure metal v i vi most vanadium is used as a steel alloy called ferrovanadium ferrovanadium is produced directly by reducing a mixture of vanadium oxide iron oxides and iron in an electric furnace the vanadium ends up in pig iron produced from vanadium bearing magnetite depending on the ore used the slag contains up to of vanadium china is the world s largest producer of vanadium applications alloys approximately of the vanadium produced is used as ferrovanadium or as a steel additive the considerable increase of strength in steel containing small amounts of vanadium was discovered in the early th century vanadium forms stable nitrides and carbides resulting in a significant increase in the strength of steel from that time on vanadium steel was used for applications in axles bicycle frames crankshafts gears and other critical components there are two groups of vanadium steel alloys vanadium high carbon steel alloys contain to vanadium and high speed tool steels hss have a vanadium content of to for high speed tool steels a hardness above hrc can be achieved hss steel is used in surgical instruments and tools powder metallurgic alloys contain up to percent vanadium the high content of vanadium carbides in those alloys increases wear resistance significantly one application for those alloys is tools and knives vanadium stabilizes the beta form of titanium and increases the strength and temperature stability of titanium mixed with aluminium in titanium alloys it is used in jet engines high speed airframes and dental implants the most common alloy for seamless tubing is titanium containing vanadium the titanium alloy of choice in the aerospace defense and bicycle industries another common alloy primarily produced in sheets is titanium al v a titanium alloy with aluminium and vanadium several vanadium alloys show superconducting behavior the first a phase superconductor was a vanadium compound v si which was discovered in vanadium gallium tape is used in superconducting magnets teslas or gauss the structure of the superconducting a phase of v ga is similar to that of the more common nb sn and nb ti it has been found that a small amount to ppm of vanadium in wootz steel significantly improved the strength of the product and gave it the distinctive patterning the source of the vanadium in the original wootz steel ingots remains unknown vanadium can be used as a substitute for molybdenum in armor steel though the alloy produced is far more brittle and prone to spalling on non penetrating impacts the third reich was one of the most prominent users of such alloys in armored vehicles like tiger ii or jagdtiger catalysts vanadium compounds are used extensively as catalysts vanadium pentoxide v o is used as a catalyst in manufacturing sulfuric acid by the contact process in this process sulfur dioxide so is oxidized to the trioxide so in this redox reaction sulfur is oxidized from to and vanadium is reduced from to v o so vo so the catalyst is regenerated by oxidation with air vo o v o similar oxidations are used in the production of maleic anhydride c h o c h o h ophthalic anhydride and several other bulk organic compounds are produced similarly these green chemistry processes convert inexpensive feedstocks to highly functionalized versatile intermediates vanadium is an important component of mixed metal oxide catalysts used in the oxidation of propane and propylene to acrolein acrylic acid or the ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile in service the oxidation state of vanadium changes dynamically and reversibly with the oxygen and the steam content of the reacting feed mixture glass coatings and ceramics another oxide of vanadium vanadium dioxide vo is used in the production of glass coatings which blocks infrared radiation and not visible light at a specific temperature vanadium oxide can be used to induce color centers in corundum to create simulated alexandrite jewelry although alexandrite in nature is a chrysoberyl vanadium pentoxide is used in ceramics other uses the vanadium redox battery a type of flow battery is an electrochemical cell consisting of aqueous vanadium ions in different oxidation states batteries of the type were first proposed in the s and developed commercially from the s onwards cells use and formal oxidization state ions vanadium redox batteries are used commercially for grid energy storage vanadate can be used for protecting steel against rust and corrosion by conversion coating vanadium foil is used in cladding titanium to steel because it is compatible with both iron and titanium the moderate thermal neutron capture cross section and the short half life of the isotopes produced by neutron capture makes vanadium a suitable material for the inner structure of a fusion reactor proposed lithium vanadium oxide has been proposed for use as a high energy density anode for lithium ion batteries at wh l when paired with a lithium cobalt oxide cathode vanadium phosphates have been proposed as the cathode in the lithium vanadium phosphate battery another type of lithium ion battery biological role vanadium is more important in marine environments than terrestrial vanadoenzymes a number of species of marine algae produce vanadium bromoperoxidase as well as the closely related chloroperoxidase which may use a heme or vanadium cofactor and iodoperoxidases the bromoperoxidase produces an estimated million tons of bromoform and tons of bromomethane annually most naturally occurring organobromine compounds are produced by this enzyme catalyzing the following reaction r h is hydrocarbon substrate r h br h o r br h o oh a vanadium nitrogenase is used by some nitrogen fixing micro organisms such as azotobacter in this role vanadium serves in place of the more common molybdenum or iron and gives the nitrogenase slightly different properties vanadium accumulation in tunicates vanadium is essential to tunicates where it is stored in the highly acidified vacuoles of certain blood cell types designated vanadocytes vanabins vanadium binding proteins have been identified in the cytoplasm of such cells the concentration of vanadium in the blood of ascidian tunicates is as much as ten million times higher than the surrounding seawater which normally contains to g l the function of this vanadium concentration system and these vanadium bearing proteins is still unknown but the vanadocytes are later deposited just under the outer surface of the tunic where they may deter predation fungi amanita muscaria and related species of macrofungi accumulate vanadium up to mg kg in dry weight vanadium is present in the coordination complex amavadin in fungal fruit bodies the biological importance of the accumulation is unknown toxic or peroxidase enzyme functions have been suggested mammals deficiencies in vanadium result in reduced growth in rats the u s institute of medicine has not confirmed that vanadium is an essential nutrient for humans so neither a recommended dietary intake nor an adequate intake have been established dietary intake is estimated at to g day with less than absorbed the tolerable upper intake level ul of dietary vanadium beyond which adverse effects may occur is set at mg day research vanadyl sulfate as a dietary supplement has been researched as a means of increasing insulin sensitivity or otherwise improving glycemic control in people who are diabetic some of the trials had significant treatment effects but were deemed as being of poor study quality the amounts of vanadium used in these trials to mg far exceeded the safe upper limit the conclusion of the systemic review was there is no rigorous evidence that oral vanadium supplementation improves glycaemic control in type diabetes the routine use of vanadium for this purpose cannot be recommended in astrobiology it has been suggested that discrete vanadium accumulations on mars could be a potential microbial biosignature when used in conjunction with raman spectroscopy and morphology safety all vanadium compounds should be considered toxic tetravalent voso has been reported to be at least times more toxic than trivalent v o the occupational safety and health administration osha has set an exposure limit of mg m for vanadium pentoxide dust and mg m for vanadium pentoxide fumes in workplace air for an hour workday hour work week the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has recommended that mg m of vanadium be considered immediately dangerous to life and health that is likely to cause permanent health problems or death vanadium compounds are poorly absorbed through the gastrointestinal system inhalation of vanadium and vanadium compounds results primarily in adverse effects on the respiratory system quantitative data are however insufficient to derive a subchronic or chronic inhalation reference dose other effects have been reported after oral or inhalation exposures on blood parameters liver neurological development and other organs in rats there is little evidence that vanadium or vanadium compounds are reproductive toxins or teratogens vanadium pentoxide was reported to be carcinogenic in male rats and in male and female mice by inhalation in an ntp study although the interpretation of the results has recently been disputed the carcinogenicity of vanadium has not been determined by the united states environmental protection agency vanadium traces in diesel fuels are the main fuel component in high temperature corrosion during combustion vanadium oxidizes and reacts with sodium and sulfur yielding vanadate compounds with melting points as low as c which attack the passivation layer on steel and render it susceptible to corrosion the solid vanadium compounds also abrade engine components ,23
Chromium,Cr,chromium is a chemical element with the symbol cr and atomic number it is the first element in group it is a steely grey lustrous hard and brittle transition metal chromium metal is valued for its high corrosion resistance and hardness a major development in steel production was the discovery that steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding metallic chromium to form stainless steel stainless steel and chrome plating electroplating with chromium together comprise of the commercial use chromium is also greatly valued as a metal that is able to be highly polished while resisting tarnishing polished chromium reflects almost of the visible spectrum and almost of infrared light the name of the element is derived from the greek word chr ma meaning color because many chromium compounds are intensely colored industrial production of chromium proceeds from chromite ore mostly fecr o to produce ferrochromium an iron chromium alloy by means of aluminothermic or silicothermic reactions ferrochromium is then used to produce alloys such as stainless steel pure chromium metal is produced by a different process roasting and leaching of chromite to separate it from iron followed by reduction with carbon and then aluminium in the united states trivalent chromium cr iii ion is considered an essential nutrient in humans for insulin sugar and lipid metabolism however in the european food safety authority acting for the european union concluded that there was insufficient evidence for chromium to be recognized as essential while chromium metal and cr iii ions are considered non toxic hexavalent chromium cr vi is toxic and carcinogenic according to the european chemicals agency echa chromium trioxide that is used in industrial electroplating processes is a substance of very high concern svhc abandoned chromium production sites often require environmental cleanup physical properties atomic chromium is the fourth transition metal found on the periodic table and has an electron configuration of ar d s it is also the first element in the periodic table whose ground state electron configuration violates the aufbau principle this occurs again later in the periodic table with other elements and their electron configurations such as copper niobium and molybdenum this occurs because electrons in the same orbital repel each other due to their like charges in the previous elements the energetic cost of promoting an electron to the next higher energy level is too great to compensate for that released by lessening inter electronic repulsion however in the d transition metals the energy gap between the d and the next higher s subshell is very small and because the d subshell is more compact than the s subshell inter electron repulsion is smaller between s electrons than between d electrons this lowers the energetic cost of promotion and increases the energy released by it so that the promotion becomes energetically feasible and one or even two electrons are always promoted to the s subshell similar promotions happen for every transition metal atom but one palladium chromium is the first element in the d series where the d electrons start to sink into the nucleus they thus contribute less to metallic bonding and hence the melting and boiling points and the enthalpy of atomisation of chromium are lower than those of the preceding element vanadium chromium vi is a strong oxidising agent in contrast to the molybdenum vi and tungsten vi oxides bulk chromium is extremely hard and is the third hardest element behind carbon diamond and boron its mohs hardness is which means that it can scratch samples of quartz and topaz but can be scratched by corundum chromium is highly resistant to tarnishing which makes it useful as a metal that preserves its outermost layer from corroding unlike other metals such as copper magnesium and aluminium chromium has a melting point of c f which is relatively low compared to the majority of transition metals however it still has the second highest melting point out of all the period elements being topped by vanadium by c f at c f the boiling point of c f however is comparatively lower having the fourth lowest boiling point out of the period transition metals alone behind copper manganese and zinc the electrical resistivity of chromium at c is nanoohm meters chromium has a high specular reflection in comparison to other transition metals in infrared at m chromium has a maximum reflectance of about reducing to a minimum of at m before rising again to at m when chromium is used in stainless steel alloys and polished the specular reflection decreases with the inclusion of additional metals yet is still high in comparison with other alloys between and of the visible spectrum is reflected from polished stainless steel the explanation on why chromium displays such a high turnout of reflected photon waves in general especially the in infrared can be attributed to chromium s magnetic properties chromium has unique magnetic properties chromium is the only elemental solid that shows antiferromagnetic ordering at room temperature and below above c its magnetic ordering becomes paramagnetic the antiferromagnetic properties which cause the chromium atoms to temporarily ionize and bond with themselves are present because the body centric cubic s magnetic properties are disproportionate to the lattice periodicity this is due to the magnetic moments at the cube s corners and the unequal but antiparallel cube centers from here the frequency dependent relative permittivity of chromium deriving from maxwell s equations and chromium s antiferromagnetism leaves chromium with a high infrared and visible light reflectance passivation chromium metal left standing in air is passivated it forms a thin protective surface layer of oxide this layer has a spinel structure a few atomic layers thick it is very dense and inhibits the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal in contrast iron forms a more porous oxide through which oxygen can migrate causing continued rusting passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid passivated chromium is stable against acids passivation can be removed with a strong reducing agent that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids chromium unlike iron and nickel does not suffer from hydrogen embrittlement however it does suffer from nitrogen embrittlement reacting with nitrogen from air and forming brittle nitrides at the high temperatures necessary to work the metal parts isotopes naturally occurring chromium is composed of three stable isotopes cr cr and cr with cr being the most abundant natural abundance radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being cr with a half life of more than years and cr with a half life of days all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are less than hours and the majority less than minute chromium also has two metastable nuclear isomers cr is the radiogenic decay product of mn half life million years chromium isotopes are typically collocated and compounded with manganese isotopes this circumstance is useful in isotope geology manganese chromium isotope ratios reinforce the evidence from al and pd concerning the early history of the solar system variations in cr cr and mn cr ratios from several meteorites indicate an initial mn mn ratio that suggests mn cr isotopic composition must result from in situ decay of mn in differentiated planetary bodies hence cr provides additional evidence for nucleosynthetic processes immediately before coalescence of the solar system the isotopes of chromium range in atomic mass from u cr to u cr the primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope cr is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta decay cr has been posited as a proxy for atmospheric oxygen concentration chemistry and compounds chromium is a member of group of the transition metals the and states occur most commonly within chromium compounds followed by charges of and for chromium are rare but do nevertheless occasionally exist common oxidation states chromium many cr complexes are known bis benzene chromium and chromium hexacarbonyl are highlights in organochromium chemistry chromium ii chromium ii compounds are uncommon in part because they readily oxidize to chromium iii derivatives in air water stable chromium ii chloride crcl that can be made by reducing chromium iii chloride with zinc the resulting bright blue solution created from dissolving chromium ii chloride is stable at neutral ph some other notable chromium ii compounds include chromium ii oxide cro and chromium ii sulfate crso many chromium ii carboxylates are known the red chromium ii acetate cr o cch is somewhat famous it features a cr cr quadruple bond chromium iii a large number of chromium iii compounds are known such as chromium iii nitrate chromium iii acetate and chromium iii oxide chromium iii can be obtained by dissolving elemental chromium in acids like hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid but it can also be formed through the reduction of chromium vi by cytochrome c the cr ion has a similar radius pm to al radius pm and they can replace each other in some compounds such as in chrome alum and alum chromium iii tends to form octahedral complexes commercially available chromium iii chloride hydrate is the dark green complex crcl h o cl closely related compounds are the pale green crcl h o cl and violet cr h o cl if anhydrous violet chromium iii chloride is dissolved in water the violet solution turns green after some time as the chloride in the inner coordination sphere is replaced by water this kind of reaction is also observed with solutions of chrome alum and other water soluble chromium iii salts a tetrahedral coordination of chromium iii has been reported for the cr centered keggin anion crw o chromium iii hydroxide cr oh is amphoteric dissolving in acidic solutions to form cr h o and in basic solutions to form cr oh it is dehydrated by heating to form the green chromium iii oxide cr o a stable oxide with a crystal structure identical to that of corundum chromium vi chromium vi compounds are oxidants at low or neutral ph chromate anions cro and dichromate cr o anions are the principal ions at this oxidation state they exist at an equilibrium determined by ph cro h cr o h ochromium vi oxyhalides are known also and include chromyl fluoride cro f and chromyl chloride cro cl however despite several erroneous claims chromium hexafluoride as well as all higher hexahalides remains unknown as of sodium chromate is produced industrially by the oxidative roasting of chromite ore with sodium carbonate the change in equilibrium is visible by a change from yellow chromate to orange dichromate such as when an acid is added to a neutral solution of potassium chromate at yet lower ph values further condensation to more complex oxyanions of chromium is possible both the chromate and dichromate anions are strong oxidizing reagents at low ph cr o h o e cr h o v they are however only moderately oxidizing at high ph cro h o e cr oh oh v chromium vi compounds in solution can be detected by adding an acidic hydrogen peroxide solution the unstable dark blue chromium vi peroxide cro is formed which can be stabilized as an ether adduct cro or chromic acid has the hypothetical formula h cro it is a vaguely described chemical despite many well defined chromates and dichromates being known the dark red chromium vi oxide cro the acid anhydride of chromic acid is sold industrially as chromic acid it can be produced by mixing sulfuric acid with dichromate and is a strong oxidizing agent other oxidation states compounds of chromium v are rather rare the oxidation state is only realized in few compounds but are intermediates in many reactions involving oxidations by chromate the only binary compound is the volatile chromium v fluoride crf this red solid has a melting point of c and a boiling point of c it can be prepared by treating chromium metal with fluorine at c and bar pressure the peroxochromate v is another example of the oxidation state potassium peroxochromate k cr o is made by reacting potassium chromate with hydrogen peroxide at low temperatures this red brown compound is stable at room temperature but decomposes spontaneously at c compounds of chromium iv are slightly more common than those of chromium v the tetrahalides crf crcl and crbr can be produced by treating the trihalides crx with the corresponding halogen at elevated temperatures such compounds are susceptible to disproportionation reactions and are not stable in water organic compounds containing cr iv state such as chromium tetra t butoxide are also known most chromium i compounds are obtained solely by oxidation of electron rich octahedral chromium complexes other chromium i complexes contain cyclopentadienyl ligands as verified by x ray diffraction a cr cr quintuple bond length pm has also been described extremely bulky monodentate ligands stabilize this compound by shielding the quintuple bond from further reactions occurrence chromium is the st most abundant element in earth s crust with an average concentration of ppm chromium compounds are found in the environment from the erosion of chromium containing rocks and can be redistributed by volcanic eruptions typical background concentrations of chromium in environmental media are atmosphere ng m soil mg kg vegetation mg kg freshwater g l seawater g l sediment mg kg chromium is mined as chromite fecr o ore about two fifths of the chromite ores and concentrates in the world are produced in south africa about a third in kazakhstan while india russia and turkey are also substantial producers untapped chromite deposits are plentiful but geographically concentrated in kazakhstan and southern africa although rare deposits of native chromium exist the udachnaya pipe in russia produces samples of the native metal this mine is a kimberlite pipe rich in diamonds and the reducing environment helped produce both elemental chromium and diamonds the relation between cr iii and cr vi strongly depends on ph and oxidative properties of the location in most cases cr iii is the dominating species but in some areas the ground water can contain up to g l of total chromium of which g l is cr vi history early applications chromium minerals as pigments came to the attention of the west in the eighteenth century on july johann gottlob lehmann found an orange red mineral in the beryozovskoye mines in the ural mountains which he named siberian red lead though misidentified as a lead compound with selenium and iron components the mineral was in fact crocoite with a formula of pbcro in peter simon pallas visited the same site as lehmann and found a red lead mineral that was discovered to possess useful properties as a pigment in paints after pallas the use of siberian red lead as a paint pigment began to develop rapidly throughout the region crocoite would be the principal source of chromium in pigments until the discovery of chromite many years later in louis nicolas vauquelin received samples of crocoite ore he produced chromium trioxide cro by mixing crocoite with hydrochloric acid in vauquelin discovered that he could isolate metallic chromium by heating the oxide in a charcoal oven for which he is credited as the one who truly discovered the element vauquelin was also able to detect traces of chromium in precious gemstones such as ruby and emerald during the nineteenth century chromium was primarily used not only as a component of paints but in tanning salts as well for quite some time the crocoite found in russia was the main source for such tanning materials in a larger chromite deposit was discovered near baltimore united states which quickly met the demand for tanning salts much more adequately than the crocoite that had been used previously this made the united states the largest producer of chromium products until the year when larger deposits of chromite were uncovered near the city of bursa turkey with the development of metallurgy and chemical industries in the western world the need for chromium increased chromium is also famous for its reflective metallic luster when polished it is used as a protective and decorative coating on car parts plumbing fixtures furniture parts and many other items usually applied by electroplating chromium was used for electroplating as early as but this use only became widespread with the development of an improved process in production approximately million metric tons mt of marketable chromite ore was produced in and converted into mt of ferrochromium according to john f papp writing for the usgs ferrochromium is the leading end use of chromite ore and stainless steel is the leading end use of ferrochromium the largest producers of chromium ore in have been south africa kazakhstan turkey and india with several other countries producing the rest of about of the world production the two main products of chromium ore refining are ferrochromium and metallic chromium for those products the ore smelter process differs considerably for the production of ferrochromium the chromite ore fecr o is reduced in large scale in electric arc furnace or in smaller smelters with either aluminium or silicon in an aluminothermic reaction for the production of pure chromium the iron must be separated from the chromium in a two step roasting and leaching process the chromite ore is heated with a mixture of calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate in the presence of air the chromium is oxidized to the hexavalent form while the iron forms the stable fe o the subsequent leaching at higher elevated temperatures dissolves the chromates and leaves the insoluble iron oxide the chromate is converted by sulfuric acid into the dichromate fecr o na co o na cro fe o co na cro h so na cr o na so h othe dichromate is converted to the chromium iii oxide by reduction with carbon and then reduced in an aluminothermic reaction to chromium na cr o c cr o na co co cr o al al o cr applications the creation of metal alloys account for of the available chromium s usage the remainder of chromium is used in the chemical refractory and foundry industries metallurgy the strengthening effect of forming stable metal carbides at grain boundaries and the strong increase in corrosion resistance made chromium an important alloying material for steel high speed tool steels contain between and chromium stainless steel the primary corrosion resistant metal alloy is formed when chromium is introduced to iron in concentrations above for stainless steel s formation ferrochromium is added to the molten iron also nickel based alloys have increased strength due to the formation of discrete stable metal carbide particles at the grain boundaries for example inconel contains chromium because of the excellent high temperature properties of these nickel superalloys they are used in jet engines and gas turbines in lieu of common structural materials astm b relies on chromium for condenser and heat exchanger tubes while castings with high strength at elevated temperatures that contain chromium are standardised with astm a aisi type is used where high temperature would normally cause carburization oxidation or corrosion incoloy is capable of remaining stable and maintaining its austenitic structure even after long time exposures to high temperatures nichrome is used as resistance wire for heating elements in things like toasters and space heaters these uses make chromium a strategic material consequently during world war ii u s road engineers were instructed to avoid chromium in yellow road paint as it may become a critical material during the emergency the united states likewise considered chromium essential for the german war industry and made intense diplomatic efforts to keep it out of the hands of nazi germany the high hardness and corrosion resistance of unalloyed chromium makes it a reliable metal for surface coating it is still the most popular metal for sheet coating with its above average durability compared to other coating metals a layer of chromium is deposited on pretreated metallic surfaces by electroplating techniques there are two deposition methods thin and thick thin deposition involves a layer of chromium below m thickness deposited by chrome plating and is used for decorative surfaces thicker chromium layers are deposited if wear resistant surfaces are needed both methods use acidic chromate or dichromate solutions to prevent the energy consuming change in oxidation state the use of chromium iii sulfate is under development for most applications of chromium the previously established process is used in the chromate conversion coating process the strong oxidative properties of chromates are used to deposit a protective oxide layer on metals like aluminium zinc and cadmium this passivation and the self healing properties of the chromate stored in the chromate conversion coating which is able to migrate to local defects are the benefits of this coating method because of environmental and health regulations on chromates alternative coating methods are under development chromic acid anodizing or type i anodizing of aluminium is another electrochemical process that does not lead to the deposition of chromium but uses chromic acid as an electrolyte in the solution during anodization an oxide layer is formed on the aluminium the use of chromic acid instead of the normally used sulfuric acid leads to a slight difference of these oxide layers the high toxicity of cr vi compounds used in the established chromium electroplating process and the strengthening of safety and environmental regulations demand a search for substitutes for chromium or at least a change to less toxic chromium iii compounds pigment the mineral crocoite which is also lead chromate pbcro was used as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery after a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite chrome yellow was together with cadmium yellow one of the most used yellow pigments the pigment does not photodegrade but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium iii oxide it has a strong color and was used for school buses in the united states and for the postal services for example the deutsche post in europe the use of chrome yellow has since declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or other alternatives that are free from lead and chromium other pigments that are based around chromium are for example the deep shade of red pigment chrome red which is simply lead chromate with lead ii hydroxide pbcro pb oh a very important chromate pigment which was used widely in metal primer formulations was zinc chromate now replaced by zinc phosphate a wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pre treating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution this used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral an solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application it was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient a thin layer of about m was applied which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured there is still a question as to the correct mechanism chrome green is a mixture of prussian blue and chrome yellow while the chrome oxide green is chromium iii oxide chromium oxides are also used as a green pigment in the field of glassmaking and also as a glaze for ceramics green chromium oxide is extremely lightfast and as such is used in cladding coatings it is also the main ingredient in infrared reflecting paints used by the armed forces to paint vehicles and to give them the same infrared reflectance as green leaves other uses chromium iii ions present in corundum crystals aluminium oxide cause them to be colored red when corundum appears as such it is known as a ruby if the corundum is lacking in chromium iii ions it is known as a sapphire a red colored artificial ruby may also be achieved by doping chromium iii into artificial corundum crystals thus making chromium a requirement for making synthetic rubies such a synthetic ruby crystal was the basis for the first laser produced in which relied on stimulated emission of light from the chromium atoms in such a crystal ruby has a laser transition at nanometers in a deep red color because of their toxicity chromium vi salts are used for the preservation of wood for example chromated copper arsenate cca is used in timber treatment to protect wood from decay fungi wood attacking insects including termites and marine borers the formulations contain chromium based on the oxide cro between and in the united states metric tons of cca solution were used in chromium iii salts especially chrome alum and chromium iii sulfate are used in the tanning of leather the chromium iii stabilizes the leather by cross linking the collagen fibers chromium tanned leather can contain between and of chromium which is tightly bound to the proteins although the form of chromium used for tanning is not the toxic hexavalent variety there remains interest in management of chromium in the tanning industry recovery and reuse direct indirect recycling and chrome less or chrome free tanning are practiced to better manage chromium usage the high heat resistivity and high melting point makes chromite and chromium iii oxide a material for high temperature refractory applications like blast furnaces cement kilns molds for the firing of bricks and as foundry sands for the casting of metals in these applications the refractory materials are made from mixtures of chromite and magnesite the use is declining because of the environmental regulations due to the possibility of the formation of chromium vi several chromium compounds are used as catalysts for processing hydrocarbons for example the phillips catalyst prepared from chromium oxides is used for the production of about half the world s polyethylene fe cr mixed oxides are employed as high temperature catalysts for the water gas shift reaction copper chromite is a useful hydrogenation catalyst chromates of metals are used in humistor uses of compounds chromium iv oxide cro is a magnetic compound its ideal shape anisotropy which imparts high coercivity and remnant magnetization made it a compound superior to fe o chromium iv oxide is used to manufacture magnetic tape used in high performance audio tape and standard audio cassettes chromium iii oxide cr o is a metal polish known as green rouge chromic acid is a powerful oxidizing agent and is a useful compound for cleaning laboratory glassware of any trace of organic compounds it is prepared by dissolving potassium dichromate in concentrated sulfuric acid which is then used to wash the apparatus sodium dichromate is sometimes used because of its higher solubility g l versus g l respectively the use of dichromate cleaning solutions is now phased out due to the high toxicity and environmental concerns modern cleaning solutions are highly effective and chromium free potassium dichromate is a chemical reagent used as a titrating agent chromates are added to drilling muds to prevent corrosion of steel under wet conditions chrome alum is chromium iii potassium sulfate and is used as a mordant i e a fixing agent for dyes in fabric and in tanning biological role the biologically beneficial effects of chromium iii are debated chromium is accepted by the u s national institutes of health as a trace element for its roles in the action of insulin a hormone that mediates the metabolism and storage of carbohydrate fat and protein the mechanism of its actions in the body however have not been defined leaving in question the essentiality of chromium in contrast hexavalent chromium cr vi or cr is highly toxic and mutagenic ingestion of chromium vi in water has been linked to stomach tumors and it may also cause allergic contact dermatitis acd chromium deficiency involving a lack of cr iii in the body or perhaps some complex of it such as glucose tolerance factor is controversial some studies suggest that the biologically active form of chromium iii is transported in the body via an oligopeptide called low molecular weight chromium binding substance lmwcr which might play a role in the insulin signaling pathway the chromium content of common foods is generally low micrograms per serving the chromium content of food varies widely due to differences in soil mineral content growing season plant cultivar and contamination during processing chromium and nickel leach into food cooked in stainless steel with the effect being largest when the cookware is new acidic foods that are cooked for many hours also exacerbate this effect dietary recommendations there is disagreement on chromium s status as an essential nutrient governmental departments from australia new zealand india japan and the united states consider chromium essential while the european food safety authority efsa of the european union does not the u s national academy of medicine

the united states and the european union disagree labeling for u s food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount of the substance in a serving is expressed as a percent of the daily value dv for chromium labeling purposes of the daily value was g as of may the percentage of daily value was revised to g to bring the chromium intake into a consensus with the official recommended dietary allowance a table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at reference daily intake food sources food composition databases such as those maintained by the u s department of agriculture do not contain information on the chromium content of foods a wide variety of animal and vegetable foods contain chromium content per serving is influenced by the chromium content of the soil in which the plants are grown by foodstuffs fed to animals and by processing methods as chromium is leached into foods if processed or cooked in stainless steel equipment one diet analysis study conducted in mexico reported an average daily chromium intake of micrograms an estimated of adults in the united states consume multi vitamin mineral dietary supplements which often contain to micrograms of chromium supplementation chromium is an ingredient in total parenteral nutrition tpn because deficiency can occur after months of intravenous feeding with chromium free tpn it is also added to nutritional products for preterm infants although the mechanism of action in biological roles for chromium is unclear in the united states chromium containing products are sold as non prescription dietary supplements in amounts ranging from to g lower amounts of chromium are also often incorporated into multi vitamin mineral supplements consumed by an estimated of adults in the united states chemical compounds used in dietary supplements include chromium chloride chromium citrate chromium iii picolinate chromium iii polynicotinate and other chemical compositions the benefit of supplements has not been proven approved and disapproved health claims in the u s food and drug administration had approved a qualified health claim for chromium picolinate with a requirement for very specific label wording one small study suggests that chromium picolinate may reduce the risk of insulin resistance and therefore possibly may reduce the risk of type diabetes fda concludes however that the existence of such a relationship between chromium picolinate and either insulin resistance or type diabetes is highly uncertain at the same time in answer to other parts of the petition the fda rejected claims for chromium picolinate and cardiovascular disease retinopathy or kidney disease caused by abnormally high blood sugar levels in chromium iii picolinate was approved by health canada to be used in dietary supplements approved labeling statements include a factor in the maintenance of good health provides support for healthy glucose metabolism helps the body to metabolize carbohydrates and helps the body to metabolize fats the european food safety authority efsa approved claims in that chromium contributed to normal macronutrient metabolism and maintenance of normal blood glucose concentration but rejected claims for maintenance or achievement of a normal body weight or reduction of tiredness or fatigue given the evidence for chromium deficiency causing problems with glucose management in the context of intravenous nutrition products formulated without chromium research interest turned to whether chromium supplementation would benefit people who have type diabetes but are not chromium deficient looking at the results from four meta analyses one reported a statistically significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose levels fpg and a non significant trend in lower hemoglobin a c a second reported the same a third reported significant decreases for both measures while a fourth reported no benefit for either a review published in listed randomized clinical trials that were included in one or more of six meta analyses it concluded that whereas there may be modest decreases in fpg and or hba c that achieve statistical significance in some of these meta analyses few of the trials achieved decreases large enough to be expected to be relevant to clinical outcome two systematic reviews looked at chromium supplements as a mean of managing body weight in overweight and obese people one limited to chromium picolinate a popular supplement ingredient reported a statistically significant kg lb weight loss in trials longer than weeks the other included all chromium compounds and reported a statistically significant kg lb weight change change in percent body fat did not reach statistical significance authors of both reviews considered the clinical relevance of this modest weight loss as uncertain unreliable the european food safety authority reviewed the literature and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support a claim chromium is promoted as a sports performance dietary supplement based on the theory that it potentiates insulin activity with anticipated results of increased muscle mass and faster recovery of glycogen storage during post exercise recovery a review of clinical trials reported that chromium supplementation did not improve exercise performance or increase muscle strength the international olympic committee reviewed dietary supplements for high performance athletes in and concluded there was no need to increase chromium intake for athletes nor support for claims of losing body fat fresh water fish chromium is naturally present in the environment in trace amounts but industrial use in rubber and stainless steel manufacturing chrome plating dyes for textiles tanneries and other uses contaminates aquatic systems in bangladesh rivers in or downstream from industrialized areas exhibit heavy metal contamination irrigation water standards for chromium are mg l but some rivers are more than five times that amount the standard for fish for human consumption is less than mg kg but many tested samples were more than five times that amount chromium especially hexavalent chromium is highly toxic to fish because it is easily absorbed across the gills readily enters blood circulation crosses cell membranes and bioconcentrates up the food chain in contrast the toxicity of trivalent chromium is very low attributed to poor membrane permeability and little biomagnification acute and chronic exposure to chromium vi affects fish behavior physiology reproduction and survival hyperactivity and erratic swimming have been reported in contaminated environments egg hatching and fingerling survival are affected in adult fish there are reports of histopathological damage to liver kidney muscle intestines and gills mechanisms include mutagenic gene damage and disruptions of enzyme functions there is evidence that fish may not require chromium but benefit from a measured amount in diet in one study juvenile fish gained weight on a zero chromium diet but the addition of g of chromium in the form of chromium chloride or other supplement types per kilogram of food dry weight increased weight gain at g kg the weight gain was no better than with the zero chromium diet and there were increased dna strand breaks precautions water insoluble chromium iii compounds and chromium metal are not considered a health hazard while the toxicity and carcinogenic properties of chromium vi have been known for a long time because of the specific transport mechanisms only limited amounts of chromium iii enter the cells acute oral toxicity ranges between and mg kg a review suggested that moderate uptake of chromium iii through dietary supplements poses no genetic toxic risk in the us the occupational safety and health administration osha has designated an air permissible exposure limit pel in the workplace as a time weighted average twa of mg m the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit rel of mg m time weighted average the idlh immediately dangerous to life and health value is mg m chromium vi toxicity the acute oral toxicity for chromium vi ranges between and mg kg in the body chromium vi is reduced by several mechanisms to chromium iii already in the blood before it enters the cells the chromium iii is excreted from the body whereas the chromate ion is transferred into the cell by a transport mechanism by which also sulfate and phosphate ions enter the cell the acute toxicity of chromium vi is due to its strong oxidant properties after it reaches the blood stream it damages the kidneys the liver and blood cells through oxidation reactions hemolysis renal and liver failure result aggressive dialysis can be therapeutic the carcinogenity of chromate dust has been known for a long time and in the first publication described the elevated cancer risk of workers in a chromate dye company three mechanisms have been proposed to describe the genotoxicity of chromium vi the first mechanism includes highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and other reactive radicals which are by products of the reduction of chromium vi to chromium iii the second process includes the direct binding of chromium v produced by reduction in the cell and chromium iv compounds to the dna the last mechanism attributed the genotoxicity to the binding to the dna of the end product of the chromium iii reduction chromium salts chromates are also the cause of allergic reactions in some people chromates are often used to manufacture amongst other things leather products paints cement mortar and anti corrosives contact with products containing chromates can lead to allergic contact dermatitis and irritant dermatitis resulting in ulceration of the skin sometimes referred to as chrome ulcers this condition is often found in workers that have been exposed to strong chromate solutions in electroplating tanning and chrome producing manufacturers environmental issues because chromium compounds were used in dyes paints and leather tanning compounds these compounds are often found in soil and groundwater at active and abandoned industrial sites needing environmental cleanup and remediation primer paint containing hexavalent chromium is still widely used for aerospace and automobile refinishing applications in the environmental working group studied the drinking water in american cities in the first nationwide study the study found measurable hexavalent chromium in the tap water of of the cities sampled with norman oklahoma at the top of list cities had levels that exceeded california s proposed limit the more toxic hexavalent chromium form can be reduced to the less soluble trivalent oxidation state in soils by organic matter ferrous iron sulfides and other reducing agents with the rates of such reduction being faster under more acidic conditions than under more alkaline ones in contrast trivalent chromium can be oxidized to hexavalent chromium in soils by manganese oxides such as mn iii and mn iv compounds since the solubility and toxicity of chromium vi are greater that those of chromium iii the oxidation reduction conversions between the two oxidation states have implications for movement and bioavailability of chromium in soils groundwater and plants ,24
Manganese,Mn,manganese is a chemical element with the symbol mn and atomic number it is a hard brittle silvery metal often found in minerals in combination with iron manganese is a transition metal with a multifaceted array of industrial alloy uses particularly in stainless steels it improves strength workability and resistance to wear manganese oxide is used as an oxidising agent as a rubber additive and in glass making fertilisers and ceramics manganese sulfate can be used as a fungicide manganese is also an essential human dietary element important in macronutrient metabolism bone formation and free radical defense systems it is a critical component in dozens of proteins and enzymes it is found mostly in the bones but also the liver kidneys and brain in the human brain the manganese is bound to manganese metalloproteins most notably glutamine synthetase in astrocytes manganese was first isolated in it is familiar in the laboratory in the form of the deep violet salt potassium permanganate it occurs at the active sites in some enzymes of particular interest is the use of a mn o cluster the oxygen evolving complex in the production of oxygen by plants characteristics physical properties manganese is a silvery gray metal that resembles iron it is hard and very brittle difficult to fuse but easy to oxidize manganese metal and its common ions are paramagnetic manganese tarnishes slowly in air and oxidizes rusts like iron in water containing dissolved oxygen isotopes naturally occurring manganese is composed of one stable isotope mn several radioisotopes have been isolated and described ranging in atomic weight from u mn to u mn the most stable are mn with a half life of million years mn with a half life of days and mn with a half life of days all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives of less than three hours and the majority of less than one minute the primary decay mode in isotopes lighter than the most abundant stable isotope mn is electron capture and the primary mode in heavier isotopes is beta decay manganese also has three meta states manganese is part of the iron group of elements which are thought to be synthesized in large stars shortly before the supernova explosion mn decays to cr with a half life of million years because of its relatively short half life mn is relatively rare produced by cosmic rays impact on iron manganese isotopic contents are typically combined with chromium isotopic contents and have found application in isotope geology and radiometric dating mn cr isotopic ratios reinforce the evidence from al and pd for the early history of the solar system variations in cr cr and mn cr ratios from several meteorites suggest an initial mn mn ratio which indicate that mn cr isotopic composition must result from in situ decay of mn in differentiated planetary bodies hence mn provides additional evidence for nucleosynthetic processes immediately before coalescence of the solar system oxidation states the most common oxidation states of manganese are and though all oxidation states from to have been observed mn often competes with mg in biological systems with the ion also being very similar in its properties to ca and zn manganese compounds where manganese is in oxidation state which are mostly restricted to the unstable oxide mn o compounds of the intensely purple permanganate anion mno and a few oxyhalides mno f and mno cl are powerful oxidizing agents compounds with oxidation states blue and green are strong oxidizing agents and are vulnerable to disproportionation the most stable oxidation state for manganese is which has a pale pink color and many manganese ii compounds are known such as manganese ii sulfate mnso and manganese ii chloride mncl this oxidation state is also seen in the mineral rhodochrosite manganese ii carbonate manganese ii most commonly exists with a high spin s ground state because of the high pairing energy for manganese ii however there are a few examples of low spin s manganese ii there are no spin allowed d d transitions in manganese ii explaining why manganese ii compounds are typically pale to colorless the oxidation state is known in compounds like manganese iii acetate but these are quite powerful oxidizing agents and also prone to disproportionation in solution forming manganese ii and manganese iv solid compounds of manganese iii are characterized by its strong purple red color and a preference for distorted octahedral coordination resulting from the jahn teller effect the oxidation state can be produced by dissolving manganese dioxide in molten sodium nitrite manganate vi salts can be produced by dissolving mn compounds such as manganese dioxide in molten alkali while exposed to air permanganate oxidation state compounds are purple and can give glass a violet color potassium permanganate sodium permanganate and barium permanganate are all potent oxidizers potassium permanganate also called condy s crystals is a commonly used laboratory reagent because of its oxidizing properties it is used as a topical medicine for example in the treatment of fish diseases solutions of potassium permanganate were among the first stains and fixatives to be used in the preparation of biological cells and tissues for electron microscopy the rare oxidation state exists in some organomanganese compounds such as the mnc h ch co compound cited in the table above history the origin of the name manganese is complex in ancient times two black minerals were identified from the regions of the magnetes either magnesia located within modern greece or magnesia ad sipylum located within modern turkey they were both called magnes from their place of origin but were considered to differ in sex the male magnes attracted iron and was the iron ore now known as lodestone or magnetite and which probably gave us the term magnet the female magnes ore did not attract iron but was used to decolorize glass this female magnes was later called magnesia known now in modern times as pyrolusite or manganese dioxide neither this mineral nor elemental manganese is magnetic in the th century manganese dioxide was called manganesum note the two ns instead of one by glassmakers possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a magnesia nigra the black ore from magnesia alba a white ore also from magnesia also useful in glassmaking michele mercati called magnesia nigra manganesa and finally the metal isolated from it became known as manganese german mangan the name magnesia eventually was then used to refer only to the white magnesia alba magnesium oxide which provided the name magnesium for the free element when it was isolated much later several colorful oxides of manganese for example manganese dioxide are abundant in nature and have been used as pigments since the stone age the cave paintings in gargas that are to years old contain manganese pigments manganese compounds were used by egyptian and roman glassmakers either to add to or remove color from glass use as glassmakers soap continued through the middle ages until modern times and is evident in th century glass from venice because it was used in glassmaking manganese dioxide was available for experiments by alchemists the first chemists ignatius gottfried kaim and johann glauber th century discovered that manganese dioxide could be converted to permanganate a useful laboratory reagent by the mid th century the swedish chemist carl wilhelm scheele used manganese dioxide to produce chlorine first hydrochloric acid or a mixture of dilute sulfuric acid and sodium chloride was made to react with manganese dioxide and later hydrochloric acid from the leblanc process was used and the manganese dioxide was recycled by the weldon process the production of chlorine and hypochlorite bleaching agents was a large consumer of manganese ores by the mid th century carl wilhelm scheele used pyrolusite to produce chlorine scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite now known to be manganese dioxide contained a new element johan gottlieb gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in which he did by reducing the dioxide with carbon the manganese content of some iron ores used in greece led to speculations that steel produced from that ore contains additional manganese making the spartan steel exceptionally hard around the beginning of the th century manganese was used in steelmaking and several patents were granted in it was documented that iron alloyed with manganese was harder but not more brittle in british academic james couper noted an association between miners heavy exposure to manganese and a form of parkinson s disease in united states patents were granted for protecting firearms against rust and corrosion with manganese phosphate electrochemical conversion coatings and the process has seen widespread use ever since the invention of the leclanch cell in and the subsequent improvement of batteries containing manganese dioxide as cathodic depolarizer increased the demand for manganese dioxide until the development of batteries with nickel cadmium and lithium most batteries contained manganese the zinc carbon battery and the alkaline battery normally use industrially produced manganese dioxide because naturally occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities in the th century manganese dioxide was widely used as the cathodic for commercial disposable dry batteries of both the standard zinc carbon and alkaline types occurrence manganese comprises about ppm of the earth s crust the th most abundant of the crust s elements soil contains ppm of manganese with an average of ppm the atmosphere contains g m manganese occurs principally as pyrolusite mno braunite mn mn sio psilomelane ba h o mn o and to a lesser extent as rhodochrosite mnco the most important manganese ore is pyrolusite mno other economically important manganese ores usually show a close spatial relation to the iron ores such as sphalerite land based resources are large but irregularly distributed about of the known world manganese resources are in south africa other important manganese deposits are in ukraine australia india china gabon and brazil according to estimate the ocean floor has billion tons of manganese nodules attempts to find economically viable methods of harvesting manganese nodules were abandoned in the s in south africa most identified deposits are located near hotazel in the northern cape province with a estimate of billion tons in south africa produced million tons topping all other nations manganese is mainly mined in south africa australia china gabon brazil india kazakhstan ghana ukraine and malaysia production for the production of ferromanganese the manganese ore is mixed with iron ore and carbon and then reduced either in a blast furnace or in an electric arc furnace the resulting ferromanganese has a manganese content of to pure manganese used for the production of iron free alloys is produced by leaching manganese ore with sulfuric acid and a subsequent electrowinning process a more progressive extraction process involves directly reducing a low grade manganese ore in a heap leach this is done by percolating natural gas through the bottom of the heap the natural gas provides the heat needs to be at least c and the reducing agent carbon monoxide this reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide mno which is a leachable form the ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between and m increasing the surface area to aid leaching the ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron fe in a ratio the iron reacts with the manganese dioxide mno to form iron hydroxide feo oh and elemental manganese mn this process yields approximately recovery of the manganese for further purification the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility in the cia s project azorian through billionaire howard hughes commissioned the ship hughes glomar explorer with the cover story of harvesting manganese nodules from the sea floor that triggered a rush of activity to collect manganese nodules which was not actually practical the real mission of hughes glomar explorer was to raise a sunken soviet submarine the k with the goal of retrieving soviet code books an abundant resource of manganese in the form of mn nodules found on the ocean floor these nodules which are composed of manganese are located along the ocean floor and the potential impact of mining these nodules is being researched physical chemical and biological environmental impacts can occur due to this nodule mining disturbing the seafloor and causing sediment plumes to form this suspension includes metals and inorganic nutrients which can lead to contamination of the near bottom waters from dissolved toxic compounds mn nodules are also the grazing grounds living space and protection for endo and epifaunal systems when theses nodules are removed these systems are directly affected overall this can cause species to leave the area or completely die off prior to the commencement of the mining itself research is being conducted by united nations affiliated bodies and state sponsored companies in an attempt to fully understand environmental impacts in the hopes of mitigating these impacts oceanic environment many trace elements in the ocean come from metal rich hydrothermal particles from hydrothermal vents dissolved manganese dmn is found throughout the world s oceans of which originates from hydrothermal vents particulate mn develops in buoyant plumes over an active vent source while the dmn behaves conservatively mn concentrations vary between the water columns of the ocean at the surface dmn is elevated due to input from external sources such as rivers dust and shelf sediments coastal sediments normally have lower mn concentrations but can increase due to anthropogenic discharges from industries such as mining and steel manufacturing which enter the ocean from river inputs surface dmn concentrations can also be elevated biologically through photosynthesis and physically from coastal upwelling and wind driven surface currents internal cycling such as photo reduction from uv radiation can also elevate levels by speeding up the dissolution of mn oxides and oxidative scavenging preventing mn from sinking to deeper waters elevated levels at mid depths can occur near mid ocean ridges and hydrothermal vents the hydrothermal vents release dmn enriched fluid into the water the dmn can then travel up to km due to the microbial capsules present preventing exchange with particles lowing the sinking rates dissolved mn concentrations are even higher when oxygen levels are low overall dmn concentrations are normally higher in coastal regions and decrease when moving offshore soils manganese occurs in soils in three oxidation states the divalent cation mn and as brownish black oxides and hydroxides containing mn iii iv such as mnooh and mno soil ph and oxidation reduction conditions affect which of these three forms of mn is dominant in a given soil at ph values less than or under anaerobic conditions mn ii dominates while under more alkaline and aerobic conditions mn iii iv oxides and hydroxides predominate these effects of soil acidity and aeration state on the form of mn can be modified or controlled by microbial activity microbial respiration can cause both the oxidation of mn to the oxides and it can cause reduction of the oxides to the divalent cation the mn iii iv oxides exist as brownish black stains and small nodules on sand silt and clay particles these surface coatings on other soil particles have high surface area and carry negative charge the charged sites can adsorb and retain various cations especially heavy metals e g cr cu zn and pb in addition the oxides can adsorb organic acids and other compounds the adsorption of the metals and organic compounds can then cause them to be oxidized while the mn iii iv oxides are reduced to mn e g cr to cr vi and colorless hydroquinone to tea colored quinone polymers applications manganese has no satisfactory substitute in its major applications in metallurgy in minor applications e g manganese phosphating zinc and sometimes vanadium are viable substitutes steel manganese is essential to iron and steel production by virtue of its sulfur fixing deoxidizing and alloying properties as first recognized by the british metallurgist robert forester mushet who in introduced the element in the form of spiegeleisen into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen sulfur and phosphorus in order to improve its malleability steelmaking including its ironmaking component has accounted for most manganese demand presently in the range of to of the total demand manganese is a key component of low cost stainless steel often ferromanganese usually about manganese is the intermediate in modern processes small amounts of manganese improve the workability of steel at high temperatures by forming a high melting sulfide and preventing the formation of a liquid iron sulfide at the grain boundaries if the manganese content reaches the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature the embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at steel containing to of manganese has a high tensile strength of up to mpa steel with manganese was discovered in by robert hadfield and is still known as hadfield steel mangalloy it was used for british military steel helmets and later by the u s military aluminium alloys the second largest application for manganese is in aluminium alloys aluminium with roughly manganese has increased resistance to corrosion through grains that absorb impurities which would lead to galvanic corrosion the corrosion resistant aluminium alloys and to manganese are used for most beverage cans before more than million tonnes of those alloys were used at manganese this consumed tonnes of manganese other uses methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl is used as an additive in unleaded gasoline to boost octane rating and reduce engine knocking the manganese in this unusual organometallic compound is in the oxidation state manganese iv oxide manganese dioxide mno is used as a reagent in organic chemistry for the oxidation of benzylic alcohols where the hydroxyl group is adjacent to an aromatic ring manganese dioxide has been used since antiquity to oxidize and neutralize the greenish tinge in glass from trace amounts of iron contamination mno is also used in the manufacture of oxygen and chlorine and in drying black paints in some preparations it is a brown pigment for paint and is a constituent of natural umber tetravalent manganese is used as an activator in red emitting phosphors while many compounds are known which show luminescence the majority are not used in commercial application due to low efficiency or deep red emission however several mn activated fluorides were reported as potential red emitting phosphors for warm white leds but to this day only k sif mn is commercially available for use in warm white leds batteries manganese iv oxide was used in the original type of dry cell battery as an electron acceptor from zinc and is the blackish material in carbon zinc type flashlight cells the manganese dioxide is reduced to the manganese oxide hydroxide mno oh during discharging preventing the formation of hydrogen at the anode of the battery mno h o e mno oh oh the same material also functions in newer alkaline batteries usually battery cells which use the same basic reaction but a different electrolyte mixture in more than tons of manganese dioxide was used for this purpose resistors copper alloys of manganese such as manganin are commonly found in metal element shunt resistors used for measuring relatively large amounts of current these alloys have very low temperature coefficient of resistance and are resistant to sulfur this makes the alloys particularly useful in harsh automotive and industrial environments minting the metal is occasionally used in coins until the only united states coin to use manganese was the wartime nickel from to an alloy of copper and nickel was traditionally used for the production of nickel coins however because of shortage of nickel metal during the war it was substituted by more available silver and manganese thus resulting in an alloy of copper silver and manganese since dollar coins for example the sacagawea dollar and the presidential coins are made from a brass containing of manganese with a pure copper core in both cases of nickel and dollar the use of manganese in the coin was to duplicate the electromagnetic properties of a previous identically sized and valued coin in the mechanisms of vending machines in the case of the later u s dollar coins the manganese alloy was intended to duplicate the properties of the copper nickel alloy used in the previous susan b anthony dollar ceramic coloring manganese compounds have been used as pigments and for the coloring of ceramics and glass the brown color of ceramic is sometimes the result of manganese compounds in the glass industry manganese compounds are used for two effects manganese iii reacts with iron ii to reduce strong green color in glass by forming less colored iron iii and slightly pink manganese ii compensating for the residual color of the iron iii larger quantities of manganese are used to produce pink colored glass in professor mas subramanian and associates at oregon state university discovered that manganese can be combined with yttrium and indium to form an intensely blue non toxic inert fade resistant pigment yinmn blue the first new blue pigment discovered in years biological role biochemistry the classes of enzymes that have manganese cofactors include oxidoreductases transferases hydrolases lyases isomerases and ligases other enzymes containing manganese are arginase and mn containing superoxide dismutase mn sod also the enzyme class of reverse transcriptases of many retroviruses though not lentiviruses such as hiv contains manganese manganese containing polypeptides are the diphtheria toxin lectins and integrins biological role in humans manganese is an essential human dietary element it is present as a coenzyme in several biological processes which include macronutrient metabolism bone formation and free radical defense systems it is a critical component in dozens of proteins and enzymes the human body contains about mg of manganese mostly in the bones the soft tissue remainder is concentrated in the liver and kidneys in the human brain the manganese is bound to manganese metalloproteins most notably glutamine synthetase in astrocytes nutrition dietary recommendations the u s institute of medicine iom updated estimated average requirements ears and recommended dietary allowances rdas for minerals in for manganese there was not sufficient information to set ears and rdas so needs are described as estimates for adequate intakes ais as for safety the iom sets tolerable upper intake

ul for u s food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of daily value dv for manganese labeling purposes of the daily value was mg but as of may it was revised to mg to bring it into agreement with the rda a table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at reference daily intake toxicity excessive exposure or intake may lead to a condition known as manganism a neurodegenerative disorder that causes dopaminergic neuronal death and symptoms similar to parkinson s disease deficiency manganese deficiency in humans results in a number of medical problems many common vitamin and mineral supplement products fail to include manganese in their compositions relatively high dietary intake of other minerals such as iron magnesium and calcium may inhibit the proper intake of manganese a deficiency of manganese causes skeletal deformation in animals and inhibits the production of collagen in wound healing toxicity in marine life many enzymatic systems need mn to function but in high levels mn can become toxic one environmental reason mn levels can increase in seawater is when hypoxic periods occur since there have been reports of mn accumulation in marine organisms including fish crustaceans mollusks and echinoderms specific tissues are targets in different species including the gills brain blood kidney and liver hepatopancreas physiological effects have been reported in these species mn can affect the renewal of immunocytes and their functionality such as phagocytosis and activation of pro phenoloxidase suppressing the organisms immune systems this causes the organisms to be more susceptible to infections as climate change occurs pathogen distributions increase and in order for organisms to survive and defend themselves against these pathogens they need a healthy strong immune system if their systems are compromised from high mn levels they will not be able to fight off these pathogens and die biological role in bacteria mn sod is the type of sod present in eukaryotic mitochondria and also in most bacteria this fact is in keeping with the bacterial origin theory of mitochondria the mn sod enzyme is probably one of the most ancient for nearly all organisms living in the presence of oxygen use it to deal with the toxic effects of superoxide o formed from the electron reduction of dioxygen the exceptions which are all bacteria include lactobacillus plantarum and related lactobacilli which use a different nonenzymatic mechanism with manganese mn ions complexed with polyphosphate suggesting a path of evolution for this function in aerobic life biological role in plants manganese is also important in photosynthetic oxygen evolution in chloroplasts in plants the oxygen evolving complex oec is a part of photosystem ii contained in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts it is responsible for the terminal photooxidation of water during the light reactions of photosynthesis and has a metalloenzyme core containing four atoms of manganese to fulfill this requirement most broad spectrum plant fertilizers contain manganese precautions manganese compounds are less toxic than those of other widespread metals such as nickel and copper however exposure to manganese dusts and fumes should not exceed the ceiling value of mg m even for short periods because of its toxicity level manganese poisoning has been linked to impaired motor skills and cognitive disorders permanganate exhibits a higher toxicity than manganese ii compounds the fatal dose is about g and several fatal intoxications have occurred the strong oxidative effect leads to necrosis of the mucous membrane for example the esophagus is affected if the permanganate is swallowed only a limited amount is absorbed by the intestines but this small amount shows severe effects on the kidneys and on the liver manganese exposure in united states is regulated by the occupational safety and health administration osha people can be exposed to manganese in the workplace by breathing it in or swallowing it osha has set the legal limit permissible exposure limit for manganese exposure in the workplace as mg m over an hour workday the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit rel of mg m over an hour workday and a short term limit of mg m at levels of mg m manganese is immediately dangerous to life and health generally exposure to ambient mn air concentrations in excess of g mn m can lead to mn induced symptoms increased ferroportin protein expression in human embryonic kidney hek cells is associated with decreased intracellular mn concentration and attenuated cytotoxicity characterized by the reversal of mn reduced glutamate uptake and diminished lactate dehydrogenase leakage environmental health concerns in drinking water waterborne manganese has a greater bioavailability than dietary manganese according to results from a study higher levels of exposure to manganese in drinking water are associated with increased intellectual impairment and reduced intelligence quotients in school age children it is hypothesized that long term exposure due to inhaling the naturally occurring manganese in shower water puts up to million americans at risk however data indicates that the human body can recover from certain adverse effects of overexposure to manganese if the exposure is stopped and the body can clear the excess in gasoline methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl mmt is a gasoline additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines to improve the octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates it reduces engine knock agent through the action of the carbonyl groups fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides which damage exhaust valves compared to levels of manganese in air have dropped in tobacco smoke the tobacco plant readily absorbs and accumulates heavy metals such as manganese from the surrounding soil into its leaves these are subsequently inhaled during tobacco smoking while manganese is a constituent of tobacco smoke studies have largely concluded that concentrations are not hazardous for human health role in neurological disorders manganism manganese overexposure is most frequently associated with manganism a rare neurological disorder associated with excessive manganese ingestion or inhalation historically persons employed in the production or processing of manganese alloys have been at risk for developing manganism however current health and safety regulations protect workers in developed nations the disorder was first described in by british academic john couper who studied two patients who were m manganism is a biphasic disorder in its early stages an intoxicated person may experience depression mood swings compulsive behaviors and psychosis early neurological symptoms give way to late stage manganism which resembles parkinson s disease symptoms include weakness monotone and slowed speech an expressionless face tremor forward leaning gait inability to walk backwards without falling rigidity and general problems with dexterity gait and balance unlike parkinson s disease manganism is not associated with loss of the sense of smell and patients are typically unresponsive to treatment with l dopa symptoms of late stage manganism become more severe over time even if the source of exposure is removed and brain manganese levels return to normal chronic manganese exposure has been shown to produce a parkinsonism like illness characterized by movement abnormalities this condition is not responsive to typical therapies used in the treatment of pd suggesting an alternative pathway than the typical dopaminergic loss within the substantia nigra manganese may accumulate in the basal ganglia leading to the abnormal movements a mutation of the slc a gene a manganese efflux transporter necessary for decreasing intracellular mn has been linked with the development of this parkinsonism like disease the lewy bodies typical to pd are not seen in mn induced parkinsonism animal experiments have given the opportunity to examine the consequences of manganese overexposure under controlled conditions in non aggressive rats manganese induces mouse killing behavior childhood developmental disorders several recent studies attempt to examine the effects of chronic low dose manganese overexposure on child development the earliest study was conducted in the chinese province of shanxi drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained g mn l although mn concentrations at or below g mn l were considered safe at the time of the study by the us epa and g mn l by the world health organization the children sampled between and years of age from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity short term memory and visual

Iron,Fe,iron is a chemical element with symbol fe from latin ferrum and atomic number it is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group of the periodic table it is by mass the most common element on earth right in front of oxygen and respectively forming much of earth s outer and inner core it is the fourth most common element in the earth s crust in its metallic state iron is rare in the earth s crust limited mainly to deposition by meteorites iron ores by contrast are among the most abundant in the earth s crust although extracting usable metal from them requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching c f or higher about c f higher than that required to smelt copper humans started to master that process in eurasia during the nd millennium bce and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys in some regions only around bce that event is considered the transition from the bronze age to the iron age in the modern world iron alloys such as steel stainless steel cast iron and special steels are by far the most common industrial metals because of their mechanical properties and low cost the iron and steel industry is thus very important economically and iron is the cheapest metal with a price of a few dollars per kilogram or per pound see metal uses pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are mirror like silvery gray however iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to give brown to black hydrated iron oxides commonly known as rust unlike the oxides of some other metals that form passivating layers rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off exposing more fresh surfaces for corrosion although iron readily reacts high purity iron called electrolytic iron has better corrosion resistance the body of an adult human contains about grams body weight of iron mostly in hemoglobin and myoglobin these two proteins play essential roles in vertebrate metabolism respectively oxygen transport by blood and oxygen storage in muscles to maintain the necessary levels human iron metabolism requires a minimum of iron in the diet iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals chemically the most common oxidation states of iron are iron ii and iron iii iron shares many properties of other transition metals including the other group elements ruthenium and osmium iron forms compounds in a wide range of oxidation states to iron also forms many coordination compounds some of them such as ferrocene ferrioxalate and prussian blue have substantial industrial medical or research applications characteristics allotropes at least four allotropes of iron differing atom arrangements in the solid are known conventionally denoted and the first three forms are observed at ordinary pressures as molten iron cools past its freezing point of c it crystallizes into its allotrope which has a body centered cubic bcc crystal structure as it cools further to c it changes to its iron allotrope a face centered cubic fcc crystal structure or austenite at c and below the crystal structure again becomes the bcc iron allotrope the physical properties of iron at very high pressures and temperatures have also been studied extensively because of their relevance to theories about the cores of the earth and other planets above approximately gpa and temperatures of a few hundred kelvin or less iron changes into another hexagonal close packed hcp structure which is also known as iron the higher temperature phase also changes into iron but does so at higher pressure some controversial experimental evidence exists for a stable phase at pressures above gpa and temperatures of at least k it is supposed to have an orthorhombic or a double hcp structure confusingly the term iron is sometimes also used to refer to iron above its curie point when it changes from being ferromagnetic to paramagnetic even though its crystal structure has not changed the inner core of the earth is generally presumed to consist of an iron nickel alloy with or structure melting and boiling points the melting and boiling points of iron along with its enthalpy of atomization are lower than those of the earlier d elements from scandium to chromium showing the lessened contribution of the d electrons to metallic bonding as they are attracted more and more into the inert core by the nucleus however they are higher than the values for the previous element manganese because that element has a half filled d sub shell and consequently its d electrons are not easily delocalized this same trend appears for ruthenium but not osmium the melting point of iron is experimentally well defined for pressures less than gpa for greater pressures published data as of still varies by tens of gigapascals and over a thousand kelvin magnetic properties below its curie point of c f k iron changes from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic the spins of the two unpaired electrons in each atom generally align with the spins of its neighbors creating an overall magnetic field this happens because the orbitals of those two electrons dz and dx y do not point toward neighboring atoms in the lattice and therefore are not involved in metallic bonding in the absence of an external source of magnetic field the atoms get spontaneously partitioned into magnetic domains about micrometers across such that the atoms in each domain have parallel spins but some domains have other orientations thus a macroscopic piece of iron will have a nearly zero overall magnetic field application of an external magnetic field causes the domains that are magnetized in the same general direction to grow at the expense of adjacent ones that point in other directions reinforcing the external field this effect is exploited in devices that need to channel magnetic fields to fulfill design function such as electrical transformers magnetic recording heads and electric motors impurities lattice defects or grain and particle boundaries can pin the domains in the new positions so that the effect persists even after the external field is removed thus turning the iron object into a permanent magnet similar behavior is exhibited by some iron compounds such as the ferrites including the mineral magnetite a crystalline form of the mixed iron ii iii oxide fe o although the atomic scale mechanism ferrimagnetism is somewhat different pieces of magnetite with natural permanent magnetization lodestones provided the earliest compasses for navigation particles of magnetite were extensively used in magnetic recording media such as core memories magnetic tapes floppies and disks until they were replaced by cobalt based materials isotopes iron has four stable isotopes fe of natural iron fe fe and fe artificial isotopes have also been created of these stable isotopes only fe has a nuclear spin the nuclide fe theoretically can undergo double electron capture to cr but the process has never been observed and only a lower limit on the half life of years has been established fe is an extinct radionuclide of long half life million years it is not found on earth but its ultimate decay product is its granddaughter the stable nuclide ni much of the past work on isotopic composition of iron has focused on the nucleosynthesis of fe through studies of meteorites and ore formation in the last decade advances in mass spectrometry have allowed the detection and quantification of minute naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the stable isotopes of iron much of this work is driven by the earth and planetary science communities although applications to biological and industrial systems are emerging in phases of the meteorites semarkona and chervony kut a correlation between the concentration of ni the granddaughter of fe and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes provided evidence for the existence of fe at the time of formation of the solar system possibly the energy released by the decay of fe along with that released by al contributed to the remelting and differentiation of asteroids after their formation billion years ago the abundance of ni present in extraterrestrial material may bring further insight into the origin and early history of the solar system the most abundant iron isotope fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists because it represents the most common endpoint of nucleosynthesis since ni alpha particles is easily produced from lighter nuclei in the alpha process in nuclear reactions in supernovae see silicon burning process it is the endpoint of fusion chains inside extremely massive stars since addition of another alpha particle resulting in zn requires a great deal more energy this ni which has a half life of about days is created in quantity in these stars but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the supernova remnant gas cloud first to radioactive co and then to stable fe as such iron is the most abundant element in the core of red giants and is the most abundant metal in iron meteorites and in the dense metal cores of planets such as earth it is also very common in the universe relative to other stable metals of approximately the same atomic weight iron is the sixth most abundant element in the universe and the most common refractory element although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing ni which has a marginally higher binding energy than fe conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process element production in supernovas and distribution on earth greatly favor iron over nickel and in any case fe still has a lower mass per nucleon than ni due to its higher fraction of lighter protons hence elements heavier than iron require a supernova for their formation involving rapid neutron capture by starting fe nuclei in the far future of the universe assuming that proton decay does not occur cold fusion occurring via quantum tunnelling would cause the light nuclei in ordinary matter to fuse into fe nuclei fission and alpha particle emission would then make heavy nuclei decay into iron converting all stellar mass objects to cold spheres of pure iron origin and occurrence in nature cosmogenesis iron s abundance in rocky planets like earth is due to its abundant production during the runaway fusion and explosion of type ia supernovae which scatters the iron into space metallic iron metallic or native iron is rarely found on the surface of the earth because it tends to oxidize however both the earth s inner and outer core that account for of the mass of the whole earth are believed to consist largely of an iron alloy possibly with nickel electric currents in the liquid outer core are believed to be the origin of the earth s magnetic field the other terrestrial planets mercury venus and mars as well as the moon are believed to have a metallic core consisting mostly of iron the m type asteroids are also believed to be partly or mostly made of metallic iron alloy the rare iron meteorites are the main form of natural metallic iron on the earth s surface items made of cold worked meteoritic iron have been found in various archaeological sites dating from a time when iron smelting had not yet been developed and the inuit in greenland have been reported to use iron from the cape york meteorite for tools and hunting weapons about in meteorites consist of the unique iron nickel minerals taenite iron and kamacite iron native iron is also rarely found in basalts that have formed from magmas that have come into contact with carbon rich sedimentary rocks which have reduced the oxygen fugacity sufficiently for iron to crystallize this is known as telluric iron and is described from a few localities such as disko island in west greenland yakutia in russia and b hl in germany mantle minerals ferropericlase mg fe o a solid solution of periclase mgo and w stite feo makes up about of the volume of the lower mantle of the earth which makes it the second most abundant mineral phase in that region after silicate perovskite mg fe sio it also is the major host for iron in the lower mantle at the bottom of the transition zone of the mantle the reaction mg fe sio mg fe sio mg fe o transforms olivine into a mixture of silicate perovskite and ferropericlase and vice versa in the literature this mineral phase of the lower mantle is also often called magnesiow stite silicate perovskite may form up to of the lower mantle and the magnesium iron form mg fe sio is considered to be the most abundant mineral in the earth making up of its volume earth s crust while iron is the most abundant element on earth most of this iron is concentrated in the inner and outer cores the fraction of iron that is in earth s crust only amounts to about of the overall mass of the crust and is thus only the fourth most abundant element in that layer after oxygen silicon and aluminium most of the iron in the crust is combined with various other elements to form many iron minerals an important class is the iron oxide minerals such as hematite fe o magnetite fe o and siderite feco which are the major ores of iron many igneous rocks also contain the sulfide minerals pyrrhotite and pentlandite during weathering iron tends to leach from sulfide deposits as the sulfate and from silicate deposits as the bicarbonate both of these are oxidized in aqueous solution and precipitate in even mildly elevated ph as iron iii oxide large deposits of iron are banded iron formations a type of rock consisting of repeated thin layers of iron oxides alternating with bands of iron poor shale and chert the banded iron formations were laid down in the time between million years ago and million years ago materials containing finely ground iron iii oxides or oxide hydroxides such as ochre have been used as yellow red and brown pigments since pre historical times they contribute as well to the color of various rocks and clays including entire geological formations like the painted hills in oregon and the buntsandstein colored sandstone british bunter through eisensandstein a jurassic iron sandstone e g from donzdorf in germany and bath stone in the uk iron compounds are responsible for the yellowish color of many historical buildings and sculptures the proverbial red color of the surface of mars is derived from an iron oxide rich regolith significant amounts of iron occur in the iron sulfide mineral pyrite fes but it is difficult to extract iron from it and it is therefore not exploited in fact iron is so common that production generally focuses only on ores with very high quantities of it according to the international resource panel s metal stocks in society report the global stock of iron in use in society is kg per capita more developed countries differ in this respect from less developed countries vs kg per capita oceans ocean science demonstrated the role of the iron in the ancient seas in both marine biota and climate chemistry and compounds iron shows the characteristic chemical properties of the transition metals namely the ability to form variable oxidation states differing by steps of one and a very large coordination and organometallic chemistry indeed it was the discovery of an iron compound ferrocene that revolutionalized the latter field in the s iron is sometimes considered as a prototype for the entire block of transition metals due to its abundance and the immense role it has played in the technological progress of humanity its electrons are arranged in the configuration ar d s of which the d and s electrons are relatively close in energy and thus it can lose a variable number of electrons and there is no clear point where further ionization becomes unprofitable iron forms compounds mainly in the oxidation states iron ii ferrous and iron iii ferric iron also occurs in higher oxidation states e g the purple potassium ferrate k feo which contains iron in its oxidation state although iron viii oxide feo has been claimed the report could not be reproduced and such a species from the removal of all electrons of the element beyond the preceding inert gas configuration at least with iron in its oxidation state has been found to be improbable computationally however one form of anionic feo with iron in its oxidation state along with an iron v peroxo isomer has been detected by infrared spectroscopy at k after cocondensation of laser ablated fe atoms with a mixture of o ar iron iv is a common intermediate in many biochemical oxidation reactions numerous organoiron compounds contain formal oxidation states of or even the oxidation states and other bonding properties are often assessed using the technique of m ssbauer spectroscopy many mixed valence compounds contain both iron ii and iron iii centers such as magnetite and prussian blue fe fe cn the latter is used as the traditional blue in blueprints iron is the first of the transition metals that cannot reach its group oxidation state of although its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium can with ruthenium having more difficulty than osmium ruthenium exhibits an aqueous cationic chemistry in its low oxidation states similar to that of iron but osmium does not favoring high oxidation states in which it forms anionic complexes in the second half of the d transition series vertical similarities down the groups compete with the horizontal similarities of iron with its neighbors cobalt and nickel in the periodic table which are also ferromagnetic at room temperature and share similar chemistry as such iron cobalt and nickel are sometimes grouped together as the iron triad unlike many other metals iron does not form amalgams with mercury as a result mercury is traded in standardized pound flasks kg made of iron iron is by far the most reactive element in its group it is pyrophoric when finely divided and dissolves easily in dilute acids giving fe however it does not react with concentrated nitric acid and other oxidizing acids due to the formation of an impervious oxide layer which can nevertheless react with hydrochloric acid high purity iron called electrolytic iron is considered to be resistant to rust due to its oxide layer binary compounds oxides and hydroxides iron forms various oxide and hydroxide compounds the most common are iron ii iii oxide fe o and iron iii oxide fe o iron ii oxide also exists though it is unstable at room temperature despite their names they are actually all non stoichiometric compounds whose compositions may vary these oxides are the principal ores for the production of iron see bloomery and blast furnace they are also used in the production of ferrites useful magnetic storage media in computers and pigments the best known sulfide is iron pyrite fes also known as fool s gold owing to its golden luster it is not an iron iv compound but is actually an iron ii polysulfide containing fe and s ions in a distorted sodium chloride structure halides the binary ferrous and ferric halides are well known the ferrous halides typically arise from treating iron metal with the corresponding hydrohalic acid to give the corresponding hydrated salts fe hx fex h x f cl br i iron reacts with fluorine chlorine and bromine to give the corresponding ferric halides ferric chloride being the most common fe x fex x f cl br ferric iodide is an exception being thermodynamically unstable due to the oxidizing power of fe and the high reducing power of i i fe i fe e v ferric iodide a black solid is not stable in ordinary conditions but can be prepared through the reaction of iron pentacarbonyl with iodine and carbon monoxide in the presence of hexane and light at the temperature of c with oxygen and water excluded complexes of ferric iodide with some soft bases are known to be stable compounds solution chemistry the standard reduction potentials in acidic aqueous solution for some common iron ions are given below the red purple tetrahedral ferrate vi anion is such a strong oxidizing agent that it oxidizes nitrogen and ammonia at room temperature and even water itself in acidic or neutral solutions feo h o fe oh o the fe ion has a large simple cationic chemistry although the pale violet hexaquo ion fe h o is very readily hydrolyzed when ph increases above as follows as ph rises above the above yellow hydrolyzed species form and as it rises above reddish brown hydrous iron iii oxide precipitates out of solution although fe has a d configuration its absorption spectrum is not like that of mn with its weak spin forbidden d d bands because fe has higher positive charge and is more polarizing lowering the energy of its ligand to metal charge transfer absorptions thus all the above complexes are rather strongly colored with the single exception of the hexaquo ion and even that has a spectrum dominated by charge transfer in the near ultraviolet region on the other hand the pale green iron ii hexaquo ion fe h o does not undergo appreciable hydrolysis carbon dioxide is not evolved when carbonate anions are added which instead results in white iron ii carbonate being precipitated out in excess carbon dioxide this forms the slightly soluble bicarbonate which occurs commonly in groundwater but it oxidises quickly in air to form iron iii oxide that accounts for the brown deposits present in a sizeable number of streams coordination compounds due to its electronic structure iron has a very large coordination and organometallic chemistry many coordination compounds of iron are known a typical six coordinate anion is hexachloroferrate iii fecl found in the mixed salt tetrakis methylammonium hexachloroferrate iii chloride complexes with multiple bidentate ligands have geometric isomers for example the trans chlorohydridobis bis diphenylphosphino ethane iron ii complex is used as a starting material for compounds with the fe dppe moiety the ferrioxalate ion with three oxalate ligands shown at right displays helical chirality with its two non superposable geometries labelled lambda for the left handed screw axis and delta for the right handed screw axis in line with iupac conventions potassium ferrioxalate is used in chemical actinometry and along with its sodium salt undergoes photoreduction applied in old style photographic processes the dihydrate of iron ii oxalate has a polymeric structure with co planar oxalate ions bridging between iron centres with the water of crystallisation located forming the caps of each octahedron as illustrated below iron iii complexes are quite similar to those of chromium iii with the exception of iron iii s preference for o donor instead of n donor ligands the latter tend to be rather more unstable than iron ii complexes and often dissociate in water many fe o complexes show intense colors and are used as tests for phenols or enols for example in the ferric chloride test used to determine the presence of phenols iron iii chloride reacts with a phenol to form a deep violet complex aroh fecl fe oar hcl ar aryl among the halide and pseudohalide complexes fluoro complexes of iron iii are the most stable with the colorless fef h o being the most stable in aqueous solution chloro complexes are less stable and favor tetrahedral coordination as in fecl febr and fei are reduced easily to iron ii thiocyanate is a common test for the presence of iron iii as it forms the blood red fe scn h o like manganese ii most iron iii complexes are high spin the exceptions being those with ligands that are high in the spectrochemical series such as cyanide an example of a low spin iron iii complex is fe cn the cyanide ligands may easily be detached in fe cn and hence this complex is poisonous unlike the iron ii complex fe cn found in prussian blue which does not release hydrogen cyanide except when dilute acids are added iron shows a great variety of electronic spin states including every possible spin quantum number value for a d block element from diamagnetic to unpaired electrons this value is always half the number of unpaired electrons complexes with zero to two unpaired electrons are considered low spin and those with four or five are considered high spin iron ii complexes are less stable than iron iii complexes but the preference for o donor ligands is less marked so that for example fe nh is known while fe nh is not they have a tendency to be oxidized to iron iii but this can be moderated by low ph and the specific ligands used organometallic compounds organoiron chemistry is the study of organometallic compounds of iron where carbon atoms are covalently bound to the metal atom they are many and varied including cyanide complexes carbonyl complexes sandwich and half sandwich compounds prussian blue or ferric ferrocyanide fe fe cn is an old and well known iron cyanide complex extensively used as pigment and in several other applications its formation can be used as a simple wet chemistry test to distinguish between aqueous solutions of fe and fe as they react respectively with potassium ferricyanide and potassium ferrocyanide to form prussian blue another old example of an organoiron compound is iron pentacarbonyl fe co in which a neutral iron atom is bound to the carbon atoms of five carbon monoxide molecules the compound can be used to make carbonyl iron powder a highly reactive form of metallic iron thermolysis of iron pentacarbonyl gives triiron dodecacarbonyl fe co a complex with a cluster of three iron atoms at its core collman s reagent disodium tetracarbonylferrate is a useful reagent for organic chemistry it contains iron in the oxidation state cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl dimer contains iron in the rare oxidation state a landmark in this field was the discovery in of the remarkably stable sandwich compound ferrocene fe c h by pauson and kealy and independently by miller and colleagues whose surprising molecular structure was determined only a year later by woodward and wilkinson and fischer ferrocene is still one of the most important tools and models in this class iron centered organometallic species are used as catalysts the kn lker complex for example is a transfer hydrogenation catalyst for ketones industrial uses the iron compounds produced on the largest scale in industry are iron ii sulfate feso h o and iron iii chloride fecl the former is one of the most readily available sources of iron ii but is less stable to aerial oxidation than mohr s salt nh fe so h o iron ii compounds tend to be oxidized to iron iii compounds in the air history development of iron metallurgy iron is one of the elements undoubtedly known to the ancient world it has been worked or wrought for millennia however iron artefacts of great age are much rarer than objects made of gold or silver due to the ease with which iron corrodes the technology developed slowly and even after the discovery of smelting it took many centuries for iron to replace bronze as the metal of choice for tools and weapons meteoritic iron beads made from meteoric iron in bc or earlier were found in gerzeh egypt by g a wainwright the beads contain nickel which is a signature of meteoric origin since iron found in the earth s crust generally has only minuscule nickel impurities meteoric iron was highly regarded due to its origin in the heavens and was often used to forge weapons and tools for example a dagger made of meteoric iron was found in the tomb of tutankhamun containing similar proportions of iron cobalt and nickel to a meteorite discovered in the area deposited by an ancient meteor shower items that were likely made of iron by egyptians date from to bc meteoritic iron is comparably soft and ductile and easily cold forged but may get brittle when heated because of the nickel content wrought iron the first iron production started in the middle bronze age but it took several centuries before iron displaced bronze samples of smelted iron from asmar mesopotamia and tall chagar bazaar in northern syria were made sometime between and bc the hittites established an empire in north central anatolia around bc they appear to be the first to understand the production of iron from its ores and regard it highly in their society the hittites began to smelt iron between and bc and the practice spread to the rest of the near east after their empire fell in bc the subsequent period is called the iron age artifacts of smelted iron are found in india dating from to bc and in the levant from about bc suggesting smelting in anatolia or the caucasus alleged references compare history of metallurgy in south asia to iron in the indian vedas have been used for claims of a very early usage of iron in india respectively to date the texts as such the rigveda term ayas metal refers to copper while iron which is called as y ma ayas literally black copper first is mentioned in the post rigvedic atharvaveda some archaeological evidence suggests iron was smelted in zimbabwe and southeast africa as early as the eighth century bc iron working was introduced to greece in the late th century bc from which it spread quickly throughout europe the spread of ironworking in central and western europe is associated with celtic expansion according to pliny the elder iron use was common in the roman era in the lands of what is now considered china iron appears approximately bc iron smelting may have been introduced into china through central asia the earliest evidence of the use of a blast furnace in china dates to the st century ad and cupola furnaces were used as early as the warring states period bc usage of the blast and cupola furnace remained widespread during the tang and song dynasties during the industrial revolution in britain henry cort began refining iron from pig iron to wrought iron or bar iron using innovative production systems in he patented the puddling process for refining iron ore it was later improved by others including joseph hall cast iron cast iron was first produced in china during th century bc but was hardly in europe until the medieval period the earliest cast iron artifacts were discovered by archaeologists in what is now modern luhe county jiangsu in china cast iron was used in ancient china for warfare agriculture and architecture during the medieval period means were found in europe of producing wrought iron from cast iron in this context known as pig iron using finery forges for all these processes charcoal was required as fuel medieval blast furnaces were about feet m tall and made of fireproof brick forced air was usually provided by hand operated bellows modern blast furnaces have grown much bigger with hearths fourteen meters in diameter that allow them to produce thousands of tons of iron each day but essentially operate in much the same way as they did during medieval times in abraham darby i established a coke fired blast furnace to produce cast iron replacing charcoal although continuing to use blast furnaces the ensuing availability of inexpensive iron was one of the factors leading to the industrial revolution toward the end of the th century cast iron began to replace wrought iron for certain purposes because it was cheaper carbon content in iron was not implicated as the reason for the differences in properties of wrought iron cast iron and steel until the th century since iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful it also became a major structural material following the building of the innovative first iron bridge in this bridge still stands today as a monument to the role iron played in the industrial revolution following this iron was used in rails boats ships aqueducts and buildings as well as in iron cylinders in steam engines railways have been central to the formation of modernity and ideas of progress and various languages e g french spanish italian and german refer to railways as iron road steel steel with smaller carbon content than pig iron but more than wrought iron was first produced in antiquity by using a bloomery blacksmiths in luristan in western persia were making good steel by bc then improved versions wootz steel by india and damascus steel were developed around bc and ad respectively these methods were specialized and so steel did not become a major commodity until the s new methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the th century in the industrial revolution new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel in the late s henry bessemer invented a new steelmaking process involving blowing air through molten pig iron to produce mild steel this made steel much more economical thereby leading to wrought iron no longer being produced in large quantities foundations of modern chemistry in antoine lavoisier used the reaction of water steam with metallic iron inside an incandescent iron tube to produce hydrogen in his experiments leading to the demonstration of the conservation of mass which was instrumental in changing chemistry from a qualitative science to a quantitative one symbolic role iron plays a certain role in mythology and has found various usage as a metaphor and in folklore the greek poet hesiod s works and days lines lists different ages of man named after metals like gold silver bronze and iron to account for successive ages of humanity the iron age was closely related with rome and in ovid s metamorphoses the virtues in despair quit the earth and the depravity of man becomes universal and complete hard steel succeeded then an example of the importance of iron s symbolic role may be found in the german campaign of frederick william iii commissioned then the first iron cross as military decoration berlin iron jewellery reached its peak production between and when the prussian royal family urged citizens to donate gold and silver jewellery for military funding the inscription gold gab ich f r eisen i gave gold for iron was used as well in later war efforts production of metallic iron laboratory routes for a few limited purposes when it is needed pure iron is produced in the laboratory in small quantities by reducing the pure oxide or hydroxide with hydrogen or forming iron pentacarbonyl and heating it to c so that it decomposes to form pure iron powder another method is electrolysis of ferrous chloride onto an iron cathode main industrial route nowadays the industrial production of iron or steel consists of two main stages in the first stage iron ore is reduced with coke in a blast furnace and the molten metal is separated from gross impurities such as silicate minerals this stage yields an alloy pig iron that contains relatively large amounts of carbon in the second stage the amount of carbon in the pig iron is lowered by oxidation to yield wrought iron steel or cast iron other metals can be added at this stage to form alloy steels blast furnace processing the blast furnace is loaded with iron ores usually hematite fe o or magnetite fe o along with coke coal that has been separately baked to remove volatile components and flux limestone or dolomite blasts of air pre heated to c sometimes with oxygen enrichment is blown through the mixture in sufficient amount to turn the carbon into carbon monoxide c o co displaystyle ce c o co this reaction raises the temperature to about c the carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore to metallic iron fe o co fe co displaystyle ce fe o co fe co some iron in the high temperature lower region of the furnace reacts directly with the coke fe o c fe co displaystyle ce fe o c fe co the flux removes silicaceous minerals in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace the heat of the furnace decomposes the carbonates to calcium oxide which reacts with any excess silica to form a slag composed of calcium silicate casio or other products at the furnace s temperature the metal and the slag are both molten they collect at the bottom as two immiscible liquid layers with the slag on top that are then easily separated the slag can be used as a material in road construction or to improve mineral poor soils for agriculture steelmaking thus remains one of the largest industrial contributors of co emissions in the world steelmaking the pig iron produced by the blast furnace process contains up to carbon by mass with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur magnesium phosphorus and manganese this high level of carbon makes it relatively weak and brittle reducing the amount of carbon to produces steel which may be up to times harder than pure iron a great variety of steel articles can then be made by cold working hot rolling forging machining etc removing the impurities from pig iron but leaving carbon results in cast iron which is cast by foundries into articles such as stoves pipes radiators lamp posts and rails steel products often undergo various heat treatments after they are forged to shape annealing consists of heating them to c for several hours and then gradual cooling it makes the steel softer and more workable direct iron reduction owing to environmental concerns alternative methods of processing iron have been developed direct iron reduction reduces iron ore to a ferrous lump called sponge iron or direct iron that is suitable for steelmaking two main reactions comprise the direct reduction process natural gas is partially oxidized with heat and a catalyst ch o co h displaystyle ce ch o co h iron ore is then treated with these gases in a furnace producing solid sponge iron fe o co h fe co h o displaystyle ce fe o co h fe co h o silica is removed by adding a limestone flux as described above thermite process ignition of a mixture of aluminium powder and iron oxide yields metallic iron via the thermite reaction fe o al fe al o displaystyle ce fe o al fe al o alternatively pig iron may be made into steel with up to about carbon or wrought iron commercially pure iron various processes have been used for this including finery forges puddling furnaces bessemer converters open hearth furnaces basic oxygen furnaces and electric arc furnaces in all cases the objective is to oxidize some or all of the carbon together with other impurities on the other hand other metals may be added to make alloy steels applications as structural material iron is the most widely used of all the metals accounting for over of worldwide metal production its low cost and high strength often make it the material of choice material to withstand stress or transmit forces such as the construction of machinery and machine tools rails automobiles ship hulls concrete reinforcing bars and the load carrying framework of buildings since pure iron is quite soft it is most commonly combined with alloying elements to make steel mechanical properties the mechanical properties of iron and its alloys are extremely relevant to their structural applications those properties can be evaluated in various ways including the brinell test the rockwell test and the vickers hardness test the properties of pure iron are often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests however the mechanical properties of iron are significantly affected by the sample s purity pure single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium and the purest industrially produced iron has a hardness of brinell the pure iron especially called electrolytic iron is industrially produced by electrolytic refining an increase in the carbon content will cause a significant increase in the hardness and tensile strength of iron maximum hardness of rc is achieved with a carbon content although the alloy has low tensile strength because of the softness of iron it is much easier to work with than its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium types of steels and alloys iron is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon no more than by mass at c austenite iron is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon as much as by mass at c this form of iron is used in the type of stainless steel used for making cutlery and hospital and food service equipment commercially available iron is classified based on purity and the abundance of additives pig iron has carbon and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as sulfur silicon and phosphorus pig iron is not a saleable product but rather an intermediate step in the production of cast iron and steel the reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect material properties such as sulfur and phosphorus yields cast iron containing carbon silicon and small amounts of manganese pig iron has a melting point in the range of k which is lower than either of its two main components and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy white cast irons contain their carbon in the form of cementite or iron carbide fe c this hard brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons rendering them hard but unresistant to shock the broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken iron carbide a very pale silvery shiny material hence the appellation cooling a mixture of iron with carbon slowly below c to room temperature results in separate alternating layers of cementite and iron which is soft and malleable and is called pearlite for its appearance rapid cooling on the other hand does not allow time for this separation and creates hard and brittle martensite the steel can then be tempered by reheating to a temperature in between changing the proportions of pearlite and martensite the end product below carbon content is a pearlite fe mixture and that above carbon content is a pearlite cementite mixture in gray iron the carbon exists as separate fine flakes of graphite and also renders the material brittle due to the sharp edged flakes of graphite that produce stress concentration sites within the material a newer variant of gray iron referred to as ductile iron is specially treated with trace amounts of magnesium to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids or nodules reducing the stress concentrations and vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material wrought iron contains less than carbon but large amounts of slag that give it a fibrous characteristic it is a tough malleable product but not as fusible as pig iron if honed to an edge it loses it quickly wrought iron is characterized by the presence of fine fibers of slag entrapped within the metal wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel it has been almost completely replaced by mild steel for traditional wrought iron products and blacksmithing mild steel corrodes more readily than wrought iron but is cheaper and more widely available carbon steel contains carbon or less with small amounts of manganese sulfur phosphorus and silicon alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals such as chromium vanadium molybdenum nickel tungsten etc their alloy content raises their cost and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses one common alloy steel though is stainless steel recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels also termed hsla or high strength low alloy steels containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost alloys with high purity elemental makeups such as alloys of electrolytic iron have specifically enhanced properties such as ductility tensile strength toughness fatigue strength heat resistance and corrosion resistance apart from traditional applications iron is also used for protection from ionizing radiation although it is lighter than another traditional protection material lead it is much stronger mechanically the attenuation of radiation as a function of energy is shown in the graph the main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron and most of its alloys suffer badly from rust if not protected in some way a cost amounting to over of the world s economy painting galvanization passivation plastic coating and bluing are all used to protect iron from rust by excluding water and oxygen or by cathodic protection the mechanism of the rusting of iron is as follows cathode o h o e oh anode fe fe e fe fe e overall fe o h o fe oh fe oh or feo oh h othe electrolyte is usually iron ii sulfate in urban areas formed when atmospheric sulfur dioxide attacks iron and salt particles in the atmosphere in seaside areas iron compounds although the dominant use of iron is in metallurgy iron compounds are also pervasive in industry iron catalysts are traditionally used in the haber bosch process for the production of ammonia and the fischer tropsch process for conversion of carbon monoxide to hydrocarbons for fuels and lubricants powdered iron in an acidic solvent was used in the bechamp reduction the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline iron based catalysts play a crucial role in converting biobased raw materials into valuable bulk and fine chemicals in fuel cells as well as in removal of hazardous chemicals iron iii oxide mixed with aluminium powder can be ignited to create a thermite reaction used in welding large iron parts like rails and purifying ores iron iii oxide and oxyhydroxide are used as reddish and ocher pigments iron iii chloride finds use in water purification and sewage treatment in the dyeing of cloth as a coloring agent in paints as an additive in animal feed and as an etchant for copper in the manufacture of printed circuit boards it can also be dissolved in alcohol to form tincture of iron which is used as a medicine to stop bleeding in canaries iron ii sulfate is used as a precursor to other iron compounds it is also used to reduce chromate in cement it is used to fortify foods and treat iron deficiency anemia iron iii sulfate is used in settling minute sewage particles in tank water iron ii chloride is used as a reducing flocculating agent in the formation of iron complexes and magnetic iron oxides and as a reducing agent in organic synthesis biological and pathological role iron is required for life the iron sulfur clusters are pervasive and include nitrogenase the enzymes responsible for biological nitrogen fixation iron containing proteins participate in transport storage and used of oxygen iron proteins are involved in electron transfer examples of iron containing proteins in higher organisms include hemoglobin cytochrome see high valent iron and catalase the average adult human contains about body weight of iron or about four grams of which three quarters is in hemoglobin a level that remains constant despite only about one milligram of iron being absorbed each day because the human body recycles its hemoglobin for the iron content microbial growth may be assisted by oxidation of iron ii or by reduction of iron iii biochemistry iron acquisition poses a problem for aerobic organisms because ferric iron is poorly soluble near neutral ph thus these organisms have developed means to absorb iron as complexes sometimes taking up ferrous iron before oxidising it back to ferric iron in particular bacteria have evolved very high affinity sequestering agents called siderophores after uptake in human cells iron storage is precisely regulated a major component of this regulation is the protein transferrin which binds iron ions absorbed from the duodenum and carries it in the blood to cells transferrin contains fe in the middle of a distorted octahedron bonded to one nitrogen three oxygens and a chelating carbonate anion that traps the fe ion it has such a high stability constant that it is very effective at taking up fe ions even from the most stable complexes at the bone marrow transferrin is reduced from fe and fe and stored as ferritin to be incorporated into hemoglobin the most commonly known and studied bioinorganic iron compounds biological iron molecules are the heme proteins examples are hemoglobin myoglobin and cytochrome p these compounds participate in transporting gases building enzymes and transferring electrons metalloproteins are a group of proteins with metal ion cofactors some examples of iron metalloproteins are ferritin and rubredoxin many enzymes vital to life contain iron such as catalase lipoxygenases and ire bp hemoglobin is an oxygen carrier that occurs in red blood cells and contributes their color transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to myoglobin which stores it until it is needed for the metabolic oxidation of glucose generating energy here the hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide produced when glucose is oxidized which is transported through the veins by hemoglobin predominantly as bicarbonate anions back to the lungs where it is exhaled in hemoglobin the iron is in one of four heme groups and has six possible coordination sites four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a porphyrin ring the fifth by an imidazole nitrogen in a histidine residue of one of the protein chains attached to the heme group and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can reversibly bind to when hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen and is then called deoxyhemoglobin the fe ion at the center of the heme group in the hydrophobic protein interior is in a high spin configuration it is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring which bends instead into a dome with the fe ion about picometers above it in this configuration the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue when deoxyhemoglobin picks up an oxygen molecule this histidine residue moves away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached to form a hydrogen bond with it this results in the fe ion switching to a low spin configuration resulting in a decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the porphyrin ring which becomes planar additionally this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule resulting in a fe o o bond angle of around that avoids the formation of fe o fe or fe o fe bridges that would lead to electron transfer the oxidation of fe to fe and the destruction of hemoglobin this results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity thus when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen its affinity for more oxygen increases and vice versa myoglobin on the other hand contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur thus while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs its affinity for oxygen is much lower than that of myoglobin which oxygenates even at low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue as described by the bohr effect named after christian bohr the father of niels bohr the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin diminishes in the presence of carbon dioxide carbon monoxide and phosphorus trifluoride are poisonous to humans because they bind to hemoglobin similarly to oxygen but with much more strength so that oxygen can no longer be transported throughout the body hemoglobin bound to carbon monoxide is known as carboxyhemoglobin this effect also plays a minor role in the toxicity of cyanide but there the major effect is by far its interference with the proper functioning of the electron transport protein cytochrome a the cytochrome proteins also involve heme groups and are involved in the metabolic oxidation of glucose by oxygen the sixth coordination site is then occupied by either another imidazole nitrogen or a methionine sulfur so that these proteins are largely inert to oxygen with the exception of cytochrome a which bonds directly to oxygen and thus is very easily poisoned by cyanide here the electron transfer takes place as the iron remains in low spin but changes between the and oxidation states since the reduction potential of each step is slightly greater than the previous one the energy is released step by step and can thus be stored in adenosine triphosphate cytochrome a is slightly distinct as it occurs at the mitochondrial membrane binds directly to oxygen and transports protons as well as electrons as follows cytc o h inside cytc h o h outsidealthough the heme proteins are the most important class of iron containing proteins the iron sulfur proteins are also very important being involved in electron transfer which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the or oxidation states these have one two four or eight iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms because of this tetrahedral coordination they always have high spin iron the simplest of such compounds is rubredoxin which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from cysteine residues in the surrounding peptide chains another important class of iron sulfur proteins is the ferredoxins which have multiple iron atoms transferrin does not belong to either of these classes the ability of sea mussels to maintain their grip on rocks in the ocean is facilitated by their use of organometallic iron based bonds in their protein rich cuticles based on synthetic replicas the presence of iron in these structures increased elastic modulus times tensile strength times and toughness times the amount of stress required to permanently damage them increased times nutrition diet iron is pervasive but particularly rich sources of dietary iron include red meat oysters lentils beans poultry fish leaf vegetables watercress tofu chickpeas black eyed peas and blackstrap molasses bread and breakfast cereals are sometimes specifically fortified with iron iron provided by dietary supplements is often found as iron ii fumarate although iron ii sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well elemental iron or reduced iron despite being absorbed at only one third to two thirds the efficiency relative to iron sulfate is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or enriched wheat flour iron is most available to the body when chelated to amino acids and is also available for use as a common iron supplement glycine the least expensive amino acid is most often used to produce iron glycinate supplements dietary recommendations the u s institute of medicine iom updated estimated average

new adult daily values is provided at reference daily intake deficiency iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world when loss of iron is not adequately compensated by adequate dietary iron intake a state of latent iron deficiency occurs which over time leads to iron deficiency anemia if left untreated which is characterised by an insufficient number of red blood cells and an insufficient amount of hemoglobin children pre menopausal women women of child bearing age and people with poor diet are most susceptible to the disease most cases of iron deficiency anemia are mild but if not treated can cause problems like fast or irregular heartbeat complications during pregnancy and delayed growth in infants and children excess iron uptake is tightly regulated by the human body which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing so control of iron levels is primarily accomplished by regulating uptake regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the hla h gene region on chromosome and leads to abnormally low levels of hepcidin a key regulator of the entry of iron into the circulatory system in mammals in these people excessive iron intake can result in iron overload disorders known medically as hemochromatosis many people have an undiagnosed genetic susceptibility to iron overload and are not aware of a family history of the problem for this reason people should not take iron supplements unless they suffer from iron deficiency and have consulted a doctor hemochromatosis is estimated to be the cause of to of all metabolic diseases of caucasians overdoses of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of free iron in the blood high blood levels of free ferrous iron react with peroxides to produce highly reactive free radicals that can damage dna proteins lipids and other cellular components iron toxicity occurs when the cell contains free iron which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the availability of transferrin to bind the iron damage to the cells of the gastrointestinal tract can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption leading to further increases in blood levels iron typically damages cells in the heart liver and elsewhere causing adverse effects that include coma metabolic acidosis shock liver failure coagulopathy long term organ damage and even death humans experience iron toxicity when the iron exceeds milligrams for every kilogram

some research has suggested that low thalamic iron levels may play a role in the pathophysiology of adhd some researchers have found that iron supplementation can be effective especially in the inattentive subtype of the disorder one study also showed that iron may be able to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events during treatment with adhd drugs some researchers in the s suggested a link between low levels of iron in the blood and adhd a study found no such correlation cancer the role of iron in cancer defense can be described as a double edged sword because of its pervasive presence in non pathological processes people having chemotherapy may develop iron deficiency and anemia for which intravenous iron therapy is used to restore iron levels iron overload which may occur from high consumption of red meat may initiate tumor growth and increase susceptibility to cancer onset particularly for colorectal cancer marine systems iron plays an essential role in marine systems and can act as a limiting nutrient for planktonic activity because of this too much of a decrease in iron may lead to a decrease in growth rates in phytoplanktonic organisms such as diatoms iron can also be oxidized by marine microbes under conditions that are high in iron and low in oxygen iron can enter marine systems through adjoining rivers and directly from the atmosphere once iron enters the ocean it can be distributed throughout the water column through ocean mixing and through recycling on the cellular level in the arctic sea ice plays a major role in the store and distribution of iron in the ocean depleting oceanic iron as it freezes in the winter and releasing it back into the water when thawing occurs in the summer the iron cycle can fluctuate the forms of iron from aqueous to particle forms altering the availability of iron to primary producers increased light and warmth increases the amount of iron that is in forms that are usable by primary producers ,26
Cobalt,Co,cobalt is a chemical element with the symbol co and atomic number as with nickel cobalt is found in the earth s crust only in a chemically combined form save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron the free element produced by reductive smelting is a hard lustrous silver gray metal cobalt based blue pigments cobalt blue have been used since ancient times for jewelry and paints and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass but the color was for a long time thought to be due to the known metal bismuth miners had long used the name kobold ore german for goblin ore for some of the blue pigment producing minerals they were so named because they were poor in known metals and gave poisonous arsenic containing fumes when smelted in such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal the first discovered since ancient times and this was ultimately named for the kobold today some cobalt is produced specifically from one of a number of metallic lustered ores such as cobaltite coass the element is however more usually produced as a by product of copper and nickel mining the copperbelt in the democratic republic of the congo drc and zambia yields most

glass ceramics inks paints and varnishes cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable isotope cobalt cobalt is a commercially important radioisotope used as a radioactive tracer and for the production of high energy gamma rays cobalt is the active center of a group of coenzymes called cobalamins vitamin b the best known example of the type is an essential vitamin for all animals cobalt in inorganic

magnetons per atom cobalt has a relative permeability two thirds that of iron metallic cobalt occurs as two crystallographic structures hcp and fcc the ideal transition temperature between the hcp and fcc structures is c f but in practice the energy difference between them is so small that random intergrowth of the two is common cobalt is a weakly reducing metal that is protected from oxidation by a passivating oxide film it is attacked by halogens and sulfur heating in oxygen produces co o which loses oxygen at c f to give the monoxide coo the metal reacts with fluorine f at k to give cof with chlorine cl bromine br and iodine i producing equivalent binary halides it does not react with hydrogen gas h or nitrogen gas n even when heated but it does react with boron carbon phosphorus arsenic

dihalides of cobalt ii are known cobalt ii fluoride cof pink cobalt ii chloride cocl blue cobalt ii bromide cobr green cobalt ii iodide coi blue black these halides exist in anhydrous and hydrated forms whereas the anhydrous dichloride is blue the hydrate is red the reduction potential for the reaction co e co is v beyond that for chlorine to chloride v consequently cobalt iii chloride would spontaneously reduce to cobalt ii chloride and chlorine because the reduction potential for fluorine to fluoride is so high v cobalt iii fluoride is one of the few simple stable cobalt iii compounds cobalt iii fluoride which is used in some fluorination reactions reacts vigorously with water coordination compounds as for all metals molecular compounds and polyatomic ions of cobalt are classified as coordination complexes that is molecules or ions that contain cobalt linked to one or more ligands these can be combinations of a potentially infinite variety of molecules and ions such as water h

the stability of oxidation states of the cobalt atoms according to general principles of electronegativity and of the hardness softness for example co complexes tend to have ammine ligands because phosphorus is softer than nitrogen phosphine ligands tend to feature the softer co and co an example being tris triphenylphosphine cobalt i chloride p c h cocl the more electronegative and harder

of the first coordination complexes to be resolved into optical isomers the complex exists in the right and left handed forms of a three bladed propeller this complex was first isolated by werner as yellow gold needle like crystals organometallic compounds cobaltocene is a structural analog to ferrocene with cobalt in place of iron cobaltocene is much more sensitive to oxidation than ferrocene cobalt carbonyl co co is a catalyst in carbonylation and hydrosilylation reactions vitamin b see below is an organometallic compound found in nature and is the only vitamin that contains a metal atom

for its resistance to hydrogen elimination in accord with bredt s rule the cobalt iii and cobalt v complexes li thf co norb and co norb bf are also known isotopes co is the only stable cobalt isotope and the only isotope that exists naturally on earth twenty two radioisotopes have been characterized the most stable co has a half life of years co has a half life of days co has a half life of days and co has a half life of days all the other radioactive isotopes of cobalt have half lives shorter than hours and in most cases shorter than second this element also has meta states all of which have half lives shorter than minutes the isotopes of cobalt range in atomic weight from u co to u co the primary decay mode for isotopes with atomic mass unit values less than that of the only stable isotope co is electron capture and the primary mode of decay in isotopes with atomic mass greater than atomic mass units is beta decay the primary decay products below co are element iron isotopes above that the decay products are element nickel isotopes history cobalt compounds have been used for centuries to impart a rich blue color to glass glazes and ceramics cobalt has been detected in egyptian sculpture persian jewelry from the third millennium bc in the ruins of pompeii destroyed in ad and in china dating from the tang dynasty ad and the ming dynasty ad cobalt has been used to color glass since the bronze age the excavation of the uluburun shipwreck yielded an ingot of blue glass cast during the th century bc blue glass from egypt was either colored with copper iron or cobalt the oldest cobalt colored glass is from the eighteenth dynasty of egypt bc the source for the cobalt the egyptians used is not known the word cobalt is derived from the german kobalt from kobold meaning goblin a superstitious term used for the ore of cobalt by miners the first attempts to smelt those ores for copper or silver failed yielding simply powder cobalt ii oxide instead because the primary ores of cobalt always contain arsenic smelting the ore oxidized the arsenic into the highly toxic and volatile arsenic oxide adding to the notoriety of the ore swedish chemist georg brandt is credited with discovering cobalt circa showing it to be a previously unknown element distinct from bismuth and other traditional metals brandt called it a new semi metal he showed that compounds of cobalt metal were the source of the blue color in glass which previously had been attributed to the bismuth found with cobalt cobalt became the first metal to be discovered since the pre historical period all other known metals iron copper silver gold zinc mercury tin lead and bismuth had no recorded discoverers during the th century a significant part of the world s production of cobalt blue a pigment made with cobalt compounds and alumina and smalt cobalt glass powdered for use for pigment purposes in ceramics and painting was carried out at the norwegian blaafarvev rket the first mines for the production of smalt in the th century were located in norway sweden saxony and hungary with the discovery of cobalt ore in new caledonia in the mining of cobalt in europe declined with the discovery of ore deposits in ontario canada in and the discovery of even larger deposits in the katanga province in the congo in the mining operations shifted again when the shaba conflict started in the copper mines of katanga province nearly stopped production the impact on the world cobalt economy from this conflict was smaller than expected cobalt is a rare metal the pigment is highly toxic and the industry had already established effective ways for recycling cobalt materials in some cases industry was able to change to cobalt free alternatives in john livingood and glenn t seaborg discovered the radioisotope cobalt this isotope was famously used at columbia university in the s to establish parity violation in radioactive beta decay after world war ii the us wanted to guarantee the supply of cobalt ore for military uses as the germans had been doing and prospected for cobalt within the u s border an adequate supply of the ore was found in idaho near blackbird canyon in the side of a mountain the firm calera mining company started production at the site it has been argued that cobalt will be one of the main objects of geopolitical competition in a world running on renewable energy and dependent on batteries but this perspective has also been criticised for underestimating the power of economic incentives for expanded production occurrence the stable form of cobalt is produced in supernovae through the r process it comprises of the earth s crust free cobalt the native metal is not found on earth because of the oxygen in the atmosphere and the chlorine in the ocean both are abundant enough in the upper layers of the earth s crust to prevent native metal cobalt from forming except as recently delivered in meteoric iron pure cobalt in native metal form is unknown on earth the element has a medium abundance but natural compounds of cobalt are numerous and small amounts of cobalt compounds are found in most rocks soils plants and animals in nature cobalt is frequently associated with nickel both are characteristic components of meteoric iron though cobalt is much less abundant in iron meteorites than nickel as with nickel cobalt in meteoric iron alloys may have been well enough protected from oxygen and moisture to remain as the free but alloyed metal though neither element is seen in that form in the ancient terrestrial crust cobalt in compound form occurs in copper and nickel minerals it is the major metallic component that combines with sulfur and arsenic in the sulfidic cobaltite coass safflorite coas glaucodot co fe ass and skutterudite coas minerals the mineral cattierite is similar to pyrite and occurs together with vaesite in the copper deposits of katanga province when it reaches the atmosphere weathering occurs the sulfide minerals oxidize and form pink erythrite cobalt glance co aso h o and spherocobaltite coco cobalt is also a constituent of tobacco smoke the tobacco plant readily absorbs and accumulates heavy metals like cobalt from the surrounding soil in its leaves these are subsequently inhaled during tobacco smoking in the ocean cobalt is a trace metal involved in photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation detected in most ocean basins and is a limiting micronutrient for phytoplankton and cyanobacteria the co containing complex cobalamin is only synthesized by cyanobacteria and a few archaea so dissolved cobalt concentrations are low in the upper ocean like mn and fe co has a hybrid profile of biological uptake by phytoplankton via photosynthesis in the upper ocean and scavenging in the deep ocean although most scavenging is limited by complex organic ligands co is recycled in the ocean by decaying organic matter that sinks below the upper ocean although most is scavenged by oxidizing bacteria sources of cobalt for many ocean bodies include rivers and terrestrial runoff with some input from hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean cobalt sources are found lying on top of seamounts which can be large or small where ocean currents sweep the ocean floor to clear sediment over the span of millions of years allowing them to form as ferromanganese crusts although limited mapping of the seafloor has been done preliminary investigation indicates that there is a large amount of these cobalt rich crusts located in the clarion clipperton zone an area garnering increasing interest for deep sea mining ventures due to the mineral rich environment within its domain anthropogenic input contributes as a non natural source but in very low amounts dissolved cobalt dco concentrations across oceans are controlled primarily by reservoirs where dissolved oxygen concentrations are low the complex biochemical cycling of cobalt in the ocean is still not fully understood but patterns of higher concentrations have been found in areas of low oxygen such as the oxygen minimum zone omz in the southern atlantic ocean cobalt is considered toxic for marine environments at high concentrations safe concentrations fall around g l in marine waters for plankton such as diatoms production the main ores of cobalt are cobaltite erythrite glaucodot and skutterudite see above but most cobalt is obtained by reducing the cobalt by products of nickel and copper mining and smelting since cobalt is generally produced as a by product the supply of cobalt depends to a great extent on the economic feasibility of copper and nickel mining in a given market demand for cobalt was projected to grow in primary cobalt deposits are rare such as those occurring in hydrothermal deposits associated with ultramafic rocks typified by the bou azzer district of morocco at such locations cobalt ores are mined exclusively albeit at a lower concentration and thus require more downstream processing for cobalt extraction several methods exist to separate cobalt from copper and nickel depending on the concentration of cobalt and the exact composition of the used ore one method is froth flotation in which surfactants bind to ore components leading to an enrichment of cobalt ores subsequent roasting converts the ores to cobalt sulfate and the copper and the iron are oxidized to the oxide leaching with water extracts the sulfate together with the arsenates the residues are further leached with sulfuric acid yielding a solution of copper sulfate cobalt can also be leached from the slag of copper smelting the products of the above mentioned processes are transformed into the cobalt oxide co o this oxide is reduced to metal by the aluminothermic reaction or reduction with carbon in a blast furnace extraction the united states geological survey estimates world reserves of cobalt at metric tons the democratic republic of the congo drc currently produces of

for artisanal miners and the surrounding communities the political and ethnic dynamics of the region have in the past caused outbreaks of violence and years of armed conflict and displaced populations this instability affected the price of cobalt and also created perverse incentives for the combatants in the first and second congo wars to prolong the fighting since access to diamond mines and other

of the electric vehicle age due to its cobalt resources as essential to the lithium ion batteries that drive electric vehicles on march president joseph kabila updated the mining code increasing royalty charges and declaring cobalt and coltan strategic metals the mining code was effectively updated on december in december international rights advocates a human rights ngo filed a landmark lawsuit against apple tesla dell microsoft and google company alphabet for knowingly benefiting from and aiding and abetting the cruel and brutal use of young children in mining cobalt the companies in question denied their involvement in child labour canada in some exploration companies were planning to survey old silver and cobalt mines in the area of cobalt ontario where significant deposits are believed to lie canada s sherritt international processes cobalt ores in nickel deposits from the moa mines in cuba and the island has several others mines in mayari camaguey and pinar del rio continued investments by sherritt international in cuban nickel and cobalt production while acquiring mining rights for years made the communist country third for cobalt reserves in before canada itself applications in tonnes short tons of cobalt was used cobalt has been used in the production of high performance alloys it is also used in some rechargeable batteries alloys cobalt based superalloys have historically consumed most of the cobalt produced the temperature stability of these alloys makes them suitable for turbine blades for gas turbines and aircraft jet engines although nickel based single crystal alloys surpass them in performance cobalt based alloys are also corrosion and wear resistant making them like titanium useful for making orthopedic implants that don t wear down over time the development of wear resistant cobalt alloys started in the first decade of the th century with the stellite alloys containing chromium with varying quantities of tungsten and carbon alloys with chromium and tungsten carbides are very hard and wear resistant special cobalt chromium molybdenum alloys like vitallium are used for prosthetic parts hip and knee replacements cobalt alloys are also used for dental prosthetics as a useful substitute for nickel which may be allergenic some high speed steels also contain cobalt for increased heat and wear resistance the special alloys of aluminium nickel cobalt and iron known as alnico and of samarium and cobalt samarium cobalt magnet are used in permanent magnets it is also alloyed with platinum for jewelry yielding an alloy suitable for fine casting which is also slightly magnetic batteries lithium cobalt oxide licoo is widely used in lithium ion battery cathodes the material is composed of cobalt oxide layers with the lithium intercalated during discharge i e when not actively being charged the lithium is released as lithium ions nickel cadmium nicd and nickel metal hydride nimh batteries also include cobalt to improve the oxidation of nickel in the battery transparency market research estimated the global lithium ion battery market at billion in and predicted an increase to over us billion by although in most cobalt in batteries was used in a mobile device a more recent application for cobalt is rechargeable batteries for electric cars this industry has increased five fold in its demand for cobalt which makes it urgent to find new raw materials in more stable areas of the world demand is expected to continue or increase as the prevalence of electric vehicles increases exploration in included the area around cobalt ontario an area where many silver mines ceased operation decades ago cobalt for electric vehicles increased from the first half of to tonnes in the first half of for a battery capacity of gwh the future of electric cars may depend on deep sea mining since cobalt is abundant in rocks on the seabed since child and slave labor have been repeatedly reported in cobalt mining primarily in the artisanal mines of dr congo technology companies seeking an ethical supply chain have faced shortages of this raw material and the price of cobalt metal reached a nine year high in october more than us a pound versus us in late after oversupply the price dropped to a more normal in as a reaction to the issues with artisanal cobalt mining in dr congo a number of cobalt suppliers and their customers have formed the fair cobalt alliance fca which aims to end the use of child labor and to improve the working conditions of cobalt mining and processing in the dr congo members of fca include zhejiang huayou cobalt sono motors the responsible cobalt initiative fairphone glencore and tesla inc research is being conducted by the european union on the possibility to eliminate cobalt requirements in lithium ion battery production as of august battery makers have gradually reduced the cathode cobalt content from nmc to nmc to currently nmc and have also introduced the cobalt free lfp cathode into the battery packs of electric cars such as the tesla model in september tesla outlined their plans to make their own cobalt free battery cells catalysts several cobalt compounds are oxidation catalysts cobalt acetate is used to convert xylene to terephthalic acid the precursor of the bulk polymer polyethylene terephthalate typical catalysts are the cobalt carboxylates known as cobalt soaps they are also used in paints varnishes and inks as drying agents through the oxidation of drying oils the same carboxylates are used to improve the adhesion between steel and rubber in steel belted radial tires in addition they are used as accelerators in polyester resin systems cobalt based catalysts are used in reactions involving carbon monoxide cobalt is also a catalyst in the fischer tropsch process for the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide into liquid fuels hydroformylation of alkenes often uses cobalt octacarbonyl as a catalyst the hydrodesulfurization of petroleum uses a catalyst derived from cobalt and molybdenum this process helps to clean petroleum of sulfur impurities that interfere with the refining of liquid fuels pigments and coloring before the th century cobalt was predominantly used as a pigment it has been used since the middle ages to make smalt a blue colored glass smalt is produced by melting a mixture of roasted mineral smaltite quartz and potassium carbonate which yields a dark blue silicate glass which is finely ground after the production smalt was widely used to color glass and as pigment for paintings in sven rinman discovered cobalt green and in louis jacques th nard discovered cobalt blue cobalt pigments such as cobalt blue cobalt aluminate cerulean blue cobalt ii stannate various hues of cobalt green a mixture of cobalt ii oxide and zinc oxide and cobalt violet cobalt phosphate are used as artist s pigments because of their superior chromatic stability radioisotopes cobalt co or co is useful as a gamma ray source because it can be produced in predictable amounts with high activity by bombarding cobalt with neutrons it produces gamma rays with energies of and mev cobalt is used in external beam radiotherapy sterilization of medical supplies and medical waste radiation treatment of foods for sterilization cold pasteurization industrial radiography e g weld integrity radiographs density measurements e g concrete density measurements and tank fill height switches the metal has the unfortunate property of producing a fine dust causing problems with radiation protection cobalt from radiotherapy machines has been a serious hazard when not discarded properly and one of the worst radiation contamination accidents in north america occurred in when a discarded radiotherapy unit containing cobalt was mistakenly disassembled in a junkyard in juarez mexico cobalt has a radioactive half life of years loss of potency requires periodic replacement of the source in radiotherapy and is one reason why cobalt machines have been largely replaced by linear accelerators in modern radiation therapy cobalt co or co is a cobalt radioisotope most often used in medical tests as a radiolabel for vitamin b uptake and for the schilling test cobalt is used as a source in m ssbauer spectroscopy and is one of several possible sources in x ray fluorescence devices nuclear weapon designs could intentionally incorporate co some of which would be activated in a nuclear explosion to produce co the co dispersed as nuclear fallout is sometimes called a cobalt bomb other uses cobalt is used in electroplating for its attractive appearance hardness and resistance to oxidation it is also used as a base primer coat for porcelain enamels biological role cobalt is essential to the metabolism of all animals it is a key constituent of cobalamin also known as vitamin b the primary biological reservoir of cobalt as an ultratrace element bacteria in the stomachs of ruminant animals convert cobalt salts into vitamin b a compound which can only be produced by bacteria or archaea a minimal presence of cobalt in soils therefore markedly improves the health of grazing animals and an uptake of mg kg a day is recommended because they have no other source of vitamin b proteins based on cobalamin use corrin to hold the cobalt coenzyme b features a reactive c co bond that participates in the reactions in

corrin cobalt enzyme is nitrile hydratase an enzyme in bacteria that metabolizes nitriles cobalt deficiency in humans consumption of cobalt containing vitamin b meets all needs for cobalt for cattle and sheep which meet vitamin b needs via synthesis by resident bacteria in the rumen there is a function for inorganic cobalt in the early th century during the development of farming on the north island volcanic plateau of new zealand cattle suffered from what was termed bush sickness it was discovered that the volcanic soils lacked the cobalt salts essential for the cattle food chain the coast disease of sheep in the ninety mile desert of the southeast of south australia in the s was found to originate in nutritional deficiencies of trace elements cobalt and copper the cobalt deficiency was overcome by the development of cobalt bullets dense pellets of cobalt oxide mixed with clay given orally for lodging in the animal s rumen health issues the ld value for soluble cobalt salts has been estimated to be between and mg kg in the us the occupational safety and health administration osha has designated a permissible exposure limit pel in the workplace as a time weighted

Nickel,Ni,nickel is a chemical element with symbol ni and atomic number it is a silvery white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge nickel is a hard and ductile transition metal pure nickel is chemically reactive but large pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because a passivation layer of nickel oxide forms on the surface that prevents further corrosion even so pure native nickel is found in earth s crust only in tiny amounts usually in ultramafic rocks and in the interiors of larger nickel iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside earth s atmosphere meteoric nickel is found in combination with iron a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis an iron nickel mixture is thought to compose earth s outer and inner cores use of nickel as natural meteoric nickel iron alloy has been traced as far back as bce nickel was first isolated and classified as an element in by axel fredrik cronstedt who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral in the cobalt mines of los h lsingland sweden the element s name comes from a mischievous sprite of german miner mythology nickel similar to old nick who personified the fact that copper nickel ores resisted refinement into copper an economically important source of nickel is the iron ore limonite which is often nickel other important nickel ore minerals include pentlandite and a mix of ni rich natural silicates known as garnierite major production sites include the sudbury region canada which is thought to be of meteoric origin new caledonia in the pacific and norilsk russia nickel is one of four elements the others are iron cobalt and gadolinium that are ferromagnetic at about room temperature alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron based permanent magnets and rare earth magnets the metal is used chiefly in alloys and corrosion resistant plating about of world production is used in stainless steel a further is used for nickel based and copper based alloys for plating for alloy steels in foundries and in other applications such as in rechargeable batteries including those in electric vehicles evs nickel is widely used in coins though nickel plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy as a compound nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses such as a catalyst for hydrogenation cathodes for rechargeable batteries pigments and metal surface treatments nickel is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickel as an active site properties atomic and physical properties nickel is a silvery white metal with a slight golden tinge that takes a high polish it is one of only four elements that are ferromagnetic at or near room temperature the others are iron cobalt and gadolinium its curie temperature is c f meaning that bulk nickel is non magnetic above this temperature the unit cell of nickel is a face centered cube with the lattice parameter of nm giving an atomic radius of nm this crystal structure is stable to pressures of at least gpa nickel is hard malleable and ductile and has a relatively high electrical and thermal conductivity for transition metals the high compressive strength of gpa predicted for ideal crystals is never obtained in the real bulk material due to formation and movement of dislocations however it has been reached in ni nanoparticles electron configuration dispute nickel has two atomic electron configurations ar d s and ar d s which are very close in energy ar denotes the complete argon core structure there is some disagreement on which configuration has the lower energy chemistry textbooks quote nickel s electron configuration as ar s d also written ar d s this configuration agrees with the madelung energy ordering rule which predicts that s is filled before d it is supported by the experimental fact that the lowest energy state of the nickel atom is a d s energy level specifically the d f s f j level however each of these two configurations splits into several energy levels due to fine structure and the two sets of energy levels overlap the average energy of states with ar d s is actually lower than the average energy of states with ar d s therefore the research literature on atomic calculations quotes the ground state configuration as ar d s isotopes the isotopes of nickel range in atomic weight from u ni to u ni natural nickel is composed of five stable isotopes ni ni ni ni and ni of which ni is the most abundant natural abundance nickel has the highest binding energy per nucleon of any nuclide mev nucleon its binding energy is greater than both fe and fe more abundant nuclides often incorrectly cited as having the highest binding energy though this would seem to predict nickel as the most abundant heavy element in the universe the high rate of photodisintegration of nickel in stellar interiors causes iron to be by far the most abundant nickel is the daughter product of the extinct radionuclide fe half life million years due to the long half life of fe its persistence in materials in the solar system may generate observable variations in the isotopic composition of ni therefore the abundance of ni in extraterrestrial material may give insight into the origin of the solar system and its early history at least nickel radioisotopes have been characterized the most stable are ni with half life years ni years and ni days all other radioisotopes have half lives less than hours and most these have half lives less than seconds this element also has one meta state radioactive nickel is produced by the silicon burning process and later set free in large amounts in type ia supernovae the shape of the light curve of these supernovae at intermediate to late times corresponds to the decay via electron capture of ni to cobalt and ultimately to iron nickel is a long lived cosmogenic radionuclide half life years ni has found many applications in isotope geology ni has been used to date the terrestrial age of meteorites and to determine abundances of extraterrestrial dust in ice and sediment the half life of nickel was recently measured at milliseconds and is believed an important isotope in supernova nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than iron ni discovered in is the most proton rich heavy element isotope known with protons and neutrons ni is doubly magic as is ni with protons and neutrons both are therefore unusually stable for nuclei with so large a proton neutron imbalance nickel is a contaminant found in the support structure of nuclear reactors it is produced through neutron capture by nickel small amounts have also been found near nuclear weapon test sites in the south pacific occurrence on earth nickel occurs most often in combination with sulfur and iron in pentlandite with sulfur in millerite with arsenic in the mineral nickeline and with arsenic and sulfur in nickel galena nickel is commonly found in iron meteorites as the alloys kamacite and taenite nickel in meteorites was first detected in by joseph louis proust a french chemist who then worked in spain proust analyzed samples of the meteorite from campo del cielo argentina which had been obtained in by miguel rub n de celis discovering the presence in them of nickel about along with iron the bulk of nickel is mined from two types of ore deposits the first is laterite where the principal ore mineral mixtures are nickeliferous limonite fe ni o oh and garnierite a mixture of various hydrous nickel and nickel rich silicates the second is magmatic sulfide deposits where the principal ore mineral is pentlandite ni fe s indonesia and australia have the biggest estimated reserves at of world total identified land based resources throughout the world averaging nickel or greater comprise at least million tons of nickel about the double of known reserves about is in laterites and in sulfide deposits on geophysical evidence most of the nickel on earth is believed to be in earth s outer and inner cores kamacite and taenite are naturally occurring alloys of iron and nickel for kamacite the alloy is usually in the proportion of to though impurities such as cobalt or carbon may be present taenite is to nickel kamacite and taenite are also found in nickel iron meteorites compounds the most common oxidation state of nickel is but compounds of ni ni and ni are well known and the exotic oxidation states ni and ni have been produced and studied nickel nickel tetracarbonyl ni co discovered by ludwig mond is a volatile highly toxic liquid at room temperature on heating the complex decomposes back to nickel and carbon monoxide ni co ni co this behavior is exploited in the mond process for purifying nickel as described above the related nickel complex bis cyclooctadiene nickel is a useful catalyst in organonickel chemistry because the cyclooctadiene or cod ligands are easily displaced nickel i nickel i complexes are uncommon but one example is the tetrahedral complex nibr pph many nickel i complexes have ni ni bonding such as the dark red diamagnetic k ni cn prepared by reduction of k ni cn with sodium amalgam this compound is oxidized in water liberating h it is thought that the nickel i oxidation state is important to nickel containing enzymes such as nife hydrogenase which catalyzes the reversible reduction of protons to h nickel ii nickel ii forms compounds with all common anions including sulfide sulfate carbonate hydroxide carboxylates and halides nickel ii sulfate is produced in large amounts by dissolving nickel metal or oxides in sulfuric acid forming both a hexa and heptahydrate useful for electroplating nickel common salts of nickel such as chloride nitrate and sulfate dissolve in water to give green solutions of the metal aquo complex ni h o the four halides form nickel compounds which are solids with molecules with octahedral ni centres nickel ii chloride is most common and its behavior is illustrative of the other halides nickel ii chloride is made by dissolving nickel or its oxide in hydrochloric acid it is usually found as the green hexahydrate whose formula is usually written nicl h o when dissolved in water this salt forms the metal aquo complex ni h o dehydration of nicl h o gives yellow anhydrous nicl some tetracoordinate nickel ii complexes e g bis triphenylphosphine nickel chloride exist both in tetrahedral and square planar geometries the tetrahedral complexes are paramagnetic the square planar complexes are diamagnetic in having properties of magnetic equilibrium and formation of octahedral complexes they contrast with the divalent complexes of the heavier group metals palladium ii and platinum ii which form only square planar geometry nickelocene is known it has an electron count of making it relatively unstable nickel iii and iv many ni iii compounds are known the first such compounds are ni pr x where x cl br i and r ethyl propyl butyl further ni iii forms simple salts with fluoride or oxide ions ni iii can be stabilized by donor ligands such as thiols and organophosphines ni iii occurs in nickel oxide hydroxide which is used as the cathode in many rechargeable batteries including nickel cadmium nickel iron nickel hydrogen and nickel metal hydride and used by certain manufacturers in li ion batteries ni iv occurs in the mixed oxide banio ni iv remains a rare oxidation state and very few compounds are known history because nickel ores are easily mistaken for ores of silver and copper understanding of this metal and its use is relatively recent but unintentional use of nickel is ancient and can be traced back as far as bce bronzes from what is now syria have been found to contain as much as nickel some ancient chinese manuscripts suggest that white copper cupronickel known as baitong was used there in bce this paktong white copper was exported to britain as early as the th century but the nickel content of this alloy was not discovered until coins of nickel copper alloy were minted by bactrian kings agathocles euthydemus ii and pantaleon in the nd century bce possibly out of the chinese cupronickel in medieval germany a metallic yellow mineral was found in the erzgebirge ore mountains that resembled copper ore but when miners were unable to get any copper from it they blamed a mischievous sprite of german mythology nickel similar to old nick for besetting the copper they called this ore kupfernickel from german kupfer copper this ore is now known as the mineral nickeline formerly niccolite a nickel arsenide in baron axel fredrik cronstedt tried to extract copper from kupfernickel at a cobalt mine in the village of los sweden and instead produced a white metal that he named nickel after the spirit that had given its name to the mineral in modern german kupfernickel or kupfer nickel designates the alloy cupronickel originally the only source for nickel was the rare kupfernickel beginning in nickel was obtained as a byproduct of cobalt blue production the first large scale smelting of nickel began in norway in from nickel rich pyrrhotite the introduction of nickel in steel production in increased the demand for nickel the nickel deposits of new caledonia discovered in provided most of the world s supply between and the discovery of the large deposits in the sudbury basin canada in in norilsk talnakh russia in and in the merensky reef south africa in made large scale nickel production possible coinage aside from the aforementioned bactrian coins nickel was not a component of coins until the mid th century canada nickel five cent coins were struck in canada the world s largest nickel producer at the time during non war years from to the metal content made these coins magnetic during the war years most or all nickel was removed from canadian and us coins to save it for making armor canada used nickel from in its higher value coins until switzerland coins of nearly pure nickel were first used in in switzerland united kingdom birmingham forged nickel coins in c for trading in malaysia united states in the united states the term nickel or nick originally applied to the copper nickel flying eagle cent which replaced copper with nickel then the indian head cent of the same alloy from to still later in the term designated the three cent nickel with nickel increased to in the five cent shield nickel nickel copper appropriated the designation which has been used ever since for the subsequent cent pieces this alloy proportion is not ferromagnetic the us nickel coin contains ounces g of nickel which at the april price was worth cents along with grams of copper worth about cents with a total metal value of more than cents since the face value of a nickel is cents this made it an attractive target for melting by people wanting to sell the metals at a profit the united states mint anticipating this practice implemented new interim rules on december subject to public comment for days which criminalized the melting and export of cents and nickels violators can be punished with a fine of up to and or a maximum of five years in prison as of september the melt value of a us nickel copper and nickel included is of the face value current use in the st century the high price of nickel has led to some replacement of the metal in coins around the world coins still made with nickel alloys include one and two euro coins and u s coins and p p and uk coins from on the nickel alloy used for p and p uk coins was replaced with nickel plated steel this ignited a public controversy regarding the problems of people with nickel allergy world production an estimated million tonnes t of nickel per year are mined worldwide indonesia t the philippines t russia t new caledonia france t australia t and canada t are the largest producers as of the largest nickel deposits in non russian europe are in finland and greece identified land based sources averaging at least nickel contain at least million tonnes of nickel about is in laterites and is in sulfide deposits also extensive nickel sources are found in the depths of the pacific ocean especially in an area called the clarion clipperton zone in the form of polymetallic nodules peppering the seafloor at km below sea level these nodules are composed of numerous rare earth metals and are estimated to be nickel with advances in science and engineering regulation is currently being set in place by the international seabed authority to ensure that these nodules are collected in an environmentally conscientious manner while adhering to the united nations sustainable development goals the one place in the united states where nickel has been profitably mined is riddle oregon with several square miles of nickel bearing garnierite surface deposits the mine closed in the eagle mine project is a new nickel mine in michigan s upper peninsula construction was completed in and operations began in the third quarter of in the first full year of operation the eagle mine produced t production nickel is obtained through extractive metallurgy it is extracted from ore by conventional roasting and reduction processes that yield metal of greater than purity in many stainless steel applications pure nickel can be used without further purification depending on impurities traditionally most sulfide ores are processed using pyrometallurgical techniques to produce a matte for further refining recent advances in hydrometallurgical techniques result in significantly purer metallic nickel product most sulfide deposits have traditionally been processed by concentration through a froth flotation process followed by pyrometallurgical extraction in hydrometallurgical processes nickel sulfide ores are concentrated with flotation differential flotation if ni fe ratio is too low and then smelted the nickel matte is further processed with the sherritt gordon process first copper is removed by adding hydrogen sulfide leaving a concentrate of cobalt and nickel then solvent extraction is used to separate the cobalt and nickel with the final nickel content greater than electrorefining a second common refining process is leaching the metal matte into a nickel salt solution followed by electrowinning the nickel from solution by plating it onto a cathode as electrolytic nickel mond process the purest metal is obtained from nickel oxide by the mond process which gives a purity of over the process was patented by ludwig mond and has been in industrial use since before the beginning of the th century in this process nickel is reacted with carbon monoxide in the presence of a sulfur catalyst at around c to form nickel carbonyl in a similar reaction with iron iron pentacarbonyl can form though this reaction is slow if necessary the nickel may be separated by distillation dicobalt octacarbonyl is also formed in nickel distillation as a by product but it decomposes to tetracobalt dodecacarbonyl at the reaction temperature to give a non volatile solid nickel is obtained from nickel carbonyl by one of two processes it may be passed through a large chamber at high temperatures in which tens of thousands of nickel spheres pellets are constantly stirred the carbonyl decomposes and deposits pure nickel onto the spheres in the alternate process nickel carbonyl is decomposed in a smaller chamber at c to create a fine nickel powder the byproduct carbon monoxide is recirculated and reused the highly pure nickel product is known as carbonyl nickel market value the market price of nickel surged throughout and the early months of as of april the metal was trading at us tonne or oz the price later fell dramatically as of september the metal was trading at tonne or oz during the russian invasion of ukraine worries about sanctions on russian nickel exports triggered a short squeeze causing the price of nickel to quadruple in just two days reaching us per tonne the london metal exchange cancelled contracts worth billion and suspended nickel trading for over a week analyst andy home argued that such price shocks are exacerbated by the purity requirements imposed by metal markets only grade i pure metal can be used as a commodity on the exchanges but most of the world s supply is either in ferro nickel alloys or lower grade purities applications global use of nickel is currently in stainless steel in nonferrous alloys electroplating alloy steel foundries and other including batteries nickel is used in many recognizable industrial and consumer products including stainless steel alnico magnets coinage rechargeable batteries e g nickel iron electric guitar strings microphone capsules plating on plumbing fixtures and special alloys such as permalloy elinvar and invar it is used for plating and as a green tint in glass nickel is preeminently an alloy metal and its chief use is in nickel steels and nickel cast irons in which it typically increases the tensile strength toughness and elastic limit it is widely used in many other alloys including nickel brasses and bronzes and alloys with copper chromium aluminium lead cobalt silver and gold inconel incoloy monel nimonic because nickel is resistant to corrosion it was occasionally used as a substitute for decorative silver nickel was also occasionally used in some countries after as a cheap coinage metal see above but in the later years of the th century it was replaced by cheaper stainless steel i e iron alloys except in the united states and canada nickel is an excellent alloying agent for certain precious metals and is used in the fire assay as a collector of platinum group elements pge as such nickel can fully collect all six pges from ores and can partially collect gold high throughput nickel mines may also do pge recovery mainly platinum and palladium examples are norilsk russia and the sudbury basin canada nickel foam or nickel mesh is used in gas diffusion electrodes for alkaline fuel cells nickel and its alloys are often used as catalysts for hydrogenation reactions raney nickel a finely divided nickel aluminium alloy is one common form though related catalysts are also used including raney type catalysts nickel is naturally magnetostrictive in the presence of a magnetic field the material undergoes a small change in length the magnetostriction of nickel is on the order of ppm and is negative indicating that it contracts nickel is used as a binder in the cemented tungsten carbide or hardmetal industry and used in proportions of to by weight nickel makes the tungsten carbide magnetic and adds corrosion resistance to the cemented parts though the hardness is less than those with cobalt binder ni with half life years is useful in krytron devices as a beta particle high speed electron emitter to make ionization by the keep alive electrode more reliable it is being investigated as a power source for betavoltaic batteries around of all nickel production is used for engineering for building and construction for tubular products for metal goods for transport for electronic goods and for other uses raney nickel is widely used for hydrogenation of unsaturated oils to make margarine and substandard margarine and leftover oil may contain nickel as a contaminant forte et al found that type diabetic patients have ng ml of ni in the blood relative to ng ml in control subjects biological role it was not recognized until the s but nickel is known to play an important role in the biology of some plants bacteria archaea and fungi nickel enzymes such as urease are considered virulence factors in some organisms urease catalyzes hydrolysis of urea to form ammonia and carbamate nife hydrogenases can catalyze oxidation of h to form protons and electrons and also the reverse reaction the reduction of protons to form hydrogen gas a nickel tetrapyrrole coenzyme cofactor f is present in methyl coenzyme m reductase which can catalyze the formation of methane or the reverse reaction in methanogenic archaea in oxidation state one of the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase enzymes consists of an fe ni s cluster other nickel bearing enzymes include a rare bacterial class of superoxide dismutase and glyoxalase i enzymes in bacteria and several eukaryotic trypanosomal parasites in other organisms including yeast and mammals this enzyme contains divalent zn dietary nickel may affect human health through infections by nickel dependent bacteria but nickel may also be an essential nutrient for bacteria living in the large intestine in effect functioning as a prebiotic the us institute of medicine has not confirmed that nickel is an essential nutrient for humans so neither a recommended dietary allowance rda nor an adequate intake have been established the tolerable upper intake level of dietary nickel is mg day as soluble nickel salts estimated dietary intake is to g day less than is absorbed what is absorbed is excreted in urine relatively large amounts of nickel comparable to the estimated average ingestion above leach into food cooked in stainless steel for example the amount of nickel leached after cooking cycles into one serving of tomato sauce averages g nickel released from siberian traps volcanic eruptions is suspected of helping the growth of methanosarcina a genus of euryarchaeote archaea that produced methane in the permian triassic extinction event the biggest known mass extinction toxicity the major source of nickel exposure is oral consumption as nickel is essential to plants typical background concentrations of nickel do not exceed ng m in air mg kg in soil mg kg in vegetation g l in freshwater and g l in seawater environmental concentrations may be increased by human pollution for example nickel plated faucets may contaminate water and soil mining and smelting may dump nickel into wastewater nickel steel alloy cookware and nickel pigmented dishes may release nickel into food air may be polluted by nickel ore refining and fossil fuel combustion humans may absorb nickel directly from tobacco smoke and skin contact with jewelry shampoos detergents and coins a less common form of chronic exposure is through hemodialysis as traces of nickel ions may be absorbed into the plasma from the chelating action of albumin the average daily exposure is not a threat to human health most nickel absorbed by humans is removed by the kidneys and passed out of the body through urine or is eliminated through the gastrointestinal tract without being absorbed nickel is not a cumulative poison but larger doses or chronic inhalation exposure may be toxic even carcinogenic and constitute an occupational hazard nickel compounds are classified as human carcinogens based on increased respiratory cancer risks observed in epidemiological studies of sulfidic ore refinery workers this is supported by the positive results of the ntp bioassays with ni sub sulfide and ni oxide in rats and mice the human and animal data consistently indicate a lack of carcinogenicity via the oral route of exposure and limit the carcinogenicity of nickel compounds to respiratory tumours after inhalation nickel metal is classified as a suspect carcinogen there is consistency between the absence of increased respiratory cancer risks in workers predominantly exposed to metallic nickel and the lack of respiratory tumours in a rat lifetime inhalation carcinogenicity study with nickel metal powder in the rodent inhalation studies with various nickel compounds and nickel metal increased lung inflammations with and without bronchial lymph node hyperplasia or fibrosis were observed in rat studies oral ingestion of water soluble nickel salts can trigger perinatal mortality in pregnant animals whether these effects are relevant to humans is unclear as epidemiological studies of highly exposed female workers have not shown adverse developmental toxicity effects people can be exposed to nickel in the workplace by inhalation ingestion and contact with skin or eye the occupational safety and health administration osha has set the legal limit permissible exposure limit for the workplace at mg m per hour workday excluding nickel carbonyl the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh sets the recommended exposure limit rel at mg m per hour workday at mg m nickel is immediately dangerous to life and health nickel carbonyl ni co is an extremely toxic gas the toxicity of metal carbonyls is a function of both the toxicity of the metal and the off gassing of carbon monoxide from the carbonyl functional groups nickel carbonyl is also explosive in air sensitized persons may show a skin contact allergy to nickel known as a contact dermatitis highly sensitized persons may also react to foods with high nickel content patients with pompholyx may also be sensitive to nickel nickel is the top confirmed contact allergen worldwide partly due to its use in jewelry for pierced ears nickel allergies affecting pierced ears are often marked by itchy red skin many earrings are now made without nickel or with low release nickel to address this problem the amount allowed in products that contact human skin is now regulated by the european union in researchers found that the nickel released by and euro coins far exceeded those standards this is believed to be due to a galvanic reaction nickel was voted allergen of the year in by the american contact dermatitis society in august the american academy of dermatology adopted a position statement on the safety of nickel estimates suggest that contact dermatitis which includes nickel sensitization accounts for approximately billion and affects nearly million people reports show that both the nickel induced activation of hypoxia inducible factor hif and the up regulation of hypoxia inducible genes are caused by depletion of intracellular ascorbate the addition of ascorbate to the culture medium increased the intracellular ascorbate level and reversed both the metal induced stabilization of hif and hif dependent gene expression ,28
Copper,Cu,copper is a chemical element with the symbol cu from latin cuprum and atomic number it is a soft malleable and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity a freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish orange color copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity as a building material and as a constituent of various metal alloys such as sterling silver used in jewelry cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form native metals this led to very early human use in several regions from circa bc thousands of years later it was the first metal to be smelted from sulfide ores circa bc the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold c bc and the first metal to be purposely alloyed with another metal tin to create bronze c bc in the roman era copper was mined principally on cyprus the origin of the name of the metal from aes cyprium metal of cyprus later corrupted to cuprum latin coper old english and copper were derived from this the later spelling first used around commonly encountered compounds are copper ii salts which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite malachite and turquoise and have been used widely and historically as pigments copper used in buildings usually for roofing oxidizes to form a green verdigris or patina copper is sometimes used in decorative art both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents fungicides and wood preservatives copper is essential to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral because it is a key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase in molluscs and crustaceans copper is a constituent of the blood pigment hemocyanin replaced by the iron complexed hemoglobin in fish and other vertebrates in humans copper is found mainly in the liver muscle and bone the adult body contains between and mg of copper per kilogram of body weight characteristics physical copper silver and gold are in group of the periodic table these three metals have one s orbital electron on top of a filled d electron shell and are characterized by high ductility and electrical and thermal conductivity the filled d shells in these elements contribute little to interatomic interactions which are dominated by the s electrons through metallic bonds unlike metals with incomplete d shells metallic bonds in copper are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak this observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper at the macroscopic scale introduction of extended defects to the crystal lattice such as grain boundaries hinders flow of the material under applied stress thereby increasing its hardness for this reason copper is usually supplied in a fine grained polycrystalline form which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms the softness of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity s m and high thermal conductivity second highest second only to silver among pure metals at room temperature this is because the resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice which are relatively weak in a soft metal the maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately a m of cross sectional area above which it begins to heat excessively copper is one of a few metallic elements with a natural color other than gray or silver pure copper is orange red and acquires a reddish tarnish when exposed to air the characteristic color of copper results from the electronic transitions between the filled d and half empty s atomic shells the energy difference between these shells corresponds to orange light as with other metals if copper is put in contact with another metal galvanic corrosion will occur chemical copper does not react with water but it does slowly react with atmospheric oxygen to form a layer of brown black copper oxide which unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air protects the underlying metal from further corrosion passivation a green layer of verdigris copper carbonate can often be seen on old copper structures such as the roofing of many older buildings and the statue of liberty copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides isotopes there are isotopes of copper cu and cu are stable with cu comprising approximately of naturally occurring copper both have a spin of the other isotopes are radioactive with the most stable being cu with a half life of hours seven metastable isotopes have been characterized mcu is the longest lived with a half life of minutes isotopes with a mass number above decay by whereas those with a mass number below decay by cu which has a half life of hours decays both ways cu and cu have significant applications cu is used in cucu ptsm as a radioactive tracer for positron emission tomography occurrence copper is produced in massive stars and is present in the earth s crust in a proportion of about parts per million ppm in nature copper occurs in a variety of minerals including native copper copper sulfides such as chalcopyrite bornite digenite covellite and chalcocite copper sulfosalts such as tetrahedite tennantite and enargite copper carbonates such as azurite and malachite and as copper i or copper ii oxides such as cuprite and tenorite respectively the largest mass of elemental copper discovered weighed tonnes and was found in on the keweenaw peninsula in michigan us native copper is a polycrystal with the largest single crystal ever described measuring cm copper is the th most abundant element in earth s crust representing ppm compared with ppm for zinc and ppm for lead typical background concentrations of copper do not exceed ng m in the atmosphere mg kg in soil mg kg in vegetation g l in freshwater and g l in seawater production most copper is mined or extracted as copper sulfides from large open pit mines in porphyry copper deposits that contain to copper sites include chuquicamata in chile bingham canyon mine in utah united states and el chino mine in new mexico united states according to the british geological survey in chile was the top producer of copper with at least one third of the world share followed by the united states indonesia and peru copper can also be recovered through the in situ leach process several sites in the state of arizona are considered prime candidates for this method the amount of copper in use is increasing and the quantity available is barely sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage an alternative source of copper for collection currently being researched are polymetallic nodules which are located at the depths of the pacific ocean approximately meters below sea level these nodules contain other valuable metals such as cobalt and nickel reserves and prices copper has been in use at least years but more than of all copper ever mined and smelted has been extracted since as with many natural resources the total amount of copper on earth is vast with around tons in the top kilometer of earth s crust which is about million years worth at the current rate of extraction however only a tiny fraction of these reserves is economically viable with present day prices and technologies estimates of copper reserves available for mining vary from to years depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate recycling is a major source of copper in the modern world because of these and other factors the future of copper production and supply is the subject of much debate including the concept of peak copper analogous to peak oil the price of copper has historically been unstable and its price increased from the year low of us lb us kg in june to per pound kg in may it dropped to lb kg in february then rebounded to lb kg in april in february weakening global demand and a steep fall in commodity prices since the previous year s highs left copper prices at lb kg between september and february the price of copper rose from a metric ton to a metric ton methods the concentration of copper in ores averages only and most commercial ores are sulfides especially chalcopyrite cufes bornite cu fes and to a lesser extent covellite cus and chalcocite cu s conversely the average concentration of copper in polymetallic nodules is estimated at the methods of extracting copper as well as other metals found in these nodules include sulphuric leaching smelting and an application of the cuprion process for minerals found in land ores they are concentrated from crushed ores to the level of copper by froth flotation or bioleaching heating this material with silica in flash smelting removes much of the iron as slag the process exploits the greater ease of converting iron sulfides into oxides which in turn react with the silica to form the silicate slag that floats on top of the heated mass the resulting copper matte consisting of cu s is roasted to convert the sulfides into oxides cu s o cu o so the cuprous oxide reacts with cuprous sulfide to converted to blister copper upon heating cu o cu s cu so the sudbury matte process converted only half the sulfide to oxide and then used this oxide to remove the rest of the sulfur as oxide it was then electrolytically refined and the anode mud exploited for the platinum and gold it contained this step exploits the relatively easy reduction of copper oxides to copper metal natural gas is blown across the blister to remove most of the remaining oxygen and electrorefining is performed on the resulting material to produce pure copper cu e cu recycling like aluminium copper is recyclable without any loss of quality both from raw state and from manufactured products in volume copper is the third most recycled metal after iron and aluminium an estimated of all copper ever mined is still in use today according to the international resource panel s metal stocks in society report the global per capita stock of copper in use in society is kg much of this is in more developed countries kg per capita rather than less developed countries kg per capita the process of recycling copper is roughly the same as is used to extract copper but requires fewer steps high purity scrap copper is melted in a furnace and then reduced and cast into billets and ingots lower purity scrap is refined by electroplating in a bath of sulfuric acid alloys numerous copper alloys have been formulated many with important uses brass is an alloy of copper and zinc bronze usually refers to copper tin alloys but can refer to any alloy of copper such as aluminium bronze copper is one of the most important constituents of silver and karat gold solders used in the jewelry industry modifying the color hardness and melting point of the resulting alloys some lead free solders consist of tin alloyed with a small proportion of copper and other metals the alloy of copper and nickel called cupronickel is used in low denomination coins often for the outer cladding the us five cent coin currently called a nickel consists of copper and nickel in homogeneous composition prior to the introduction of cupronickel which was widely adopted by countries in the latter half of the th century alloys of copper and silver were also used with the united states using an alloy of silver and copper until when circulating silver was removed from all coins with the exception of the half dollar these were debased to an alloy of silver and copper between and the alloy of copper and nickel remarkable for its resistance to corrosion is used for various objects exposed to seawater though it is vulnerable to the sulfides sometimes found in polluted harbors and estuaries alloys of copper with aluminium about have a golden color and are used in decorations shakud is a japanese decorative alloy of copper containing a low percentage of gold typically that can be patinated to a dark blue or black color compounds copper forms a rich variety of compounds usually with oxidation states and which are often called cuprous and cupric respectively copper compounds whether organic complexes or organometallics promote or catalyse numerous chemical and biological processes binary compounds as with other elements the simplest compounds of copper are binary compounds i e those containing only two elements the principal examples being oxides sulfides and halides both cuprous and cupric oxides are known among the numerous copper sulfides important examples include copper i sulfide and copper ii sulfide cuprous halides with fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine are known as are cupric halides with fluorine chlorine and bromine attempts to prepare copper ii iodide yield only copper i iodide and iodine cu i cui i coordination chemistry copper forms coordination complexes with ligands in aqueous solution copper ii exists as cu h o this complex exhibits the fastest water exchange rate speed of water ligands attaching and detaching for any transition metal aquo complex adding aqueous sodium hydroxide causes the precipitation of light blue solid copper ii hydroxide a simplified equation is cu oh cu oh aqueous ammonia results in the same precipitate upon adding excess ammonia the precipitate dissolves forming tetraamminecopper ii cu h o oh nh cu h o nh h o oh many other oxyanions form complexes these include copper ii acetate copper ii nitrate and copper ii carbonate copper ii sulfate forms a blue crystalline pentahydrate the most familiar copper compound in the laboratory it is used in a fungicide called the bordeaux mixture polyols compounds containing more than one alcohol functional group generally interact with cupric salts for example copper salts are used to test for reducing sugars specifically using benedict s reagent and fehling s solution the presence of the sugar is signaled by a color change from blue cu ii to reddish copper i oxide schweizer s reagent and related complexes with ethylenediamine and other amines dissolve cellulose amino acids form very stable chelate complexes with copper ii including in the form of metal organic biohybrids mobs many wet chemical tests for copper ions exist one involving potassium ferrocyanide which gives a brown precipitate with copper ii salts organocopper chemistry compounds that contain a carbon copper bond are known as organocopper compounds they are very reactive towards oxygen to form copper i oxide and have many uses in chemistry they are synthesized by treating copper i compounds with grignard reagents terminal alkynes or organolithium reagents in particular the last reaction described produces a gilman reagent these can undergo substitution with alkyl halides to form coupling products as such they are important in the field of organic synthesis copper i acetylide is highly shock sensitive but is an intermediate in reactions such as the cadiot chodkiewicz coupling and the sonogashira coupling conjugate addition to enones and carbocupration of alkynes can also be achieved with organocopper compounds copper i forms a variety of weak complexes with alkenes and carbon monoxide especially in the presence of amine ligands copper iii and copper iv copper iii is most often found in oxides a simple example is potassium cuprate kcuo a blue black solid the most extensively studied copper iii compounds are the cuprate superconductors yttrium barium copper oxide yba cu o consists of both cu ii and cu iii centres like oxide fluoride is a highly basic anion and is known to stabilize metal ions in high oxidation states both copper iii and even copper iv fluorides are known k cuf and cs cuf respectively some copper proteins form oxo complexes which also feature copper iii with tetrapeptides purple colored copper iii complexes are stabilized by the deprotonated amide ligands complexes of copper iii are also found as intermediates in reactions of organocopper compounds for example in the kharasch sosnovsky reaction history a timeline of copper illustrates how this metal has advanced human civilization for the past years prehistoric copper age copper occurs naturally as native metallic copper and was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record the history of copper use dates to bc in the middle east a copper pendant was found in northern iraq that dates to bc evidence suggests that gold and meteoric iron but not smelted iron were the only metals used by humans before copper the history of copper metallurgy is thought to follow this sequence first cold working of native copper then annealing smelting and finally lost wax casting in southeastern anatolia all four of these techniques appear more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the neolithic c bc copper smelting was independently invented in different places it was probably discovered in china before bc in central america around ad and in west africa about the th or th century ad investment casting was invented in bc in southeast asia and carbon dating has established mining at alderley edge in cheshire uk at to bc tzi the iceman a male dated from to bc was found with an axe with a copper head pure high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest an involvement in copper smelting experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals in particular copper smelting led to the discovery of iron smelting production in the old copper complex in michigan and wisconsin is dated between and bc natural bronze a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon arsenic and rarely tin came into general use in the balkans around bc bronze age alloying copper with tin to make bronze was first practiced about years after the discovery of copper smelting and about years after natural bronze had come into general use bronze artifacts from the vin a culture date to bc sumerian and egyptian artifacts of copper and bronze alloys date to bc the bronze age began in southeastern europe around bc in northwestern europe about bc it ended with the beginning of the iron age bc in the near east and bc in northern europe the transition between the neolithic period and the bronze age was formerly termed the chalcolithic period copper stone when copper tools were used with stone tools the term has gradually fallen out of favor because in some parts of the world the chalcolithic and neolithic are coterminous at both ends brass an alloy of copper and zinc is of much more recent origin it was known to the greeks but became a significant supplement to bronze during the roman empire ancient and post classical in greece copper was known by the name chalkos it was an important resource for the romans greeks and other ancient peoples in roman times it was known as aes cyprium aes being the generic latin term for copper alloys and cyprium from cyprus where much copper was mined the phrase was simplified to cuprum hence the english copper aphrodite venus in rome represented copper in mythology and alchemy because of its lustrous beauty and its ancient use in producing mirrors cyprus the source of copper was sacred to the goddess the seven heavenly bodies known to the ancients were associated with the seven metals known in antiquity and venus was assigned to copper both because of the connection to the goddess and because venus was the brightest heavenly body after the sun and moon and so corresponded to the most lustrous and desirable metal after gold and silver copper was first mined in ancient britain as early as bc mining at the largest of these mines the great orme continued into the late bronze age mining seems to have been largely restricted to supergene ores which were easier to smelt the rich copper deposits of cornwall seem to have been largely untouched in spite of extensive tin mining in the region for reasons likely social and political rather than technological in north america copper mining began with marginal workings by native americans native copper is known to have been extracted from sites on isle royale with primitive stone tools between and copper metallurgy was flourishing in south america particularly in peru around ad copper burial ornamentals from the th century have been uncovered but the metal s commercial production did not start until the early th century the cultural role of copper has been important particularly in currency romans in the th through rd centuries bc used copper lumps as money at first the copper itself was valued but gradually the shape and look of the copper became more important julius caesar had his own coins made from brass while octavianus augustus caesar s coins were made from cu pb sn alloys with an estimated annual output of around t roman copper mining and smelting activities reached a scale unsurpassed until the time of the industrial revolution the provinces most intensely mined were those of hispania cyprus and in central europe the gates of the temple of jerusalem used corinthian bronze treated with depletion gilding the process was most prevalent in alexandria where alchemy is thought to have begun in ancient india copper was used in the holistic medical science ayurveda for surgical instruments and other medical equipment ancient egyptians bc used copper for sterilizing wounds and drinking water and later to treat headaches burns and itching modern the great copper mountain was a mine in falun sweden that operated from the th century to it satisfied two thirds of europe s copper consumption in the th century and helped fund many of sweden s wars during that time it was referred to as the nation s treasury sweden had a copper backed currency copper is used in roofing currency and for photographic technology known as the daguerreotype copper was used in renaissance sculpture and was used to construct the statue of liberty copper continues to be used in construction of various types copper plating and copper sheathing were widely used to protect the under water hulls of ships a technique pioneered by the british admiralty in the th century the norddeutsche affinerie in hamburg was the first modern electroplating plant starting its production in the german scientist gottfried osann invented powder metallurgy in while determining the metal s atomic mass around then it was discovered that the amount and type of alloying element e g tin to copper would affect bell tones during the rise in demand for copper for the age of electricity from the s until the great depression of the s the united states produced one third to half the world s newly mined copper major districts included the keweenaw district of northern michigan primarily native copper deposits which was eclipsed by the vast sulphide deposits of butte montana in the late s which itself was eclipsed by porphyry deposits of the souhwest united states especially at bingham canyon utah and morenci arizona introduction of open pit steam shovel mining and innovations in smelting refining flotation concentration and other processing steps led to mass production early in the twentieth century arizona ranked first followed by montana then utah and michigan flash smelting was developed by outokumpu in finland and first applied at harjavalta in the energy efficient process accounts for of the world s primary copper production the intergovernmental council of copper exporting countries formed in by chile peru zaire and zambia operated in the copper market as opec does in oil though it never achieved the same influence particularly because the second largest producer the united states was never a member it was dissolved in applications the major applications of copper are electrical wire roofing and plumbing and industrial machinery copper is used mostly as a pure metal but when greater hardness is required it is put into such alloys as brass and bronze of total use for more than two centuries copper paint has been used on boat hulls to control the growth of plants and shellfish a small part of the copper supply is used for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture machining of copper is possible although alloys are preferred for good machinability in creating intricate parts wire and cable despite competition from other materials copper remains the preferred electrical conductor in nearly all categories of electrical wiring except overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred copper wire is used in power generation power transmission power distribution telecommunications electronics circuitry and countless types of electrical equipment electrical wiring is the most important market for the copper industry this includes structural power wiring power distribution cable appliance wire communications cable automotive wire and cable and magnet wire roughly half of all copper mined is used for electrical wire and cable conductors many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties such as its high electrical conductivity tensile strength ductility creep deformation resistance corrosion resistance low thermal expansion high thermal conductivity ease of soldering malleability and ease of installation for a short period from the late s to the late s copper wiring was replaced by aluminium wiring in many housing construction projects in america the new wiring was implicated in a number of house fires and the industry returned to copper electronics and related devices integrated circuits and printed circuit boards increasingly feature copper in place of aluminium because of its superior electrical conductivity heat sinks and heat exchangers use copper because of its superior heat dissipation properties electromagnets vacuum tubes cathode ray tubes and magnetrons in microwave ovens use copper as do waveguides for microwave radiation electric motors copper s superior conductivity enhances the efficiency of electrical motors this is important because motors and motor driven systems account for of all global electricity consumption and of all electricity used by industry increasing the mass and cross section of copper in a coil increases the efficiency of the motor copper motor rotors a new technology designed for motor applications where energy savings are prime design objectives are enabling general purpose induction motors to meet and exceed national electrical manufacturers association nema premium efficiency standards renewable energy production architecture copper has been used since ancient times as a durable corrosion resistant and weatherproof architectural material roofs flashings rain gutters downspouts domes spires vaults and doors have been made from copper for hundreds or thousands of years copper s architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding building expansion joints radio frequency shielding and antimicrobial and decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails bathroom fixtures and counter tops some of copper s other important benefits as an architectural material include low thermal movement light weight lightning protection and recyclability the metal s distinctive natural green patina has long been coveted by architects and designers the final patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion thereby protecting the underlying metal against further weathering it can be a mixture of carbonate and sulfate compounds in various amounts depending upon environmental conditions such as sulfur containing acid rain architectural copper and its alloys can also be finished to take on a particular look feel or color finishes include mechanical surface treatments chemical coloring and coatings copper has excellent brazing and soldering properties and can be welded the best results are obtained with gas metal arc welding antibiofouling copper is biostatic meaning bacteria and many other forms of life will not grow on it for this reason it has long been used to line parts of ships to protect against barnacles and mussels it was originally used pure but has since been superseded by muntz metal and copper based paint similarly as discussed in copper alloys in aquaculture copper alloys have become important netting materials in the aquaculture industry because they are antimicrobial and prevent biofouling even in extreme conditions and have strong structural and corrosion resistant properties in marine environments antimicrobial copper alloy touch surfaces have natural properties that destroy a wide range of microorganisms e g e coli o h methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa staphylococcus clostridium difficile influenza a virus adenovirus sars cov and fungi indians have been using copper vessels since ancient times for storing water even before modern science realized its antimicrobial properties some copper alloys were proven to kill more than of disease causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly the united states environmental protection agency epa has approved the registrations of these copper alloys as antimicrobial materials with public health benefits that approval allows manufacturers to make legal claims to the public health benefits of products made of registered alloys in addition the epa has approved a long list of antimicrobial copper products made from these alloys such as bedrails handrails over bed tables sinks faucets door knobs toilet hardware computer keyboards health club equipment and shopping cart handles for a comprehensive list see antimicrobial copper alloy touch surfaces approved products copper doorknobs are used by hospitals to reduce the transfer of disease and legionnaires disease is suppressed by copper tubing in plumbing systems antimicrobial copper alloy products are now being installed in healthcare facilities in the u k ireland japan korea france denmark and brazil as well as being called for in the us and in the subway transit system in santiago chile where copper zinc alloy handrails were installed in some stations between and textile fibers can be blended with copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics speculative investing copper may be used as a speculative investment due to the predicted increase in use from worldwide infrastructure growth and the important role it has in producing wind turbines solar panels and other renewable energy sources another reason predicted demand increases is the fact that electric cars contain an average of times as much copper as conventional cars although the effect of electric cars on copper demand is debated some people invest in copper through copper mining stocks etfs and futures others store physical copper in the form of copper bars or rounds although these tend to carry a higher premium in comparison to precious metals those who want to avoid the premiums of copper bullion alternatively store old copper wire copper tubing or american pennies made before folk medicine copper is commonly used in jewelry and according to some folklore copper bracelets relieve arthritis symptoms in one trial for osteoarthritis and one trial for rheumatoid arthritis no differences is found between copper bracelet and control non copper bracelet no evidence shows that copper can be absorbed through the skin if it were it might lead to copper poisoning compression clothing recently some compression clothing with inter woven copper has been marketed with health claims similar to the folk medicine claims because compression clothing is a valid treatment for some ailments the clothing may have that benefit but the added copper may have no benefit beyond a placebo effect degradation chromobacterium violaceum and pseudomonas fluorescens can both mobilize solid copper as a cyanide compound the ericoid mycorrhizal fungi associated with calluna erica and vaccinium can grow in metalliferous soils containing copper the ectomycorrhizal fungus suillus luteus protects young pine trees from copper toxicity a sample of the fungus aspergillus niger was found growing from gold mining solution and was found to contain cyano complexes of such metals as gold silver copper iron and zinc the fungus also plays a role in the solubilization of heavy metal sulfides biological role biochemistry copper proteins have diverse roles in biological electron transport and oxygen transportation processes that exploit the easy interconversion of cu i and cu ii copper is essential in the aerobic respiration of all eukaryotes in mitochondria it is found in cytochrome c oxidase which is the last protein in oxidative phosphorylation cytochrome c oxidase is the protein that binds the o between a copper and an iron the protein transfers electrons to the o molecule to reduce it to two molecules of water copper is also found in many superoxide dismutases proteins that catalyze the decomposition of superoxides by converting it by disproportionation to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide cu sod o cu sod o reduction of copper oxidation of superoxide cu sod o h cu sod h o oxidation of copper reduction of superoxide the protein hemocyanin is the oxygen carrier in most mollusks and some arthropods such as the horseshoe crab limulus polyphemus because hemocyanin is blue these organisms have blue blood rather than the red blood of iron based hemoglobin structurally related to hemocyanin are the laccases and tyrosinases instead of reversibly binding oxygen these proteins hydroxylate substrates illustrated by their role in the formation of lacquers the biological role for copper commenced with the appearance of oxygen in earth s atmosphere several copper proteins such as the blue copper proteins do not interact directly with substrates hence they are not enzymes these proteins relay electrons by the process called electron transfer a unique tetranuclear copper center has been found in nitrous oxide reductase chemical compounds which were developed for treatment of wilson s disease have been investigated for use in cancer therapy nutrition copper is an essential trace element in plants and animals but not all microorganisms the human body contains copper at a level of about to mg per kg of body mass absorption copper is absorbed in the gut then transported to the liver bound to albumin after processing in the liver copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase which involves the protein ceruloplasmin carrying the majority of copper in blood ceruloplasmin also carries the copper that is excreted in milk and is particularly well absorbed as a copper source copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation about mg a day vs about mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body and the body is able to excrete some excess copper if needed via bile which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine dietary recommendations the u s institute of medicine iom updated the estimated average requirements ears and recommended dietary allowances rdas for copper in if there is not sufficient information to establish ears and rdas an estimate designated adequate intake ai is used instead the ais for copper are g of copper for month old males and females and g of copper for month old males and females for both sexes the rdas for copper are g of copper for years old g of copper for years old g of copper for years old g of copper for years old and g of copper for ages years and older for pregnancy g for lactation g as for safety the iom also sets tolerable upper intake levels uls for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient in the case of copper the ul is set at mg day collectively the ears rdas ais and uls are referred to as dietary reference intakes the european food safety authority efsa refers to the collective set of information as dietary reference values with population reference intake pri instead of rda and average requirement instead of ear ai and ul defined the same as in united states for women and men ages and older the ais are set at and mg day respectively ais for pregnancy and lactation is mg day for children ages years the ais increase with age from to mg day these ais are higher than the u s rdas the european food safety authority reviewed the same safety question and set its ul at mg day which is half the u s value for u s food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of daily value dv for copper labeling purposes of the daily value was mg but as of may it was revised to mg to bring it into agreement with the rda a table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at reference daily intake deficiency because of its role in facilitating iron uptake copper deficiency can produce anemia like symptoms neutropenia bone abnormalities hypopigmentation impaired growth increased incidence of infections osteoporosis hyperthyroidism and abnormalities in glucose and cholesterol metabolism conversely wilson s disease causes an accumulation of copper in body tissues severe deficiency can be found by testing for low plasma or serum copper levels low ceruloplasmin and low red blood cell superoxide dismutase levels these are not sensitive to marginal copper status the cytochrome c oxidase activity of leucocytes and platelets has been stated as another factor in deficiency but the results have not been confirmed by replication toxicity gram quantities of various copper salts have been taken in suicide attempts and produced acute copper toxicity in humans possibly due to redox cycling and the generation of reactive oxygen species that damage dna corresponding amounts of copper salts mg kg are toxic in animals a minimum dietary value for healthy growth in rabbits has been reported to be at least ppm in the diet however higher concentrations of copper ppm ppm or ppm in the diet of rabbits may favorably influence feed conversion efficiency growth rates and carcass dressing percentages chronic copper toxicity does not normally occur in humans because of transport systems that regulate absorption and excretion autosomal recessive mutations in copper transport proteins can disable these systems leading to wilson s disease with copper accumulation and cirrhosis of the liver in persons who have inherited two defective genes elevated copper levels have also been linked to worsening symptoms of alzheimer s disease human exposure in the us the occupational safety and health administration osha has designated a permissible exposure limit pel for copper dust and fumes in the workplace as a time weighted average twa of mg m the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit rel of mg m time weighted average the idlh immediately dangerous to life and health value is mg m copper is a constituent of tobacco smoke the tobacco plant readily absorbs and accumulates heavy metals such as copper from the surrounding soil into its leaves these are readily absorbed into the user s body following smoke inhalation the health implications are not clear ,29
Zinc,Zn,zinc is a chemical element with the symbol zn and atomic number zinc is a slightly brittle metal at room temperature and has a shiny greyish appearance when oxidation is removed it is the first element in group iib of the periodic table in some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state and the zn and mg ions are of similar size zinc is the th most abundant element in earth s crust and has five stable isotopes the most common zinc ore is sphalerite zinc blende a zinc sulfide mineral the largest workable lodes are in australia asia and the united states zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore roasting and final extraction using electricity electrowinning zinc is an essential trace element for humans animals plants and for microorganisms and is necessary for prenatal and postnatal development it is the second most abundant trace metal in humans after iron and it is the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes zinc is also an essential nutrient element for coral growth as it is an important cofactor for many enzymes zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases in children deficiency causes growth retardation delayed sexual maturation infection susceptibility and diarrhea enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans consumption of excess zinc may cause ataxia lethargy and copper deficiency brass an alloy of copper and zinc in various proportions was used as early as the third millennium bc in the aegean area and the region which currently includes iraq the united arab emirates kalmykia turkmenistan and georgia in the second millennium bc it was used in the regions currently including west india uzbekistan iran syria iraq and israel zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the th century in india though it was known to the ancient romans and greeks the mines of rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the th century bc to date the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from zawar in rajasthan as early as the th century ad when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called philosopher s wool or white snow the element was probably named by the alchemist paracelsus after the german word zinke prong tooth german chemist andreas sigismund marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in work by luigi galvani and alessandro volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by corrosion resistant zinc plating of iron hot dip galvanizing is the major application for zinc other applications are in electrical batteries small non structural castings and alloys such as brass a variety of zinc compounds are commonly used such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate as dietary supplements zinc chloride in deodorants zinc pyrithione anti dandruff shampoos zinc sulfide in luminescent paints and dimethylzinc or diethylzinc in the organic laboratory characteristics physical properties zinc is a bluish white lustrous diamagnetic metal though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish it is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure with a distorted form of hexagonal close packing in which each atom has six nearest neighbors at pm in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of pm the metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between and c above c the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating zinc is a fair conductor of electricity for a metal zinc has relatively low melting c and boiling point c the melting point is the lowest of all the d block metals aside from mercury and cadmium for this reason among others zinc cadmium and mercury are often not considered to be transition metals like the rest of the d block metals many alloys contain zinc including brass other metals long known to form binary alloys with zinc are aluminium antimony bismuth gold iron lead mercury silver tin magnesium cobalt nickel tellurium and sodium although neither zinc nor zirconium is ferromagnetic their alloy zrzn exhibits ferromagnetism below k occurrence zinc makes up about ppm of earth s crust making it the th most abundant element typical background concentrations of zinc do not exceed g m in the atmosphere mg kg in soil mg kg in vegetation g l in freshwater and g l in seawater the element is normally found in association with other base metals such as copper and lead in ores zinc is a chalcophile meaning the element is more likely to be found in minerals together with sulfur and other heavy chalcogens rather than with the light chalcogen oxygen or with non chalcogen electronegative elements such as the halogens sulfides formed as the crust solidified under the reducing conditions of the early earth s atmosphere sphalerite which is a form of zinc sulfide is the most heavily mined zinc containing ore because its concentrate contains zinc other source minerals for zinc include smithsonite zinc carbonate hemimorphite zinc silicate wurtzite another zinc sulfide and sometimes hydrozincite basic zinc carbonate with the exception of wurtzite all these other minerals were formed by weathering of the primordial zinc sulfides identified world zinc resources total about billion tonnes large deposits are in australia canada and the united states with the largest reserves in iran the most recent estimate of reserve base for zinc meets specified minimum physical criteria related to current mining and production practices was made in and calculated to be roughly mt zinc reserves on the other hand are geologically identified ore bodies whose suitability for recovery is economically based location grade quality and quantity at the time of determination since exploration and mine development is an ongoing process the amount of zinc reserves is not a fixed number and sustainability of zinc ore supplies cannot be judged by simply extrapolating the combined mine life of today s zinc mines this concept is well supported by data from the united states geological survey usgs which illustrates that although refined zinc production increased between and the reserve lifetime for zinc has remained unchanged about million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to and scholars have estimated that about million tonnes are in use isotopes five stable isotopes of zinc occur in nature with zn being the most abundant isotope natural abundance the other isotopes found in nature are zn zn zn and zn several dozen radioisotopes have been characterized zn which has a half life of days is the least active radioisotope followed by zn with a half life of hours zinc has nuclear isomers of which mzn has the longest half life h the superscript m indicates a metastable isotope the nucleus of a metastable isotope is in an excited state and will return to the ground state by emitting a photon in the form of a gamma ray zn has three excited metastable states and zn has two the isotopes zn zn zn and zn each have only one excited metastable state the most common decay mode of a radioisotope of zinc with a mass number lower than is electron capture the decay product resulting from electron capture is an isotope of copper n zn e n cuthe most common decay mode of a radioisotope of zinc with mass number higher than is beta decay which produces an isotope of gallium n zn n ga e e compounds and chemistry reactivity zinc has an electron configuration of ar d s and is a member of the group of the periodic table it is a moderately reactive metal and strong reducing agent the surface of the pure metal tarnishes quickly eventually forming a protective passivating layer of the basic zinc carbonate zn oh co by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide zinc burns in air with a bright bluish green flame giving off fumes of zinc oxide zinc reacts readily with acids alkalis and other non metals extremely pure zinc reacts only slowly at room temperature with acids strong acids such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid can remove the passivating layer and the subsequent reaction with the acid releases hydrogen gas the chemistry of zinc is dominated by the oxidation state when compounds in this oxidation state are formed the outer shell s electrons are lost yielding a bare zinc ion with the electronic configuration ar d in aqueous solution an octahedral complex zn h o is the predominant species the volatilization of zinc in combination with zinc chloride at temperatures above c indicates the formation of zn cl a zinc compound with a oxidation state no compounds of zinc in positive oxidation states other than or are known calculations indicate that a zinc compound with the oxidation state of is unlikely to exist zn iii is predicted to exist in the presence of strongly electronegative trianions however there exists some doubt around this possibility but in another compound was reported with more evidence that had the oxidation state of with the formula znbeb cn zinc chemistry is similar to the chemistry of the late first row transition metals nickel and copper though it has a filled d shell and compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless the ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical because of this some of the equivalent salts have the same crystal structure and in other circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor the chemistry of zinc has much in common with that of magnesium in other respects there is little similarity with the late first row transition metals zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and much more stable complexes with n and s donors complexes of zinc are mostly or coordinate although coordinate complexes are known zinc i compounds zinc i compounds are very rare the zn ion is implicated by the formation of a yellow diamagnetic glass by dissolving metallic zinc in molten zncl the zn core would be analogous to the hg cation present in

the presence of zinc history ancient use the charaka samhita thought to have been written between and ad mentions a metal which when oxidized produces pushpanjan thought to be zinc oxide zinc mines at zawar near udaipur in india have been active since the mauryan period c and bce the smelting of metallic zinc here however appears to have begun around the th century ad one estimate is that this location produced an estimated million tonnes of metallic zinc and zinc oxide from the th to th centuries another estimate gives a total production of tonnes of metallic zinc over this period the rasaratna samuccaya written in approximately the th century ad mentions two types of zinc containing ores one used for metal extraction and another used for medicinal purposes various isolated examples of the use of impure zinc in ancient times have been discovered zinc ores were used to make the zinc copper alloy brass thousands of years prior to the discovery of zinc as a separate element judean brass from the th to th centuries bc contains zinc knowledge of how to produce brass spread to ancient greece by the th century bc but few varieties were made ornaments made of alloys containing zinc with lead iron antimony and other metals making up the remainder have been found that are years old a possibly prehistoric statuette containing zinc was found in a dacian archaeological site the oldest known pills were made of the zinc carbonates hydrozincite and smithsonite the pills were used for sore eyes and were found aboard the roman ship relitto del pozzino wrecked in bc the manufacture of brass was known to the romans by about bc they made brass by heating powdered calamine zinc silicate or carbonate charcoal and copper together in a crucible the resulting calamine brass was then either cast or hammered into shape for use in weaponry some coins struck by romans in the christian era are made of what is probably calamine brass strabo writing in the st century bc but quoting a now lost work of the th century bc historian theopompus mentions drops of false silver which when mixed with copper make brass this may refer to small quantities of zinc that is a by product of smelting sulfide ores zinc in such remnants in smelting ovens was usually discarded as it was thought to be worthless the berne zinc tablet is a votive plaque dating to roman gaul made of an alloy that is mostly zinc early studies and naming zinc was distinctly recognized as a metal under the designation of yasada or jasada in the medical lexicon ascribed to the hindu king madanapala of taka dynasty and written about the year smelting and extraction of impure zinc by reducing calamine with wool and other organic substances was accomplished in the th century in india the chinese did not learn of the technique until the th century alchemists burned zinc metal in air and collected the resulting zinc oxide on a condenser some alchemists called this zinc oxide lana philosophica latin for philosopher s wool because it collected in wooly tufts whereas others thought it looked like white snow and named it nix album the name of the metal was probably first documented by paracelsus a swiss born german alchemist who referred to the metal as zincum or zinken in his book liber mineralium ii in the th century the word is probably derived from the german zinke and supposedly meant tooth like pointed or jagged metallic zinc crystals have a needle like appearance zink could also imply tin like because of its relation to german zinn meaning tin yet another possibility is that the word is derived from the persian word seng meaning stone the metal was also called indian tin tutanego calamine and spinter german metallurgist andreas libavius received a quantity of what he called calay of malabar from a cargo ship captured from the portuguese in the year libavius described the properties of the sample which may have been zinc zinc was regularly imported to europe from the orient in the th and early th centuries but was at times very expensive isolation metallic zinc was isolated in india by ad much earlier than in the west before it was isolated in europe it was imported from india in about ce postlewayt s universal dictionary a contemporary source giving technological information in europe did not mention zinc before but the element was studied before then flemish metallurgist and alchemist p m de respour reported that he had extracted metallic zinc from zinc oxide in by the start of the th century tienne fran ois geoffroy described how zinc oxide condenses as yellow crystals on bars of iron placed above zinc ore that is being smelted in britain john lane is said to have carried out experiments to smelt zinc probably at landore prior to his bankruptcy in in in great britain william champion patented a process to extract zinc from calamine in a vertical retort style smelter his technique resembled that used at zawar zinc mines in rajasthan but no evidence suggests he visited the orient champion s process was used through german chemist andreas marggraf normally gets credit for discovering pure metallic zinc even though swedish chemist anton von swab had distilled zinc from calamine four years previously in his experiment marggraf heated a mixture of calamine and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a metal this procedure became commercially practical by later work william champion s brother john patented a process in for calcining zinc sulfide into an oxide usable in the retort process prior to this only calamine could be used to produce zinc in johann christian ruberg improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retort smelter jean jacques daniel dony built a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in belgium that processed even more zinc italian doctor luigi galvani discovered in that connecting the spinal cord of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog s leg to twitch he incorrectly thought he had discovered an ability of nerves and muscles to create electricity and called the effect animal electricity the galvanic cell and the process of galvanization were both named for luigi galvani and his discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries galvanization and cathodic protection galvani s friend alessandro volta continued researching the effect and invented the voltaic pile in volta s pile consisted of a stack of simplified galvanic cells each being one plate of copper and one of zinc connected by an electrolyte by stacking these units in series the voltaic pile or battery as a whole had a higher voltage which could be used more easily than single cells electricity is produced because the volta potential between the two metal plates makes electrons flow from the zinc to the copper and corrode the zinc the non magnetic character of zinc and its lack of color in solution delayed discovery of its importance to biochemistry and nutrition this changed in when carbonic anhydrase an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood was shown to have zinc in its active site the digestive enzyme carboxypeptidase became the second known zinc containing enzyme in production mining and processing zinc is the fourth most common metal in use trailing only iron aluminium and copper with an annual production of about million tonnes the world s largest zinc producer is nyrstar a merger of the australian oz minerals and the belgian umicore about of the world s zinc originates from mining while the remaining comes from recycling secondary zinc commercially pure zinc is known as special high grade often abbreviated shg and is pure worldwide of new zinc is mined from sulfidic ore deposits in which sphalerite zns is nearly always mixed with the sulfides of copper lead and iron zinc mines are scattered throughout the world with the main areas being china australia and peru china produced of the global zinc output in zinc metal is produced using extractive metallurgy the ore is finely ground then put through froth flotation to separate minerals from gangue on the property of hydrophobicity to get a zinc sulfide ore concentrate consisting of about zinc sulfur iron and sio roasting converts the zinc sulfide concentrate to zinc oxide zns o t o zno so displaystyle ce zns o t o zno so the sulfur dioxide is used for the production of sulfuric acid which is necessary for the leaching process if deposits of zinc carbonate zinc silicate or zinc spinel like the skorpion deposit in namibia are used for zinc production the roasting can be omitted for further processing two basic methods are used pyrometallurgy or electrowinning pyrometallurgy reduces zinc oxide with carbon or carbon monoxide at c f into the metal which is distilled as zinc vapor to separate it from other metals which are not volatile at those temperatures the zinc vapor is collected in a condenser the equations below describe this process zno c o c zn co displaystyle ce zno c oc zn co zno co o c zn co displaystyle ce zno co oc zn co in electrowinning zinc is leached

displaystyle ce znso h o zn o h so the sulfuric acid is regenerated and recycled to the leaching step when galvanised feedstock is fed to an electric arc furnace the zinc is recovered from the dust by a number of processes predominantly the waelz process as of environmental impact refinement of sulfidic zinc ores produces large volumes of sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor smelter slag and other residues contain significant quantities of metals about million tonnes of metallic zinc and thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the belgian towns of la calamine and plombi res between and the dumps of the past mining operations leach zinc and cadmium and the sediments of the geul river contain non trivial amounts of metals about two thousand years ago emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled thousand tonnes a year after increasing fold from zinc emissions peaked at million tonnes per year in the s and declined to million tonnes in the s although a study of the arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline man made and natural emissions occur at a ratio of to zinc in rivers flowing through industrial and mining areas can be as high as ppm effective sewage treatment greatly reduces this treatment along the rhine for example has decreased zinc levels to ppb concentrations of zinc as low as ppm adversely affects the amount of oxygen that fish can carry in their blood soils contaminated with zinc from mining refining or fertilizing with zinc bearing sludge can contain several grams of zinc per kilogram of dry soil levels of zinc in excess of ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals such as iron and manganese zinc levels of ppm to ppm have been recorded in some soil samples applications major applications of zinc include numbers are given for the us galvanizing brass and bronze other alloys miscellaneous anti corrosion and batteries zinc is most commonly used as an anti corrosion agent and galvanization coating of iron or steel is the most familiar form in in the united states or tons of the zinc metal was used for galvanization zinc is more reactive than iron or steel and thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away a protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate zn oh co forms as the zinc corrodes this protection lasts even after the zinc layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away the zinc is applied electrochemically or as molten zinc by hot dip galvanizing or spraying galvanization is used on chain link fencing guard rails suspension bridges lightposts metal roofs heat exchangers and car bodies the relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection cp for example cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe zinc acts as the anode negative terminus by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water a zinc disc attached to a ship s iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact similarly a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection with a standard electrode potential sep of volts zinc is used as an anode material for batteries more reactive lithium sep v is used for anodes in lithium batteries powdered zinc is used in this way in alkaline batteries and the case which also serves as the anode of zinc carbon batteries is formed from sheet zinc zinc is used as the anode or fuel of the zinc air battery fuel cell the zinc cerium redox flow battery also relies on a zinc based negative half cell alloys a widely used zinc alloy is brass in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from to zinc depending upon the type of brass brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper and has superior corrosion resistance these properties make it useful in communication equipment hardware musical instruments and water valves other widely used zinc alloys include nickel silver typewriter metal soft and aluminium solder and commercial bronze zinc is also used in contemporary pipe organs as a substitute for the traditional lead tin alloy in pipes alloys of zinc copper and aluminium find limited use in certain types of machine bearings zinc has been the primary metal in american one cent coins pennies since the zinc core is coated with a thin layer of copper to give the appearance of a copper coin in tonnes short tons of zinc were used to produce billion pennies in the united states alloys of zinc with small amounts of copper aluminium and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting especially in the automotive electrical and hardware industries these alloys are marketed under the name zamak an example of this is zinc aluminium the low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes the low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly another alloy marketed under the brand name prestal contains zinc and aluminium and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic this superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement similar alloys with the addition of a small amount of lead can be cold rolled into sheets an alloy of zinc and aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too expensive for building facades roofing and other applications for sheet metal formed by deep drawing roll forming or bending zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these manufacturing processes as a dense inexpensive easily worked material zinc is used as a lead replacement in the wake of lead concerns zinc appears in weights for various applications ranging from fishing to tire balances and flywheels cadmium zinc telluride czt is a semiconductive alloy that can be divided into an array of small sensing devices these devices are similar to an integrated circuit and can detect the energy of incoming gamma ray photons when behind an absorbing mask the czt sensor array can determine the direction of the rays other industrial uses roughly one quarter of all zinc output in the united states in was consumed in zinc compounds a variety of which are used industrially zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints and as a catalyst in the manufacture of rubber to disperse heat zinc oxide is used to protect rubber polymers and plastics from ultraviolet radiation uv the semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products the zinc zinc oxide cycle is a two step thermochemical process based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production zinc chloride is often added to lumber as a fire retardant and sometimes as a wood preservative it is used in the manufacture of other chemicals zinc methyl zn ch is used in a number of organic syntheses zinc sulfide zns is used in luminescent pigments such as on the hands of clocks x ray and television screens and luminous paints crystals of zns are used in lasers that operate in the mid infrared part of the spectrum zinc sulfate is a chemical in dyes and pigments zinc pyrithione is used in antifouling paints zinc powder is sometimes used as a propellant in model rockets when a compressed mixture of zinc and sulfur powder is ignited there is a violent chemical reaction this produces zinc sulfide together with large amounts of hot gas heat and light zinc sheet metal is used as a durable covering for roofs walls and countertops the last often seen in bistros and oyster bars and is known for the rustic look imparted by its surface oxidation in use to a blue gray patina and susceptibility to scratching zn the most abundant isotope of zinc is very susceptible to neutron activation being transmuted into the highly radioactive zn which has a half life of days and produces intense gamma radiation because of this zinc oxide used in nuclear reactors as an anti corrosion agent is depleted of zn before use this is called depleted zinc oxide for the same reason zinc has been proposed as a salting material for nuclear weapons cobalt is another better known salting material a jacket of isotopically enriched zn would be irradiated by the intense high energy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon forming a large amount of zn significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapon s fallout such a weapon is not known to have ever been built tested or used zn is used as a tracer to study how alloys that contain zinc wear out or the path and the role of zinc in organisms zinc dithiocarbamate complexes are used as agricultural fungicides these include zineb metiram propineb and ziram zinc naphthenate is used as wood preservative zinc in the form of zddp is used as an anti wear additive for metal parts in engine oil organic chemistry organozinc chemistry is the science of compounds that contain carbon zinc bonds describing the physical properties synthesis and chemical reactions many organozinc compounds are important among important applications are the frankland duppa reaction in which an oxalate ester rococoor reacts with an alkyl halide r x zinc and hydrochloric acid to form the hydroxycarboxylic esters rr cohcoor on the downside organozincs are much less nucleophilic than grignards and they are expensive and difficult to handle commercially available diorganozinc compounds are dimethylzinc diethylzinc and diphenylzinc in one study the active organozinc compound is obtained from much cheaper organobromine precursors zinc has found many uses as a catalyst in organic synthesis including asymmetric synthesis being cheap and easily available alternative to precious metal complexes the results yield and enantiomeric excess obtained with chiral zinc catalysts are comparable to those achieved with palladium ruthenium iridium and others and zinc becomes a metal catalyst of choice dietary supplement in most single tablet over the counter daily vitamin and mineral supplements zinc is included in such forms as zinc oxide zinc acetate zinc gluconate or zinc amino acid chelate generally zinc supplement is recommended where there is high risk of zinc deficiency such as low and middle income countries as a preventive measure although zinc sulfate is a commonly used zinc form zinc citrate gluconate and picolinate may be valid options as well these forms are better absorbed than zinc oxide gastroenteritis zinc is an inexpensive and effective part of treatment of diarrhea among children in the developing world zinc becomes depleted in the body during diarrhea and replenishing zinc with a to day course of treatment can reduce the duration and severity of diarrheal episodes and may also prevent future episodes for as long as three months gastroenteritis is strongly attenuated by ingestion of zinc possibly by direct antimicrobial action of the ions in the gastrointestinal tract or by the absorption of the zinc and re release from immune cells all granulocytes secrete zinc or both common cold weight gain zinc deficiency may lead to loss of appetite the use of zinc in the treatment of anorexia has been advocated since at least clinical trials have shown that zinc improved weight gain in anorexia a trial showed that zinc doubled the rate of body mass increase in the treatment of anorexia nervosa deficiency of other nutrients such as tyrosine tryptophan and thiamine could contribute to this phenomenon of malnutrition induced malnutrition a meta analysis of prospective intervention trials regarding zinc supplementation and its effects on the growth of children in many countries showed that zinc supplementation alone had a statistically significant effect on linear growth and body weight gain indicating that other deficiencies that may have been present were not responsible for growth retardation other a cochrane review stated that people taking zinc supplement may be less likely to progress to age related macular degeneration zinc supplement is an effective treatment for acrodermatitis enteropathica a genetic disorder affecting zinc absorption that was previously fatal to affected infants zinc deficiency has been associated with major depressive disorder mdd and zinc supplements may be an effective treatment zinc may help individuals sleep more topical use topical preparations of zinc include those used on the skin often in the form of zinc oxide zinc oxide is generally recognised by the fda as safe and effective and is considered a very photo stable zinc oxide is one of the most common active ingredients formulated into a sunscreen to mitigate sunburn applied thinly to a baby s diaper area perineum with each diaper change it can protect against diaper rash chelated zinc is used in toothpastes and mouthwashes to prevent bad breath zinc citrate helps reduce the build up of calculus tartar zinc pyrithione is widely included in shampoos to prevent dandruff topical zinc has also been shown to effectively treat as well as prolong remission in genital herpes biological role zinc is an essential trace element for humans and other animals for plants and for microorganisms zinc is required for the function of over enzymes and transcription factors and is stored and transferred in metallothioneins it is the second most abundant trace metal in humans after iron and it is the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes in proteins zinc ions are often coordinated to the amino acid side chains of aspartic acid glutamic acid cysteine and histidine the theoretical and computational description of this zinc binding in proteins as well as that of other transition metals is difficult roughly grams of zinc are distributed throughout the human body most zinc is in the brain muscle bones kidney and liver with the highest concentrations in the prostate and parts of the eye semen is particularly rich in zinc a key factor in prostate gland function and reproductive organ growth zinc homeostasis of the body is mainly controlled by the intestine here zip and especially trpm were linked to intestinal zinc uptake essential for postnatal survival in humans the biological roles of zinc are ubiquitous it interacts with a wide range of organic ligands and has roles in the metabolism of rna and dna signal transduction and gene expression it also regulates apoptosis a review from indicated that about of human proteins bind zinc in addition to hundreds more that transport and traffic zinc a similar in silico study in the plant arabidopsis thaliana found zinc related proteins in the brain zinc is stored in specific synaptic vesicles by glutamatergic neurons and can modulate neuronal excitability it plays a key role in synaptic plasticity and so in learning zinc homeostasis also plays a critical role in the functional regulation of the central nervous system dysregulation of zinc homeostasis in the central nervous system that results in excessive synaptic zinc concentrations is believed to induce neurotoxicity through mitochondrial oxidative stress e g by disrupting certain enzymes involved in the electron transport chain including complex i complex iii and ketoglutarate dehydrogenase the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis glutamatergic neuronal excitotoxicity and interference with intraneuronal signal transduction l and d histidine facilitate brain zinc uptake slc a is the primary zinc transporter involved in cerebral zinc homeostasis enzymes zinc is an efficient lewis acid making it a useful catalytic agent in hydroxylation and other enzymatic reactions the metal also has a flexible coordination geometry which allows proteins using it to rapidly shift conformations to perform biological reactions two examples of zinc containing enzymes are carbonic anhydrase and carboxypeptidase which are vital to the processes of carbon dioxide co regulation and digestion of proteins respectively in vertebrate blood carbonic anhydrase converts co into bicarbonate and the same enzyme transforms the bicarbonate back into co for exhalation through the lungs without this enzyme this conversion would occur about one million times slower at the normal blood ph of or would require a ph of or more the non related carbonic anhydrase is required in plants for leaf formation the synthesis of indole acetic acid auxin and alcoholic fermentation carboxypeptidase cleaves peptide linkages during digestion of proteins a coordinate covalent bond is formed between the terminal peptide and a c o group attached to zinc which gives the carbon a positive charge this helps to create a hydrophobic pocket on the enzyme near the zinc which attracts the non polar part of the protein being digested signalling zinc has been recognized as a messenger able to activate signalling pathways many of these pathways provide the driving force in aberrant cancer growth they can be targeted through zip transporters other proteins zinc serves a purely structural role in zinc fingers twists and clusters zinc fingers form parts of some transcription factors which are proteins that recognize dna base sequences during the replication and transcription of dna each of the nine or ten zn ions in a zinc finger helps maintain the finger s structure by coordinately binding to four amino acids in the transcription factor in blood plasma zinc is bound to and transported by albumin low affinity and transferrin because transferrin also transports iron excessive iron reduces zinc absorption and vice versa a similar antagonism exists with copper the concentration of zinc in blood plasma stays relatively constant regardless of zinc intake cells in the salivary gland prostate immune system and intestine use zinc signaling to communicate with other cells zinc may be held in metallothionein reserves within microorganisms or in the intestines or liver of animals metallothionein in intestinal cells is capable of adjusting absorption of zinc by however inadequate or excessive zinc intake can be harmful excess zinc particularly impairs copper absorption because metallothionein absorbs both metals the human dopamine transporter contains a high affinity extracellular zinc binding site which upon zinc binding inhibits dopamine reuptake and amplifies amphetamine induced dopamine efflux in vitro the human serotonin transporter and norepinephrine transporter do not contain zinc binding sites some ef hand calcium binding proteins such as s or ncs are also able to bind zinc ions nutrition dietary recommendations the u s institute of medicine iom updated estimated average requirements ears and recommended dietary allowances rdas for zinc in the current ears for zinc for women and men ages and up is and mg day respectively the rdas are and mg day rdas are higher than ears so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements rda for pregnancy is mg day rda for lactation is mg day for infants up to months the rda is mg day for children ages years the rda increases with age from to mg day as for safety the iom sets tolerable upper intake levels uls for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient in the case of zinc the adult ul is mg day lower for children collectively the ears rdas ais and uls are referred to as dietary reference intakes dris the european food safety authority efsa refers to the collective set of information as dietary reference values with population reference intake pri instead of rda and average requirement instead of ear ai and ul are defined the same as in the united states for people ages and older the pri calculations are complex as the efsa has set higher and higher values as the phytate content of the diet increases for women pris increase from to mg day as phytate intake increases from to mg day for men the range is to mg day these pris are higher than the u s rdas the efsa reviewed the same safety question and set its ul at mg day which is much lower than the u s value for u s food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of daily value dv for zinc labeling purposes of the daily value was mg but on may it was revised to mg a table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at reference daily intake dietary intake animal products such as meat fish shellfish fowl eggs and dairy contain zinc the concentration of zinc in plants varies with the level in the soil with adequate zinc in the soil the food plants that contain the most zinc are wheat germ and bran and various seeds including sesame poppy alfalfa celery and mustard zinc is also found in beans nuts almonds whole grains pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds and blackcurrant other sources include fortified food and dietary supplements in various forms a review concluded that zinc oxide one of the most common supplements in the united states and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body this review cited studies that found lower plasma zinc concentrations in the subjects who consumed zinc oxide and zinc carbonate than in those who took zinc acetate and sulfate salts for fortification however a review recommended cereals containing zinc oxide as a cheap stable source that is as easily absorbed as the more expensive forms a study found that various compounds of zinc including oxide and sulfate did not show statistically significant differences in absorption when added as fortificants to maize tortillas deficiency nearly two billion people in the developing world are deficient in zinc groups at risk include children in developing countries and elderly with chronic illnesses in children it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea and contributes to the death of about children worldwide per year the world health organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality especially among children with low birth weight or stunted growth however zinc supplements should not be administered alone because many in the developing world have several deficiencies and zinc interacts with other micronutrients while zinc deficiency is usually due to insufficient dietary intake it can be associated with malabsorption acrodermatitis enteropathica chronic liver disease chronic renal disease sickle cell disease diabetes malignancy and other chronic illnesses in the united states a federal survey of food consumption determined that for women and men over the age of average consumption was and mg day respectively for women consumed less than the ear for men the percentages below ear increased with age the most recent published update of the survey nhanes reported lower averages and mg day again with intake decreasing with age symptoms of mild zinc deficiency are diverse clinical outcomes include depressed growth diarrhea impotence and delayed sexual maturation alopecia eye and skin lesions impaired appetite altered cognition impaired immune functions defects in carbohydrate utilization and reproductive teratogenesis zinc deficiency depresses immunity but excessive zinc does also despite some concerns western vegetarians and vegans do not suffer any more from overt zinc deficiency than meat eaters major plant sources of zinc include cooked dried beans sea vegetables fortified cereals soy foods nuts peas and seeds however phytates in many whole grains and fibers may interfere with zinc absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood effects the zinc chelator phytate found in seeds and cereal bran can contribute to zinc malabsorption some evidence suggests that more than the us rda mg day for adult women mg day for adult men may be needed in those whose diet is high in phytates such as some vegetarians the european food safety authority efsa guidelines attempt to compensate for this by recommending higher zinc intake when dietary phytate intake is greater these considerations must be balanced against the paucity of adequate zinc biomarkers and the most widely used indicator plasma zinc has poor sensitivity and specificity soil remediation species of calluna erica and vaccinium can grow in zinc metalliferous soils because translocation of toxic ions is prevented by the action of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi agriculture zinc deficiency appears to be the most common micronutrient deficiency in crop plants it is particularly common in high ph soils zinc deficient soil is cultivated in the cropland of about half of turkey and india a third of china and most of western australia substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas plants that grow in soils that are zinc deficient are more susceptible to disease zinc is added to the soil primarily through the weathering of rocks but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion mine waste phosphate fertilizers pesticide zinc phosphide limestone manure sewage sludge and particles from galvanized surfaces excess zinc is toxic to plants although zinc toxicity is far less widespread precautions toxicity although zinc is an essential requirement for good health excess zinc can be harmful excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption the free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants invertebrates and even vertebrate fish the free ion activity model is well established in the literature and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms a recent example showed micromolar killing of all daphnia in water the free zinc ion is a powerful lewis acid up to the point of being corrosive stomach acid contains hydrochloric acid in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride swallowing a post american one cent piece zinc can cause damage to the stomach lining through the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach evidence shows that people taking mg of zinc daily may suffer induced copper deficiency a trial observed that elderly men taking mg daily were hospitalized for urinary complications more often than those taking a placebo levels of mg may interfere with the utilization of copper and iron or adversely affect cholesterol zinc in excess of ppm in soil interferes with the plant absorption of other essential metals such as iron and manganese a condition called the zinc shakes or zinc chills can be induced by inhalation of zinc fumes while brazing or welding galvanized materials zinc is a common ingredient of denture cream which may contain between and mg of zinc per gram disability and even deaths from excessive use of these products have been claimed the u s food and drug administration fda states that zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose causing anosmia reports of anosmia were also observed in the s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent polio infections on june the fda ordered removal of zinc based intranasal cold products from store shelves the fda said the loss of smell can be life threatening because people with impaired smell cannot detect leaking gas or smoke and cannot tell if food has spoiled before they eat it recent research suggests that the topical antimicrobial zinc pyrithione is a potent heat shock response inducer that may impair genomic integrity with induction of parp dependent energy crisis in cultured human keratinocytes and melanocytes poisoning in the us mint began minting pennies coated in copper but containing primarily zinc zinc pennies pose a risk of zinc toxicosis which can be fatal one reported case of chronic ingestion of pennies over kg of zinc resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis another patient who ingested grams of zinc showed only lethargy and ataxia gross lack of coordination of muscle movements several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins pennies and other small coins are sometimes ingested by dogs requiring veterinary removal of the foreign objects the zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity commonly fatal in dogs through severe hemolytic anemia and liver or kidney damage vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms zinc is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning can often be fatal the consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc ,30
Gallium,Ga,gallium is a chemical element with the symbol ga and atomic number discovered by french chemist paul mile lecoq de boisbaudran in gallium is in group of the periodic table and is similar to the other metals of the group aluminium indium and thallium gallium exhibits relatively less similarity with boron due to latter being small in atomic size and lacking its reach to d orbital elemental gallium is a soft silvery metal in standard temperature and pressure in its liquid state it becomes silvery white if too much force is applied the gallium may fracture conchoidally since its discovery in gallium has widely been used to make alloys with low melting points it is also used in semiconductors as a dopant in semiconductor substrates the melting point of gallium is used as a temperature reference point gallium alloys are used in thermometers as a non toxic and environmentally friendly alternative to mercury and can withstand higher temperatures than mercury an even lower melting point of c f well below the freezing point of water is claimed for the alloy galinstan gallium indium and tin by weight but that may be the freezing point with the effect of supercooling gallium does not occur as a free element in nature but as gallium iii compounds in trace amounts in zinc ores such as sphalerite and in bauxite elemental gallium is a liquid at temperatures greater than c f and will melt in a person s hands at normal human body temperature of c f gallium is predominantly used in electronics gallium arsenide the primary chemical compound of gallium in electronics is used in microwave circuits high speed switching circuits and infrared circuits semiconducting gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride produce blue and violet light emitting diodes and diode lasers gallium is also used in the production of artificial gadolinium gallium garnet for jewelry gallium is considered a technology critical element by the united states national library of medicine and frontiers media gallium has no known natural role in biology gallium iii behaves in a similar manner to ferric salts in biological systems and has been used in some medical applications including pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals physical properties elemental gallium is not found in nature but it is easily obtained by smelting very pure gallium is a silvery blue metal that fractures conchoidally like glass gallium liquid expands by when it solidifies therefore it should not be stored in glass or metal containers because the container may rupture when the gallium changes state gallium shares the higher density liquid state with a short list of other materials that includes water silicon germanium bismuth and plutonium gallium forms alloys with most metals it readily diffuses into cracks or grain boundaries of some metals such as aluminium aluminium zinc alloys and steel causing extreme loss of strength and ductility called liquid metal embrittlement the melting point of gallium at k c f is just above room temperature and is approximately the same as the average summer daytime temperatures in earth s mid latitudes this melting point mp is one of the formal temperature reference points in the international temperature scale of its established by the international bureau of weights and measures bipm the triple point of gallium k c f is used by the us national institute of standards and technology nist in preference to the melting point the melting point of gallium allows it to melt in the human hand and then solidify if removed the liquid metal has a strong tendency to supercool below its melting point freezing point ga nanoparticles can be kept in the liquid state below k seeding with a crystal helps to initiate freezing gallium is one of the four non radioactive metals with caesium rubidium and mercury that are known to be liquid at or near normal room temperature of the four gallium is the only one that is neither highly reactive as are rubidium and caesium nor highly toxic as is mercury and can therefore be used in metal in glass high temperature thermometers it is also notable for having one of the largest liquid ranges for a metal and for having unlike mercury a low vapor pressure at high temperatures gallium s boiling point k is nearly nine times higher than its melting point on the absolute scale the greatest ratio between melting point and boiling point of any element unlike mercury liquid gallium metal wets glass and skin along with most other materials with the exceptions of quartz graphite gallium iii oxide and ptfe making it mechanically more difficult to handle even though it is substantially less toxic and requires far fewer precautions than mercury gallium painted onto glass is a brilliant mirror for this reason as well as the metal contamination and freezing expansion problems samples of gallium metal are usually supplied in polyethylene packets within other containers gallium does not crystallize in any of the simple crystal structures the stable phase under normal conditions is orthorhombic with atoms in the conventional unit cell within a unit cell each atom has only one nearest neighbor at a distance of pm the remaining six unit cell neighbors are spaced and pm farther away and they are grouped in pairs with the same distance many stable and metastable phases are found as function of temperature and pressure the bonding between the two nearest neighbors is covalent hence ga dimers are seen as the fundamental building blocks of the crystal this explains the low melting point relative to the neighbor elements aluminium and indium this structure is strikingly similar to that of iodine and may form because of interactions between the single p electrons of gallium atoms further away from the nucleus than the s electrons and the ar d core this phenomenon recurs with mercury with its pseudo noble gas xe f d s electron configuration which is liquid at room temperature the d electrons do not shield the outer electrons very well from the nucleus and hence the first ionisation energy of gallium is greater than that of aluminium ga dimers do not persist in the liquid state and liquid gallium exhibits a complex low coordinated structure in which each gallium atom is surrounded by others rather than neighbors typical of most liquid metals the physical properties of gallium are highly anisotropic i e have different values along the three major crystallographic axes a b and c see table producing a significant difference between the linear and volume thermal expansion coefficients the properties of gallium are strongly temperature dependent particularly near the melting point for example the coefficient of thermal expansion increases by several hundred percent upon melting isotopes gallium has known isotopes ranging in mass number from to only two isotopes are stable and occur naturally gallium and gallium gallium is more abundant it makes up about of natural gallium while gallium makes up the remaining all the other isotopes are radioactive with gallium being the longest lived half life days isotopes lighter than gallium usually decay through beta plus decay positron emission or electron capture to isotopes of zinc although the lightest few mass numbers decay through prompt proton emission isotopes heavier than gallium decay through beta minus decay electron emission possibly with delayed neutron emission to isotopes of germanium while gallium can decay through both beta minus decay and electron capture gallium is unique among the light isotopes in having only electron capture as a decay mode as its decay energy is not sufficient to allow positron emission gallium and gallium half life min are both used in nuclear medicine chemical properties gallium is found primarily in the oxidation state the oxidation state is also found in some compounds although it is less common than it is for gallium s heavier congeners indium and thallium for example the very stable gacl contains both gallium i and gallium iii and can be formulated as gaigaiiicl in contrast the monochloride is unstable above c disproportionating into elemental gallium and gallium iii chloride compounds containing ga ga bonds are true gallium ii compounds such as gas which can be formulated as ga s and the dioxan complex ga cl c h o aqueous chemistry strong acids dissolve gallium forming gallium iii salts such as ga no gallium nitrate aqueous solutions of gallium iii salts contain the hydrated gallium ion ga h o gallium iii hydroxide ga oh may be precipitated from gallium iii solutions by adding ammonia dehydrating ga oh at c produces gallium oxide hydroxide gao oh alkaline hydroxide solutions dissolve gallium forming gallate salts not to be confused with identically named gallic acid salts containing the ga oh anion gallium hydroxide which is amphoteric also dissolves in alkali to form gallate salts although earlier work suggested ga oh as another possible gallate anion it was not found in later work oxides and chalcogenides gallium reacts with the chalcogens only at relatively high temperatures at room temperature gallium metal is not reactive with air and water because it forms a passive protective oxide layer at higher temperatures however it reacts with atmospheric oxygen to form gallium iii oxide ga o reducing ga o with elemental gallium in vacuum at c to c yields the dark brown gallium i oxide ga o ga o is a very strong reducing agent capable of reducing h so to h s it disproportionates at c back to gallium and ga o gallium iii sulfide ga s has possible crystal modifications it can be made by the reaction of gallium with hydrogen sulfide h s at c alternatively ga oh can be used at c ga oh h s ga s h oreacting a mixture of alkali metal carbonates and ga o with h s leads to the formation of thiogallates containing the ga s anion strong acids decompose these salts releasing h s in the process the mercury salt hgga s can be used as a phosphor gallium also forms sulfides in lower oxidation states such as gallium ii sulfide and the green gallium i sulfide the latter of which is produced from the former by heating to c under a stream of nitrogen the other binary chalcogenides ga se and ga te have the zincblende structure they are all semiconductors but are easily hydrolysed and have limited utility nitrides and pnictides gallium reacts with ammonia at c to form gallium nitride gan gallium also forms binary compounds with phosphorus arsenic and antimony gallium phosphide gap gallium arsenide gaas and gallium antimonide gasb these compounds have the same structure as zns and have important semiconducting properties gap gaas and gasb can be synthesized by the direct reaction of gallium with elemental phosphorus arsenic or antimony they exhibit higher electrical conductivity than gan gap can also be synthesized by reacting ga o with phosphorus at low temperatures gallium forms ternary nitrides for example li ga n li gan similar compounds with phosphorus and arsenic are possible li gap and li gaas these compounds are easily hydrolyzed by dilute acids and water halides gallium iii oxide reacts with fluorinating agents such as hf or f to form gallium iii fluoride gaf it is an ionic compound strongly insoluble in water however it dissolves in hydrofluoric acid in which it forms an adduct with water gaf h o attempting to dehydrate this adduct forms gaf oh nh o the adduct reacts with ammonia to form gaf nh which can then be heated to form anhydrous gaf gallium trichloride is formed by the reaction of gallium metal with chlorine gas unlike the trifluoride gallium iii chloride exists as dimeric molecules ga cl with a melting point of c eqivalent compounds are formed with bromine and iodine ga br and ga i like the other group trihalides gallium iii halides are lewis acids reacting as halide acceptors with alkali metal halides to form salts containing gax anions where x is a halogen they also react with alkyl halides to form carbocations and gax when heated to a high temperature gallium iii halides react with elemental gallium to form the respective gallium i halides for example gacl reacts with ga to form gacl ga gacl gacl g at lower temperatures the equilibrium shifts toward the left and gacl disproportionates back to elemental gallium and gacl gacl can also be produced by reacting ga with hcl at c the product can be condensed as a red solid gallium i compounds can be stabilized by forming adducts with lewis acids for example gacl alcl ga alcl the so called gallium ii halides gax are actually adducts of gallium i halides with the respective gallium iii halides having the structure ga gax for example gacl gacl ga gacl hydrides like aluminium gallium also forms a hydride gah known as gallane which may be produced by reacting lithium gallanate ligah with gallium iii chloride at c ligah gacl licl gah in the presence of dimethyl ether as solvent gah polymerizes to gah n if no solvent is used the dimer ga h digallane is formed as a gas its structure is similar to diborane having two hydrogen atoms bridging the two gallium centers unlike alh in which aluminium has a coordination number of gallane is unstable above c decomposing to elemental gallium and hydrogen organogallium compounds organogallium compounds are of similar reactivity to organoindium compounds less reactive than organoaluminium compounds but more reactive than organothallium compounds alkylgalliums are monomeric lewis acidity decreases in the order al ga in and as a result organogallium compounds do not form bridged dimers as organoaluminium compounds do organogallium compounds are also less reactive than organoaluminium compounds they do form stable peroxides these alkylgalliums are liquids at room temperature having low melting points and are quite mobile and flammable triphenylgallium is monomeric in solution but its crystals form chain structures due to weak intermolecluar ga c interactions gallium trichloride is a common starting reagent for the formation of organogallium compounds such as in carbogallation reactions gallium trichloride reacts with lithium cyclopentadienide in diethyl ether to form the trigonal planar gallium cyclopentadienyl complex gacp gallium i forms complexes with arene ligands such as hexamethylbenzene because this ligand is quite bulky the structure of the ga c me is that of a half sandwich less bulky ligands such as mesitylene allow two ligands to be attached to the central gallium atom in a bent sandwich structure benzene is even less bulky and allows the formation of dimers an example is ga c h gacl c h history in the existence of gallium was first predicted by russian chemist dmitri mendeleev who named it eka aluminium from its position in his periodic table he also predicted several properties of eka aluminium that correspond closely to the real properties of gallium such as its density melting point oxide character and bonding in chloride mendeleev further predicted that eka aluminium would be discovered by means of the spectroscope and that metallic eka aluminium would dissolve slowly in both acids and alkalis and would not react with air he also predicted that m o would dissolve in acids to give mx salts that eka aluminium salts would form basic salts that eka aluminium sulfate should form alums and that anhydrous mcl should have a greater volatility than zncl all of these predictions turned out to be true gallium was discovered using spectroscopy by french chemist paul emile lecoq de boisbaudran in from its characteristic spectrum two violet lines in a sample of sphalerite later that year lecoq obtained the free metal by electrolysis of the hydroxide in potassium hydroxide solution he named the element gallia from latin gallia meaning gaul after his native land of france it was later claimed that in a multilingual pun of a kind favoured by men of science in the th century he had also named gallium after himself le coq is french for the rooster and the latin word for rooster is gallus in an article lecoq denied this conjecture originally de boisbaudran determined the density of gallium as g cm the only property that failed to match mendeleev s predictions mendeleev then wrote to him and suggested that he should remeasure the density and de boisbaudran then obtained the correct value of g cm that mendeleev had predicted exactly from its discovery in until the era of semiconductors the primary uses of gallium were high temperature thermometrics and metal alloys with unusual properties of stability or ease of melting some such being liquid at room temperature the development of gallium arsenide as a direct bandgap semiconductor in the s ushered in the most important stage in the applications of gallium in the electronics industry used gallium to fabricate light emitting diodes photovoltaics and semiconductors while the metals business used it to reduce the melting point of alloys occurrence gallium does not exist as a free element in the earth s crust and the few high content minerals such as gallite cugas are too rare to serve as a primary source the abundance in the earth s crust is approximately ppm this is comparable to the crustal abundances of lead cobalt and niobium yet unlike these elements gallium does not form its own ore deposits with concentrations of wt in ore rather it occurs at trace concentrations similar to the crustal value in zinc ores and at somewhat higher values ppm in aluminium ores from both of which it is extracted as a by product this lack of independent deposits is due to gallium s geochemical behaviour showing no strong enrichment in the processes relevant to the formation of most ore deposits the united states geological survey usgs estimates that more than million tons of gallium is contained in known reserves of bauxite and zinc ores some coal flue dusts contain small quantities of gallium typically less than by weight however these amounts are not extractable without mining of the host materials see below thus the availability of gallium is fundamentally determined by the rate at which bauxite zinc ores and coal are extracted production and availability gallium is produced exclusively as a by product during the processing of the ores of other metals its main source material is bauxite the chief ore of aluminium but minor amounts are also extracted from sulfidic zinc ores sphalerite being the main host mineral in the past certain coals were an important source during the processing of bauxite to alumina in the bayer process gallium accumulates in the sodium hydroxide liquor from this it can be extracted by a variety of methods the most recent is the use of ion exchange resin achievable extraction efficiencies critically depend on the original concentration in the feed bauxite at a typical feed concentration of ppm about of the contained gallium is extractable the remainder reports to the red mud and aluminium hydroxide streams gallium is removed from the ion exchange resin in solution electrolysis then gives gallium metal for semiconductor use it is further purified with zone melting or single crystal extraction from a melt czochralski process purities of are routinely achieved and commercially available its by product status means that gallium production is constrained by the amount of bauxite sulfidic zinc ores and coal extracted per year therefore its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential the supply potential of a by product is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its host materials per year under current market conditions i e technology and price reserves and resources are not relevant for by products since they cannot be extracted independently from the main products recent estimates put the supply potential of gallium at a minimum of t yr from bauxite t yr from sulfidic zinc ores and potentially t yr from coal these figures are significantly greater than current production t in thus major future increases in the by product production of gallium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price the average price for low grade gallium was per kilogram in and per kilogram in in the world s production of low grade gallium was ca tons an increase of from china japan south korea russia and ukraine were the leading producers while germany ceased primary production of gallium in the yield of high purity gallium was ca tons mostly originating from china japan slovakia uk and u s the world annual production capacity was estimated at tons for low grade and tons for refined gallium china produced ca tons of low grade gallium in and ca tons in it also accounted for more than half of global led production applications semiconductor applications dominate the commercial demand for gallium accounting for of the total the next major application is for gadolinium gallium garnets semiconductors extremely high purity gallium is commercially available to serve the semiconductor industry gallium arsenide gaas and gallium nitride gan used in electronic components represented about of the gallium consumption in the united states in about of semiconductor gallium is used in the u s in integrated circuits mostly gallium arsenide such as the manufacture of ultra high speed logic chips and mesfets for low noise microwave preamplifiers in cell phones about of this gallium is used in optoelectronics worldwide gallium arsenide makes up of the annual global gallium consumption it amounted to billion in with originating from cell phones from wireless communications and the rest from automotive consumer fiber optic and military applications the recent increase in gaas consumption is mostly related to the emergence of g and g smartphones which use times more gaas than older models gallium arsenide and gallium nitride can also be found in a variety of optoelectronic devices which had a market share of billion in and billion in aluminium gallium arsenide algaas is used in high power infrared laser diodes the semiconductors gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride are used in blue and violet optoelectronic devices mostly laser diodes and light emitting diodes for example gallium nitride nm diode lasers are used as a violet light source for higher density blu ray disc compact data disc drives other major application of gallium nitride are cable television transmission commercial wireless infrastructure power electronics and satellites the gan radio frequency device market alone was estimated at million in and million in multijunction photovoltaic cells developed for satellite power applications are made by molecular beam epitaxy or metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy of thin films of gallium arsenide indium gallium phosphide or indium gallium arsenide the mars exploration rovers and several satellites use triple junction gallium arsenide on germanium cells gallium is also a component in photovoltaic compounds such as copper indium gallium selenium sulfide cu in ga se s used in solar panels as a cost efficient alternative to crystalline silicon galinstan and other alloys gallium readily alloys with most metals and is used as an ingredient in low melting alloys the nearly eutectic alloy of gallium indium and tin is a room temperature liquid used in medical thermometers this alloy with the trade name galinstan with the stan referring to the tin stannum in latin has a low melting point of c f it has been suggested that this family of alloys could also be used to cool computer chips in place of water and is often used as a replacement for thermal paste in high performance computing gallium alloys have been evaluated as substitutes for mercury dental amalgams but these materials have yet to see wide acceptance liquid alloys containing mostly gallium and indium have been found to precipitate gaseous co into solid carbon and are being researched as potential methodologies for carbon capture and possibly carbon removal because gallium wets glass or porcelain gallium can be used to create brilliant mirrors when the wetting action of gallium alloys is not desired as in galinstan glass thermometers the glass must be protected with a transparent layer of gallium iii oxide the plutonium used in nuclear weapon pits is stabilized in the phase and made machinable by alloying with gallium biomedical applications although gallium has no natural function in biology gallium ions interact with processes in the body in a manner similar to iron iii because these processes include inflammation a marker for many disease states several gallium salts are used or are in development as pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals in medicine interest in the anticancer properties of gallium emerged when it was discovered that ga iii citrate injected in tumor bearing animals localized to sites of tumor clinical trials have shown gallium nitrate to have antineoplastic activity against non hodgkin s lymphoma and urothelial cancers a new generation of gallium ligand complexes such as tris quinolinolato gallium iii kp and gallium maltolate has emerged gallium nitrate brand name ganite has been used as an intravenous pharmaceutical to treat hypercalcemia associated with tumor metastasis to bones gallium is thought to interfere with osteoclast function and the therapy may be effective when other treatments have failed gallium maltolate an oral highly absorbable form of gallium iii ion is an anti proliferative to pathologically proliferating cells particularly cancer cells and some bacteria that accept it in place of ferric iron fe researchers are conducting clinical and preclinical trials on this compound as a potential treatment for a number of cancers infectious diseases and inflammatory diseases when gallium ions are mistakenly taken up in place of iron iii by bacteria such as pseudomonas the ions interfere with respiration and the bacteria die this happens because iron is redox active allowing the transfer of electrons during respiration while gallium is redox inactive a complex amine phenol ga iii compound mr is selectively toxic to parasites resistant to chloroquine a common drug against malaria both the ga iii complex and chloroquine act by inhibiting crystallization of hemozoin a disposal product formed from the digestion of blood by the parasites radiogallium salts gallium salts such as gallium citrate and gallium nitrate are used as radiopharmaceutical agents in the nuclear medicine imaging known as gallium scan the radioactive isotope ga is used and the compound or salt of gallium is unimportant the body handles ga in many ways as though it were fe and the ion is bound and concentrates in areas of inflammation such as infection and in areas of rapid cell division this allows such sites to be imaged by nuclear scan techniques gallium a positron emitter with a half life of min is now used as a diagnostic radionuclide in pet ct when linked to pharmaceutical preparations such as dotatoc a somatostatin analogue used for neuroendocrine tumors investigation and dota tate a newer one used for neuroendocrine metastasis and lung neuroendocrine cancer such as certain types of microcytoma gallium s preparation as a pharmaceutical is chemical and the radionuclide is extracted by elution from germanium a synthetic radioisotope of germanium in gallium generators other uses neutrino detection gallium is used for neutrino detection possibly the largest amount of pure gallium ever collected in a single location is the gallium germanium neutrino telescope used by the sage experiment at the baksan neutrino observatory in russia this detector contains tonnes cubic metres of liquid gallium another experiment was the gallex neutrino detector operated in the early s in an italian mountain tunnel the detector contained tons of watered gallium solar neutrinos caused a few atoms of ga to become radioactive ge which were detected this experiment showed that the solar neutrino flux is less than theory predicted this deficit was not explained until better solar neutrino detectors and theories were constructed see sno ion source gallium is also used as a liquid metal ion source for a focused ion beam for example a focused gallium ion beam was used to create the world s smallest book teeny ted from turnip town lubricants gallium serves as an additive in glide wax for skis and other low friction surface materials flexible electronics materials scientists speculate that the properties of gallium could make it suitable for the development of flexible and wearable devices hydrogen generation gallium disrupts the protective oxide layer on aluminium allowing water to react with the aluminium in alga to produce hydrogen gas humor a well known practical joke among chemists is to fashion gallium spoons and use them to serve tea to unsuspecting guests since gallium has a similar appearance to its lighter homolog aluminium the spoons then melt in the hot tea gallium in the ocean advances in trace element testing have allowed scientists to discover traces of dissolved gallium in the atlantic and pacific oceans in recent years dissolved gallium concentrations have presented in the beaufort sea these reports reflect the possible profiles of the pacific and atlantic ocean waters for the pacific oceans typical dissolved gallium concentrations are between pmol kg at depths m in comparison for atlantic waters pmol kg at depths m gallium has entered our oceans mainly through aeolian input but having gallium in our oceans can be used to resolve aluminium distribution in the oceans the reason for this is that gallium is geochemically similar to aluminium just less reactive gallium also has a slightly larger surface water residence time than aluminium gallium has a similar dissolved profile similar to that of aluminium due to this gallium can be used as a tracer for aluminium gallium can also be used as a tracer of aeolian inputs of iron gallium is used as a tracer for iron in the northwest pacific south and central atlantic oceans for example in the northwest pacific low gallium surface waters in the subpolar region suggest that there is low dust input which can subsequently explain the following high nutrient low chlorophyll environmental behavior precautions metallic gallium is not toxic however exposure to gallium halide complexes can result in acute toxicity the ga ion of soluble gallium salts tends to form the insoluble hydroxide when injected in large doses precipitation of this hydroxide resulted in nephrotoxicity in animals in lower doses soluble gallium is tolerated well and does not accumulate as a poison instead being excreted mostly through urine excretion of gallium occurs in two phases the first phase has a biological half life of hour while the second has a biological half life of hours ,31
Germanium,Ge,germanium is a chemical element with the symbol ge and atomic number it is lustrous hard brittle grayish white and similar in appearance to silicon it is a metalloid in the carbon group that is chemically similar to its group neighbors silicon and tin like silicon germanium naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in nature because it seldom appears in high concentration germanium was discovered comparatively late in the discovery of the elements germanium ranks near fiftieth in relative abundance of the elements in the earth s crust in dmitri mendeleev predicted its existence and some of its properties from its position on his periodic table and called the element ekasilicon in clemens winkler found the new element along with silver and sulfur in the mineral argyrodite winkler named the element after his country germany germanium is mined primarily from sphalerite the primary ore of zinc though germanium is also recovered commercially from silver lead and copper ores elemental germanium is used as a semiconductor in transistors and various other electronic devices historically the first decade of semiconductor electronics was based entirely on germanium presently the major end uses are fibre optic systems infrared optics solar cell applications and light emitting diodes leds germanium compounds are also used for polymerization catalysts and have most recently found use in the production of nanowires this element forms a large number of organogermanium compounds such as tetraethylgermanium useful in organometallic chemistry germanium is considered a technology critical element germanium is not thought to be an essential element for any living organism similar to silicon and aluminium naturally occurring germanium compounds tend to be insoluble in water and thus have little oral toxicity however synthetic soluble germanium salts are nephrotoxic and synthetic chemically reactive germanium compounds with halogens and hydrogen are irritants and toxins history in his report on the periodic law of the chemical elements in the russian chemist dmitri mendeleev predicted the existence of several unknown chemical elements including one that would fill a gap in the carbon family located between silicon and tin because of its position in his periodic table mendeleev called it ekasilicon es and he estimated its atomic weight to be later in mid at a mine near freiberg saxony a new mineral was discovered and named argyrodite because of its high silver content the chemist clemens winkler analyzed this new mineral which proved to be a combination of silver sulfur and a new element winkler was able to isolate the new element in and found it similar to antimony he initially considered the new element to be eka antimony but was soon convinced that it was instead eka silicon before winkler published his results on the new element he decided that he would name his element neptunium since the recent discovery of planet neptune in had similarly been preceded by mathematical predictions of its existence however the name neptunium had already been given to another proposed chemical element though not the element that today bears the name neptunium which was discovered in so instead winkler named the new element germanium from the latin word germania for germany in honor of his homeland argyrodite proved empirically to be ag ges because this new element showed some similarities with the elements arsenic and antimony its proper place in the periodic table was under consideration but its similarities with dmitri mendeleev s predicted element ekasilicon confirmed that place on the periodic table with further material from kg of ore from the mines in saxony winkler confirmed the chemical properties of the new element in he also determined an atomic weight of by analyzing pure germanium tetrachloride gecl while lecoq de boisbaudran deduced by a comparison of the lines in the spark spectrum of the element winkler was able to prepare several new compounds of germanium including fluorides chlorides sulfides dioxide and tetraethylgermane ge c h the first organogermane the physical data from those compounds which corresponded well with mendeleev s predictions made the discovery an important confirmation of mendeleev s idea of element periodicity here is a comparison between the prediction and winkler s data until the late s germanium was thought to be a poorly conducting metal germanium did not become economically significant until after when its properties as an electronic semiconductor were recognized during world war ii small amounts of germanium were used in some special electronic devices mostly diodes the first major use was the point contact schottky diodes for radar pulse detection during the war the first silicon germanium alloys were obtained in before only a few hundred kilograms of germanium were produced in smelters each year but by the end of the s the annual worldwide production had reached metric tons short tons the development of the germanium transistor in opened the door to countless applications of solid state electronics from through the early s this area provided an increasing market for germanium but then high purity silicon began replacing germanium in transistors diodes and rectifiers for example the company that became fairchild semiconductor was founded in with the express purpose of producing silicon transistors silicon has superior electrical properties but it requires much greater purity that could not be commercially achieved in the early years of semiconductor electronics meanwhile the demand for germanium for fiber optic communication networks infrared night vision systems and polymerization catalysts increased dramatically these end uses represented of worldwide germanium consumption in the us government even designated germanium as a strategic and critical material calling for a ton tonne supply in the national defense stockpile in germanium differs from silicon in that the supply is limited by the availability of exploitable sources while the supply of silicon is limited only by production capacity since silicon comes from ordinary sand and quartz while silicon could be bought in for less than per kg the price of germanium was almost per kg characteristics under standard conditions germanium is a brittle silvery white semi metallic element this form constitutes an allotrope known as germanium which has a metallic luster and a diamond cubic crystal structure the same as diamond while in crystal form germanium has a displacement threshold energy of ev displaystyle text ev at pressures above kbar germanium becomes the allotrope germanium with the same structure as tin like silicon gallium bismuth antimony and water germanium is one of the few substances that expands as it solidifies i e freezes from the molten state germanium is a semiconductor having an indirect bandgap as is crystalline silicon zone refining techniques have led to the production of crystalline germanium for semiconductors that has an impurity of only one part in making it one of the purest materials ever obtained the first metallic material discovered in to become a superconductor in the presence of an extremely strong electromagnetic field was an alloy of germanium uranium and rhodium pure germanium is known to spontaneously extrude very long screw dislocations referred to as germanium whiskers the growth of these whiskers is one of the primary reasons for the failure of older diodes and transistors made from germanium as depending on what they eventually touch they may lead to an electrical short chemistry elemental germanium starts to oxidize slowly in air at around c forming geo germanium is insoluble in dilute acids and alkalis but dissolves slowly in hot concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids and reacts violently with molten alkalis to produce germanates geo germanium occurs mostly in the oxidation state although many compounds are known other oxidation states are rare is found in compounds such as ge cl and and are found on the surface of oxides or negative oxidation states in germanides such as in mg ge germanium cluster anions zintl ions such as ge ge ge ge have been prepared by the extraction from alloys containing alkali metals and germanium in liquid ammonia in the presence of ethylenediamine or a cryptand the oxidation states of the element in these ions are not integers similar to the ozonides o two oxides of germanium are known germanium dioxide geo germania and germanium monoxide geo the dioxide geo can be obtained by roasting germanium disulfide ges and is a white powder that is only slightly soluble in water but reacts with alkalis to form germanates the monoxide germanous oxide can be obtained by the high temperature reaction of geo with ge metal the dioxide and the related oxides and germanates exhibits the unusual property of having a high refractive index for visible light but transparency to infrared light bismuth germanate bi ge o bgo is used as a scintillator binary compounds with other chalcogens are also known such as the disulfide ges diselenide gese and the monosulfide ges selenide gese and telluride gete ges forms as a white precipitate when hydrogen sulfide is passed through strongly acid solutions containing ge iv the disulfide is appreciably soluble in water and in solutions of caustic alkalis or alkaline sulfides nevertheless it is not soluble in acidic water which allowed winkler to discover the element by heating the disulfide in a current of hydrogen the monosulfide ges is formed which sublimes in thin plates of a dark color and metallic luster and is soluble in solutions of the caustic alkalis upon melting with alkaline carbonates and sulfur germanium compounds form salts known as thiogermanates four tetrahalides are known under normal conditions gei is a solid gef a gas and the others volatile liquids for example germanium tetrachloride gecl is obtained as a colorless fuming liquid boiling at c by heating the metal with chlorine all the tetrahalides are readily hydrolyzed to hydrated germanium dioxide gecl is used in the production of organogermanium compounds all four dihalides are known and in contrast to the tetrahalides are polymeric solids additionally ge cl and some higher compounds of formula gencl n are known the unusual compound ge cl has been prepared that contains the ge cl unit with a neopentane structure germane geh is a compound similar in structure to methane polygermanes compounds that are similar to alkanes with formula genh n containing up to five germanium atoms are known the germanes are less volatile and less reactive than their corresponding silicon analogues geh reacts with alkali metals in liquid ammonia to form white crystalline mgeh which contain the geh anion the germanium hydrohalides with one two and three halogen atoms are colorless reactive liquids the first organogermanium compound was synthesized by winkler in the reaction of germanium tetrachloride with diethylzinc yielded tetraethylgermane ge c h organogermanes of the type r ge where r is an alkyl such as tetramethylgermane ge ch and tetraethylgermane are accessed through the cheapest available germanium precursor germanium tetrachloride and alkyl nucleophiles organic germanium hydrides such as isobutylgermane ch chch geh were found to be less hazardous and may be used as a liquid substitute for toxic germane gas in semiconductor applications many germanium reactive intermediates are known germyl free radicals germylenes similar to carbenes and germynes similar to carbynes the organogermanium compound carboxyethylgermasesquioxane was first reported in the s and for a while was used as a dietary supplement and thought to possibly have anti tumor qualities using a ligand called eind octaethyl s hydrindacen yl germanium is able to form a double bond with oxygen germanone germanium hydride and germanium tetrahydride are very flammable and even explosive when mixed with air isotopes germanium occurs in natural isotopes ge ge ge ge and ge of these ge is very slightly radioactive decaying by double beta decay with a half life of years ge is the most common isotope having a natural abundance of approximately ge is the least common with a natural abundance of approximately when bombarded with alpha particles the isotope ge will generate stable se releasing high energy electrons in the process because of this it is used in combination with radon for nuclear batteries at least radioisotopes have also been synthesized ranging in atomic mass from to the most stable of these is ge decaying by electron capture with a half life of days the least stable is ge with a half life of ms while most of germanium s radioisotopes decay by beta decay ge and ge decay by delayed proton emission ge through ge isotopes also exhibit minor delayed neutron emission decay paths occurrence germanium is created by stellar nucleosynthesis mostly by the s process in asymptotic giant branch stars the s process is a slow neutron capture of lighter elements inside pulsating red giant stars germanium has been detected in some of the most distant stars and in the atmosphere of jupiter germanium s abundance in the earth s crust is approximately ppm only a few minerals like argyrodite briartite germanite renierite and sphalerite contain appreciable amounts of germanium only few of them especially germanite are very rarely found in mineable amounts some zinc copper lead ore bodies contain enough germanium to justify extraction from the final ore concentrate an unusual natural enrichment process causes a high content of germanium in some coal seams discovered by victor moritz goldschmidt during a broad survey for germanium deposits the highest concentration ever found was in hartley coal ash with as much as germanium the coal deposits near xilinhaote inner mongolia contain an estimated tonnes of germanium production about tonnes of germanium were produced in worldwide mostly in china t russia t and united states t germanium is recovered as a by product from sphalerite zinc ores where it is concentrated in amounts as great as especially from low temperature sediment hosted massive zn pb cu ba deposits and carbonate hosted zn pb deposits a recent study found that at least t of extractable germanium is contained in known zinc reserves particularly those hosted by mississippi valley type deposits while at least t will be found in coal reserves in of the demand was met by recycled germanium while it is produced mainly from sphalerite it is also found in silver lead and copper ores another source of germanium is fly ash of power plants fueled from coal deposits that contain germanium russia and china used this as a source for germanium russia s deposits are located in the far east of sakhalin island and northeast of vladivostok the deposits in china are located mainly in the lignite mines near lincang yunnan coal is also mined near xilinhaote inner mongolia the ore concentrates are mostly sulfidic they are converted to the oxides by heating under air in a process known as roasting ges o geo so some of the germanium is left in the dust produced while the rest is converted to germanates which are then leached together with zinc from the cinder by sulfuric acid after neutralization only the zinc stays in solution while germanium and other metals precipitate after removing some of the zinc in the precipitate by the waelz process the residing waelz oxide is leached a second time the dioxide is obtained as precipitate and converted with chlorine gas or hydrochloric acid to germanium tetrachloride which has a low boiling point and can be isolated by distillation geo hcl gecl h o geo cl gecl o germanium tetrachloride is either hydrolyzed to the oxide geo or purified by fractional distillation and then hydrolyzed the highly pure geo is now suitable for the production of germanium glass it is reduced to the element by reacting it with hydrogen producing germanium suitable for infrared optics and semiconductor production geo h ge h othe germanium for steel production and other industrial processes is normally reduced using carbon geo c ge co applications the major end uses for germanium in worldwide were estimated to be for fiber optics infrared optics polymerization catalysts and electronics and solar electric applications the remaining went into such uses as phosphors metallurgy and chemotherapy optics the notable properties of germania geo are its high index of refraction and its low optical dispersion these make it especially useful for wide angle camera lenses microscopy and the core part of optical fibers it has replaced titania as the dopant for silica fiber eliminating the subsequent heat treatment that made the fibers brittle at the end of the fiber optics industry consumed of the annual germanium use in the united states but this is less than of worldwide consumption gesbte is a phase change material used for its optic properties such as that used in rewritable dvds because germanium is transparent in the infrared wavelengths it is an important infrared optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows it is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the to micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot spot detection in military mobile night vision and fire fighting applications it is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors it has a very high refractive index and must be coated with anti reflection agents particularly a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond like carbon dlc refractive index is a good match and produces a diamond hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse electronics germanium can be alloyed with silicon and silicon germanium alloys are rapidly becoming an important semiconductor material for high speed integrated circuits circuits utilizing the properties of si sige heterojunctions can be much faster than those using silicon alone silicon germanium is beginning to replace gallium arsenide gaas in wireless communications devices the sige chips with high speed properties can be made with low cost well established production techniques of the silicon chip industry high efficiency solar panels are a major use of germanium because germanium and gallium arsenide have nearly identical lattice constant germanium substrates can be used to make gallium arsenide solar cells germanium is the substrate of the wafers for high efficiency multijunction photovoltaic cells for space applications such as the mars exploration rovers which use triple junction gallium arsenide on germanium cells high brightness leds used for automobile headlights and to backlight lcd screens are also an important application germanium on insulator geoi substrates are seen as a potential replacement for silicon on miniaturized chips cmos circuit based on geoi substrates has been reported recently other uses in electronics include phosphors in fluorescent lamps and solid state light emitting diodes leds germanium transistors are still used in some effects pedals by musicians who wish to reproduce the distinctive tonal character of the fuzz tone from the early rock and roll era most notably the dallas arbiter fuzz face other uses germanium dioxide is also used in catalysts for polymerization in the production of polyethylene terephthalate pet the high brilliance of this polyester is especially favored for pet bottles marketed in japan in the united states germanium is not used for polymerization catalysts due to the similarity between silica sio and germanium dioxide geo the silica stationary phase in some gas chromatography columns can be replaced by geo in recent years germanium has seen increasing use in precious metal alloys in sterling silver alloys for instance it reduces firescale increases tarnish resistance and improves precipitation hardening a tarnish proof silver alloy trademarked argentium contains germanium semiconductor detectors made of single crystal high purity germanium can precisely identify radiation sources for example in airport security germanium is useful for monochromators for beamlines used in single crystal neutron scattering and synchrotron x ray diffraction the reflectivity has advantages over silicon in neutron and high energy x ray applications crystals of high purity germanium are used in detectors for gamma spectroscopy and the search for dark matter germanium crystals are also used in x ray spectrometers for the determination of phosphorus chlorine and sulfur germanium is emerging as an important material for spintronics and spin based quantum computing applications in researchers demonstrated room temperature spin transport and more recently donor electron spins in germanium has been shown to have very long coherence times germanium and health germanium is not considered essential to the health of plants or animals germanium in the environment has little or no health impact this is primarily because it usually occurs only as a trace element in ores and carbonaceous materials and the various industrial and electronic applications involve very small quantities that are not likely to be ingested for similar reasons end use germanium has little impact on the environment as a biohazard some reactive intermediate compounds of germanium are poisonous see precautions below germanium supplements made from both organic and inorganic germanium have been marketed as an alternative medicine capable of treating leukemia and lung cancer there is however no medical evidence of benefit some evidence suggests that such supplements are actively harmful u s food and drug administration research has concluded that inorganic germanium when used as a nutritional supplement presents potential human health hazard some germanium compounds have been administered by alternative medical practitioners as non fda allowed injectable solutions soluble inorganic forms of germanium used at first notably the citrate lactate salt resulted in some cases of renal dysfunction hepatic steatosis and peripheral neuropathy in individuals using them over a long term plasma and urine germanium concentrations in these individuals several of whom died were several orders of magnitude greater than endogenous levels a more recent organic form beta carboxyethylgermanium sesquioxide propagermanium has not exhibited the same spectrum of toxic effects certain compounds of germanium have low toxicity to mammals but have toxic effects against certain bacteria precautions for chemically reactive germanium compounds while use of germanium itself does not require precautions some of germanium s artificially produced compounds are quite reactive and present an immediate hazard to human health on exposure for example germanium chloride and germane geh are a liquid and gas respectively that can be very irritating to the eyes skin lungs and throat ,32
Arsenic,As,arsenic is a chemical element with the symbol as and atomic number arsenic occurs in many minerals usually in combination with sulfur and metals but also as a pure elemental crystal arsenic is a metalloid it has various allotropes but only the gray form which has a metallic appearance is important to industry the primary use of arsenic is in alloys of lead for example in car batteries and ammunition arsenic is a common n type dopant in semiconductor electronic devices it is also a component of the iii v compound semiconductor gallium arsenide arsenic and its compounds especially the trioxide are used in the production of pesticides treated wood products herbicides and insecticides these applications are declining with the increasing recognition of the toxicity of arsenic and its compounds a few species of bacteria are able to use arsenic compounds as respiratory metabolites trace quantities of arsenic are an essential dietary element in rats hamsters goats chickens and presumably other species a role in human metabolism is not known however arsenic poisoning occurs in multicellular life if quantities are larger than needed arsenic contamination of groundwater is a problem that affects millions of people across the world the united states environmental protection agency states that all forms of arsenic are a serious risk to human health the united states agency for toxic substances and disease registry ranked arsenic as number in its priority list of hazardous substances at superfund sites arsenic is classified as a group a carcinogen characteristics physical characteristics the three most common arsenic allotropes are gray yellow and black arsenic with gray being the most common gray arsenic as space group r m no adopts a double layered structure consisting of many interlocked ruffled six membered rings because of weak bonding between the layers gray arsenic is brittle and has a relatively low mohs hardness of nearest and next nearest neighbors form a distorted octahedral complex with the three atoms in the same double layer being slightly closer than the three atoms in the next this relatively close packing leads to a high density of g cm gray arsenic is a semimetal but becomes a semiconductor with a bandgap of ev if amorphized gray arsenic is also the most stable form yellow arsenic is soft and waxy and somewhat similar to tetraphosphorus p both have four atoms arranged in a tetrahedral structure in which each atom is bound to each of the other three atoms by a single bond this unstable allotrope being molecular is the most volatile least dense and most toxic solid yellow arsenic is produced by rapid cooling of arsenic vapor as it is rapidly transformed into gray arsenic by light the yellow form has a density of g cm black arsenic is similar in structure to black phosphorus black arsenic can also be formed by cooling vapor at around c and by crystallization of amorphous arsenic in the presence of mercury vapors it is glassy and brittle black arsenic is also a poor electrical conductor as arsenic s triple point is at mpa atm it does not have a melting point at standard pressure but instead sublimes from solid to vapor at k c or f isotopes arsenic occurs in nature as one stable isotope as a monoisotopic element as of at least radioisotopes have also been synthesized ranging in atomic mass from to the most stable of these is as with a half life of days all other isotopes have half lives of under one day with the exception of as t hours as t hours as t days as t days and as t hours isotopes that are lighter than the stable as tend to decay by decay and those that are heavier tend to decay by decay with some exceptions at least nuclear isomers have been described ranging in atomic mass from to the most stable of arsenic s isomers is mas with a half life of seconds chemistry arsenic has a similar electronegativity and ionization energies to its lighter congener phosphorus and accordingly readily forms covalent molecules with most of the nonmetals though stable in dry air arsenic forms a golden bronze tarnish upon exposure to humidity which eventually becomes a black surface layer when heated in air arsenic oxidizes to arsenic trioxide the fumes from this reaction have an odor resembling garlic this odor can be detected on striking arsenide minerals such as arsenopyrite with a hammer it burns in oxygen to form arsenic trioxide and arsenic pentoxide which have the same structure as the more well known phosphorus compounds and in fluorine to give arsenic pentafluoride arsenic and some arsenic compounds sublimes upon heating at atmospheric pressure converting directly to a gaseous form without an intervening liquid state at k c the triple point is mpa and k c arsenic makes arsenic acid with concentrated nitric acid arsenous acid with dilute nitric acid and arsenic trioxide with concentrated sulfuric acid however it does not react with water alkalis or non oxidising acids arsenic reacts with metals to form arsenides though these are not ionic compounds containing the as ion as the formation of such an anion would be highly endothermic and even the group arsenides have properties of intermetallic compounds like germanium selenium and bromine which like arsenic succeed the d transition series arsenic is much less stable in the group oxidation state of than its vertical neighbors phosphorus and antimony and hence arsenic pentoxide and arsenic acid are potent oxidizers compounds compounds of arsenic resemble in some respects those of phosphorus which occupies the same group column of the periodic table the most common oxidation states for arsenic are in the arsenides which are alloy like intermetallic compounds in the arsenites and in the arsenates and most organoarsenic compounds arsenic also bonds readily to itself as seen in the square as ions in the mineral skutterudite in the oxidation state arsenic is typically pyramidal owing to the influence of the lone pair of electrons inorganic compounds one of the simplest arsenic compounds is the trihydride the highly toxic flammable pyrophoric arsine ash this compound is generally regarded as stable since at room temperature it decomposes only slowly at temperatures of c decomposition to arsenic and hydrogen is rapid several factors such as humidity presence of light and certain catalysts namely aluminium facilitate the rate of decomposition it oxidises readily in air to form arsenic trioxide and water and analogous reactions take place with sulfur and selenium instead of oxygen arsenic forms colorless odorless crystalline oxides as o white arsenic and as o which are hygroscopic and readily soluble in water to form acidic solutions arsenic v acid is a weak acid and the salts are called arsenates the most common arsenic contamination of groundwater and a problem that affects many people synthetic arsenates include scheele s green cupric hydrogen arsenate acidic copper arsenate calcium arsenate and lead hydrogen arsenate these three have been used as agricultural insecticides and poisons the protonation steps between the arsenate and arsenic acid are similar to those between phosphate and phosphoric acid unlike phosphorous acid arsenous acid is genuinely tribasic with the formula as oh a broad variety of sulfur compounds of arsenic are known orpiment as s and realgar as s are somewhat abundant and were formerly used as painting pigments in as s arsenic has a formal oxidation state of in as s which features as as bonds so that the total covalency of as is still both orpiment and realgar as well as as s have selenium analogs the analogous as te is known as the mineral kalgoorlieite and the anion as te is known as a ligand in cobalt complexes all trihalides of arsenic iii are well known except the astatide which is unknown arsenic pentafluoride asf is the only important pentahalide reflecting the lower stability of the oxidation state even so it is a very strong fluorinating and oxidizing agent the pentachloride is stable only below c at which temperature it decomposes to the trichloride releasing chlorine gas alloys arsenic is used as the group element in the iii v semiconductors gallium arsenide indium arsenide and aluminium arsenide the valence electron count of gaas is the same as a pair of si atoms but the band structure is completely different which results in distinct bulk properties other arsenic alloys include the ii v semiconductor cadmium arsenide organoarsenic compounds a large variety of organoarsenic compounds are known several were developed as chemical warfare agents during world war i including vesicants such as lewisite and vomiting agents such as adamsite cacodylic acid which is of historic and practical interest arises from the methylation of arsenic trioxide a reaction that has no analogy in phosphorus chemistry cacodyl was the first organometallic compound known even though arsenic is not a true metal and was named from the greek stink for its offensive odor it is very poisonous occurrence and production arsenic comprises about ppm of the earth s crust and is the rd most abundant element typical background concentrations of arsenic do not exceed ng m in the atmosphere mg kg in soil g kg in vegetation g l in freshwater and g l in seawater minerals with the formula mass and mas m fe ni co are the dominant commercial sources of arsenic together with realgar an arsenic sulfide mineral and native elemental arsenic an illustrative mineral is arsenopyrite feass which is structurally related to iron pyrite many minor as containing minerals are known arsenic also occurs in various organic forms in the environment in china was the top producer of white arsenic with almost world share followed by morocco russia and belgium according to the british geological survey and the united states geological survey most arsenic refinement operations in the us and europe have closed over environmental concerns arsenic is found in the smelter dust from copper gold and lead smelters and is recovered primarily from copper refinement dust on roasting arsenopyrite in air arsenic sublimes as arsenic iii oxide leaving iron oxides while roasting without air results in the production of gray arsenic further purification from sulfur and other chalcogens is achieved by sublimation in vacuum in a hydrogen atmosphere or by distillation from molten lead arsenic mixture history the word arsenic has its origin in the syriac word al zarniqa from arabic al zarn the orpiment based on persian zar gold from the word zarnikh meaning yellow literally gold colored and hence yellow orpiment it was adopted into greek as arsenikon a form that is folk etymology being the neuter form of the greek word arsenikos meaning male virile the greek word was adopted in latin as arsenicum which in french became arsenic from which the english word arsenic is taken arsenic sulfides orpiment realgar and oxides have been known and used since ancient times zosimos circa ad describes roasting sandarach realgar to obtain cloud of arsenic arsenic trioxide which he then reduces to gray arsenic as the symptoms of arsenic poisoning are not very specific it was frequently used for murder until the advent of the marsh test a sensitive chemical test for its presence another less sensitive but more general test is the reinsch test owing to its use by the ruling class to murder one another and its potency and discreetness arsenic has been called the poison of kings and the king of poisons in the renaissance era arsenic was known as inheritance powder due to use in killing family members during the bronze age arsenic was often included in bronze which made the alloy harder so called arsenical bronze the isolation of arsenic was described by jabir ibn hayyan before ad albertus magnus albert the great later isolated the element from a compound in by heating soap together with arsenic trisulfide in johann schr der published two ways of preparing arsenic crystals of elemental native arsenic are found in nature although rare cadet s fuming liquid impure cacodyl often claimed as the first synthetic organometallic compound was synthesized in by louis claude cadet de gassicourt by the reaction of potassium acetate with arsenic trioxide in the victorian era arsenic white arsenic or arsenic trioxide was mixed with vinegar and chalk and eaten by women to improve the complexion of their faces making their skin paler to show they did not work in the fields the accidental use of arsenic in the adulteration of foodstuffs led to the bradford sweet poisoning in which resulted in deaths wallpaper production also began to use dyes made from arsenic which was thought to increase the pigment s brightness two arsenic pigments have been widely used since their discovery paris green and scheele s green after the toxicity of arsenic became widely known these chemicals were used less often as pigments and more often as insecticides in the s an arsenic byproduct of dye production london purple was widely used this was a solid mixture of arsenic trioxide aniline lime and ferrous oxide insoluble in water and very toxic by inhalation or ingestion but it was later replaced with paris green another arsenic based dye with better understanding of the toxicology mechanism two other compounds were used starting in the s arsenite of lime and arsenate of lead were used widely as insecticides until the discovery of ddt in applications agricultural the toxicity of arsenic to insects bacteria and fungi led to its use as a wood preservative in the s a process of treating wood with chromated copper arsenate also known as cca or tanalith was invented and for decades this treatment was the most extensive industrial use of arsenic an increased appreciation of the toxicity of arsenic led to a ban of cca in consumer products in initiated by the european union and united states however cca remains in heavy use in other countries such as on malaysian rubber plantations arsenic was also used in various agricultural insecticides and poisons for example lead hydrogen arsenate was a common insecticide on fruit trees but contact with the compound sometimes resulted in brain damage among those working the sprayers in the second half of the th century monosodium methyl arsenate msma and disodium methyl arsenate dsma less toxic organic forms of arsenic replaced lead arsenate in agriculture these organic arsenicals were in turn phased out by in all agricultural activities except cotton farming the biogeochemistry of arsenic is complex and includes various adsorption and desorption processes the toxicity of arsenic is connected to its solubility and is affected by ph arsenite aso is more soluble than arsenate aso and is more toxic however at a lower ph arsenate becomes more mobile and toxic it was found that addition of sulfur phosphorus and iron oxides to high arsenite soils greatly reduces arsenic phytotoxicity arsenic is used as a feed additive in poultry and swine production in particular in the u s to increase weight gain improve feed efficiency and prevent disease an example is roxarsone which had been used as a broiler starter by about of u s broiler growers alpharma a subsidiary of pfizer inc which produces roxarsone voluntarily suspended sales of the drug in response to studies showing elevated levels of inorganic arsenic a carcinogen in treated chickens a successor to alpharma zoetis continues to sell nitarsone primarily for use in turkeys arsenic is intentionally added to the feed of chickens raised for human consumption organic arsenic compounds are less toxic than pure arsenic and promote the growth of chickens under some conditions the arsenic in chicken feed is converted to the toxic inorganic form a study of the remains of the australian racehorse phar lap determined that the death of the famous champion was caused by a massive overdose of arsenic sydney veterinarian percy sykes stated in those days arsenic was quite a common tonic usually given in the form of a solution fowler s solution it was so common that i d reckon per cent of the horses had arsenic in their system medical use during the th th and th centuries a number of arsenic compounds were used as medicines including arsphenamine by paul ehrlich and arsenic trioxide by thomas fowler arsphenamine as well as neosalvarsan was indicated for syphilis but has been superseded by modern antibiotics however arsenicals such as melarsoprol are still used for the treatment of trypanosomiasis since although these drugs have the disadvantage of severe toxicity the disease is almost uniformly fatal if untreated arsenic trioxide has been used in a variety of ways since the th century most commonly in the treatment of cancer but also in medications as diverse as fowler s solution in psoriasis the us food and drug administration in the year approved this compound for the treatment of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia that is resistant to all trans retinoic acid a paper reports success in locating tumors using arsenic a positron emitter this isotope produces clearer pet scan images than the previous radioactive agent iodine because the body tends to transport iodine to the thyroid gland producing signal noise nanoparticles of arsenic have shown ability to kill cancer cells with lesser cytotoxicity than other arsenic formulations in subtoxic doses soluble arsenic compounds act as stimulants and were once popular in small doses as medicine by people in the mid th to th centuries its use as a stimulant was especially prevalent as sport animals such as race horses or with work dogs alloys the main use of arsenic is in alloying with lead lead components in car batteries are strengthened by the presence of a very small percentage of arsenic dezincification of brass a copper zinc alloy is greatly reduced by the addition of arsenic phosphorus deoxidized arsenical copper with an arsenic content of has an increased corrosion stability in certain environments gallium arsenide is an important semiconductor material used in integrated circuits circuits made from gaas are much faster but also much more expensive than those made from silicon unlike silicon gaas has a direct bandgap and can be used in laser diodes and leds to convert electrical energy directly into light military after world war i the united states built a stockpile of tons of weaponized lewisite clch chascl an organoarsenic vesicant blister agent and lung irritant the stockpile was neutralized with bleach and dumped into the gulf of mexico in the s during the vietnam war the united states used agent blue a mixture of sodium cacodylate and its acid form as one of the rainbow herbicides to deprive north vietnamese soldiers of foliage cover and rice other uses copper acetoarsenite was used as a green pigment known under many names including paris green and emerald green it caused numerous arsenic poisonings scheele s green a copper arsenate was used in the th century as a coloring agent in sweets arsenic is used in bronzing and pyrotechnics as much as of produced arsenic is used in lead alloys for lead shot and bullets arsenic is added in small quantities to alpha brass to make it dezincification resistant this grade of brass is used in plumbing fittings and other wet environments arsenic is also used for taxonomic sample preservation it was also used in embalming fluids historically arsenic was used as an opacifier in ceramics creating white glazes until recently arsenic was used in optical glass modern glass manufacturers under pressure from environmentalists have ceased using both arsenic and lead in computers arsenic is used in the chips as the n type doping biological role bacteria some species of bacteria obtain their energy in the absence of oxygen by oxidizing various fuels while reducing arsenate to arsenite under oxidative environmental conditions some bacteria use arsenite as fuel which they oxidize to arsenate the enzymes involved are known as arsenate reductases arr in bacteria were discovered that employ a version of photosynthesis in the absence of oxygen with arsenites as electron donors producing arsenates just as ordinary photosynthesis uses water as electron donor producing molecular oxygen researchers conjecture that over the course of history these photosynthesizing organisms produced the arsenates that allowed the arsenate reducing bacteria to thrive one strain phs has been isolated and is related to the gammaproteobacterium ectothiorhodospira shaposhnikovii the mechanism is unknown but an encoded arr enzyme may function in reverse to its known homologues in it was postulated that a strain of halomonadaceae could be grown in the absence of phosphorus if that element were substituted with arsenic exploiting the fact that the arsenate and phosphate anions are similar structurally the study was widely criticised and subsequently refuted by independent researcher groups essential trace element in higher animals some evidence indicates that arsenic is an essential trace mineral in birds chickens and in mammals rats hamsters and goats however the biological function is not known heredity arsenic has been linked to epigenetic changes heritable changes in gene expression that occur without changes in dna sequence these include dna methylation histone modification and rna interference toxic levels of arsenic cause significant dna hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes p and p thus increasing risk of carcinogenesis these epigenetic events have been studied in vitro using human kidney cells and in vivo using rat liver cells and peripheral blood leukocytes in humans inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms is used to detect precise levels of intracellular arsenic and other arsenic bases involved in epigenetic modification of dna studies investigating arsenic as an epigenetic factor can be used to develop precise biomarkers of exposure and susceptibility the chinese brake fern pteris vittata hyperaccumulates arsenic from the soil into its leaves and has a proposed use in phytoremediation biomethylation inorganic arsenic and its compounds upon entering the food chain are progressively metabolized through a process of methylation for example the mold scopulariopsis brevicaulis produces trimethylarsine if inorganic arsenic is present the organic compound arsenobetaine is found in some marine foods such as fish and algae and also in mushrooms in larger concentrations the average person s intake is about g day values about g are not unusual following consumption of fish or mushrooms but there is little danger in eating fish because this arsenic compound is nearly non toxic environmental issues exposure naturally occurring sources of human exposure include volcanic ash weathering of minerals and ores and mineralized groundwater arsenic is also found in food water soil and air arsenic is absorbed by all plants but is more concentrated in leafy vegetables rice apple and grape juice and seafood an additional route of exposure is inhalation of atmospheric gases and dusts during the victorian era arsenic was widely used in home decor especially wallpapers occurrence in drinking water extensive arsenic contamination of groundwater has led to widespread arsenic poisoning in bangladesh and neighboring countries it is estimated that approximately million people in the bengal basin are drinking groundwater with arsenic concentrations elevated above the world health organization s standard of parts per billion ppb however a study of cancer rates in taiwan suggested that significant increases in cancer mortality appear only at levels above ppb the arsenic in the groundwater is of natural origin and is released from the sediment into the groundwater caused by the anoxic conditions of the subsurface this groundwater was used after local and western ngos and the bangladeshi government undertook a massive shallow tube well drinking water program in the late twentieth century this program was designed to prevent drinking of bacteria contaminated surface waters but failed to test for arsenic in the groundwater many other countries and districts in southeast asia such as vietnam and cambodia have geological environments that produce groundwater with a high arsenic content arsenicosis was reported in nakhon si thammarat thailand in and the chao phraya river probably contains high levels of naturally occurring dissolved arsenic without being a public health problem because much of the public uses bottled water in pakistan more than million people are exposed to arsenic polluted drinking water indicated by a recent report of science podgorski s team investigated more than samples and more than exceeded the who minimum contamination level since the s residents of the ba men region of inner mongolia china have been chronically exposed to arsenic through drinking water from contaminated wells a research study observed an elevated presence of skin lesions among residents with well water arsenic concentrations between and g l suggesting that arsenic induced toxicity may occur at relatively low concentrations with chronic exposure overall of china s provinces have high arsenic concentrations in the groundwater supply potentially exposing million people to hazardous drinking water in the united states arsenic is most commonly found in the ground waters of the southwest parts of new england michigan wisconsin minnesota and the dakotas are also known to have significant concentrations of arsenic in ground water increased levels of skin cancer have been associated with arsenic exposure in wisconsin even at levels below the part per billion drinking water standard according to a recent film funded by the us superfund millions of private wells have unknown arsenic levels and in some areas of the us more than of the wells may contain levels that exceed established limits low level exposure to arsenic at concentrations of parts per billion i e above the parts per billion drinking water standard compromises the initial immune response to h n or swine flu infection according to niehs supported scientists the study conducted in laboratory mice suggests that people exposed to arsenic in their drinking water may be at increased risk for more serious illness or death from the virus some canadians are drinking water that contains inorganic arsenic private dug well waters are most at risk for containing inorganic arsenic preliminary well water analysis typically does not test for arsenic researchers at the geological survey of canada have modeled relative variation in natural arsenic hazard potential for the province of new brunswick this study has important implications for potable water and health concerns relating to inorganic arsenic epidemiological evidence from chile shows a dose dependent connection between chronic arsenic exposure and various forms of cancer in particular when other risk factors such as cigarette smoking are present these effects have been demonstrated at contaminations less than ppb arsenic is itself a constituent of tobacco smoke analyzing multiple epidemiological studies on inorganic arsenic exposure suggests a small but measurable increase in risk for bladder cancer at ppb according to peter ravenscroft of the department of geography at the university of cambridge roughly million people worldwide consume between and ppb arsenic in their drinking water if they all consumed exactly ppb arsenic in their drinking water the previously cited multiple epidemiological study analysis would predict an additional cases of bladder cancer alone this represents a clear underestimate of the overall impact since it does not include lung or skin cancer and explicitly underestimates the exposure those exposed to levels of arsenic above the current who standard should weigh the costs and benefits of arsenic remediation early evaluations of the processes for removing dissolved arsenic from drinking water demonstrated the efficacy of co precipitation with either iron or aluminum oxides in particular iron as a coagulant was found to remove arsenic with an efficacy exceeding several adsorptive media systems have been approved for use at point of service in a study funded by the united states environmental protection agency us epa and the national science foundation nsf a team of european and indian scientists and engineers have set up six arsenic treatment plants in west bengal based on in situ remediation method sar technology this technology does not use any chemicals and arsenic is left in an insoluble form state in the subterranean zone by recharging aerated water into the aquifer and developing an oxidation zone that supports arsenic oxidizing micro organisms this process does not produce any waste stream or sludge and is relatively cheap another effective and inexpensive method to avoid arsenic contamination is to sink wells feet or deeper to reach purer waters a recent study funded by the us national institute of environmental health sciences superfund research program shows that deep sediments can remove arsenic and take it out of circulation in this process called adsorption arsenic sticks to the surfaces of deep sediment particles and is naturally removed from the ground water magnetic separations of arsenic at very low magnetic field gradients with high surface area and monodisperse magnetite fe o nanocrystals have been demonstrated in point of use water purification using the high specific surface area of fe o nanocrystals the mass of waste associated with arsenic removal from water has been dramatically reduced epidemiological studies have suggested a correlation between chronic consumption of drinking water contaminated with arsenic and the incidence of all leading causes of mortality the literature indicates that arsenic exposure is causative in the pathogenesis of diabetes chaff based filters have recently been shown to reduce the arsenic content of water to g l this may find applications in areas where the potable water is extracted from underground aquifers san pedro de atacama for several centuries the people of san pedro de atacama in chile have been drinking water that is contaminated with arsenic and some evidence suggests they have developed some immunity hazard maps for contaminated groundwater around one third of the world s population drinks water from groundwater resources of this about percent approximately million people obtains water from groundwater resources that are contaminated with unhealthy levels of arsenic or fluoride these trace elements derive mainly from minerals and ions in the ground redox transformation of arsenic in natural waters arsenic is unique among the trace metalloids and oxyanion forming trace metals e g as se sb mo v cr u re it is sensitive to mobilization at ph values typical of natural waters ph under both oxidizing and reducing conditions arsenic can occur in the environment in several oxidation states and but in natural waters it is mostly found in inorganic forms as oxyanions of trivalent arsenite as iii or pentavalent arsenate as v organic forms of arsenic are produced by biological activity mostly in surface waters but are rarely quantitatively important organic arsenic compounds may however occur where waters are significantly impacted by industrial pollution arsenic may be solubilized by various processes when ph is high arsenic may be released from surface binding sites that lose their positive charge when water level drops and sulfide minerals are exposed to air arsenic trapped in sulfide minerals can be released into water when organic carbon is present in water bacteria are fed by directly reducing as v to as iii or by reducing the element at the binding site releasing inorganic arsenic the aquatic transformations of arsenic are affected by ph reduction oxidation potential organic matter concentration and the concentrations and forms of other elements especially iron and manganese the main factors are ph and the redox potential generally the main forms of arsenic under oxic conditions are h aso h aso haso and aso at ph and respectively under reducing conditions h aso is predominant at ph oxidation and reduction affects the migration of arsenic in subsurface environments arsenite is the most stable soluble form of arsenic in reducing environments and arsenate which is less mobile than arsenite is dominant in oxidizing environments at neutral ph therefore arsenic may be more mobile under reducing conditions the reducing environment is also rich in organic matter which may enhance the solubility of arsenic compounds as a result the adsorption of arsenic is reduced and dissolved arsenic accumulates in groundwater that is why the arsenic content is higher in reducing environments than in oxidizing environments the presence of sulfur is another factor that affects the transformation of arsenic in natural water arsenic can precipitate when metal sulfides form in this way arsenic is removed from the water and its mobility decreases when oxygen is present bacteria oxidize reduced sulfur to generate energy potentially releasing bound arsenic redox reactions involving fe also appear to be essential factors in the fate of arsenic in aquatic systems the reduction of iron oxyhydroxides plays a key role in the release of arsenic to water so arsenic can be enriched in water with elevated fe concentrations under oxidizing conditions arsenic can be mobilized from pyrite or iron oxides especially at elevated ph under reducing conditions arsenic can be mobilized by reductive desorption or dissolution when associated with iron oxides the reductive desorption occurs under two circumstances one is when arsenate is reduced to arsenite which adsorbs to iron oxides less strongly the other results from a change in the charge on the mineral surface which leads to the desorption of bound arsenic some species of bacteria catalyze redox transformations of arsenic dissimilatory arsenate respiring prokaryotes darp speed up the reduction of as v to as iii darp use as v as the electron acceptor of anaerobic respiration and obtain energy to survive other organic and inorganic substances can be oxidized in this process chemoautotrophic arsenite oxidizers cao and heterotrophic arsenite oxidizers hao convert as iii into as v cao combine the oxidation of as iii with the reduction of oxygen or nitrate they use obtained energy to fix produce organic carbon from co hao cannot obtain energy from as iii oxidation this process may be an arsenic detoxification mechanism for the bacteria equilibrium thermodynamic calculations predict that as v concentrations should be greater than as iii concentrations in all but strongly reducing conditions i e where so reduction is occurring however abiotic redox reactions of arsenic are slow oxidation of as iii by dissolved o is a particularly slow reaction for example johnson and pilson gave half lives for the oxygenation of as iii in seawater ranging from several months to a year in other studies as v as iii ratios were stable over periods of days or weeks during water sampling when no particular care was taken to prevent oxidation again suggesting relatively slow oxidation rates cherry found from experimental studies that the as v as iii ratios were stable in anoxic solutions for up to weeks but that gradual changes occurred over longer timescales sterile water samples have been observed to be less susceptible to speciation changes than non sterile samples oremland found that the reduction of as v to as iii in mono lake was rapidly catalyzed by bacteria with rate constants ranging from to day wood preservation in the us as of us based industries consumed metric tons of arsenic ninety percent of this was used for treatment of wood with chromated copper arsenate cca in of the metric tons of consumption was still used for this purpose in the united states the voluntary phasing out of arsenic in production of consumer products and residential and general consumer construction products began on december and alternative chemicals are now used such as alkaline copper quaternary borates copper azole cyproconazole and propiconazole although discontinued this application is also one of the most concerning to the general public the vast majority of older pressure treated wood was treated with cca cca lumber is still in widespread use in many countries and was heavily used during the latter half of the th century as a structural and outdoor building material although the use of cca lumber was banned in many areas after studies showed that arsenic could leach out of the wood into the surrounding soil from playground equipment for instance a risk is also presented by the burning of older cca timber the direct or indirect ingestion of wood ash from burnt cca lumber has caused fatalities in animals and serious poisonings in humans the lethal human dose is approximately grams of ash scrap cca lumber from construction and demolition sites may be inadvertently used in commercial and domestic fires protocols for safe disposal of cca lumber are not consistent throughout the world widespread landfill disposal of such timber raises some concern but other studies have shown no arsenic contamination in the groundwater mapping of industrial releases in the us one tool that maps the location and other information of arsenic releases in the united states is toxmap toxmap is a geographic information system gis from the division of specialized information services of the united states national library of medicine nlm funded by the us federal government with marked up maps of the united states toxmap enables users to visually explore data from the united states environmental protection agency s epa toxics release inventory and superfund basic research programs toxmap s chemical and environmental health information is taken from nlm s toxicology data network toxnet pubmed and from other authoritative sources bioremediation physical chemical and biological methods have been used to remediate arsenic contaminated water bioremediation is said to be cost effective and environmentally friendly bioremediation of ground water contaminated with arsenic aims to convert arsenite the toxic form of arsenic to humans to arsenate arsenate oxidation state is the dominant form of arsenic in surface water while arsenite oxidation state is the dominant form in hypoxic to anoxic environments arsenite is more soluble and mobile than arsenate many species of bacteria can transform arsenite to arsenate in anoxic conditions by using arsenite as an electron donor this is a useful method in ground water remediation another bioremediation strategy is to use plants that accumulate arsenic in their tissues via phytoremediation but the disposal of contaminated plant material needs to be considered bioremediation requires careful evaluation and design in accordance with existing conditions some sites may require the addition of an electron acceptor while others require microbe supplementation bioaugmentation regardless of the method used only constant monitoring can prevent future contamination toxicity and precautions arsenic and many of its compounds are especially potent poisons small amount of arsenic can be detected by pharmacopoial methods which includes reduction of arsenic to arsenious with help of zinc and can be confirmed with mercuric chloride paper classification elemental arsenic and arsenic sulfate and trioxide compounds are classified as toxic and dangerous for the environment in the european union under directive eec the international agency for research on cancer iarc recognizes arsenic and inorganic arsenic compounds as group carcinogens and the eu lists arsenic trioxide arsenic pentoxide and arsenate salts as category carcinogens arsenic is known to cause arsenicosis when present in drinking water the most common species being arsenate haso as v and arsenite h aso as iii legal limits food and drink in the united states since the maximum concentration in drinking water allowed by the environmental protection agency epa is ppb and the fda set the same standard in for bottled water the department of environmental protection for new jersey set a drinking water limit of ppb in the idlh immediately dangerous to life and health value for arsenic metal and inorganic arsenic compounds is mg m ppb the occupational safety and health administration has set the permissible exposure limit pel to a time weighted average twa of mg m ppb and the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set the recommended exposure limit rel to a minute constant exposure of mg m ppb the pel for organic arsenic compounds is a twa of mg m ppb in based on its ongoing testing of a wide variety of american foods for toxic chemicals the u s food and drug administration set the level of concern for inorganic arsenic in apple and pear juices at ppb based on non carcinogenic effects and began blocking importation of products in excess of this level it also required recalls for non conforming domestic products in the national dr oz television show broadcast a program highlighting tests performed by an independent lab hired by the producers though the methodology was disputed it did not distinguish between organic and inorganic arsenic the tests showed levels of arsenic up to ppb in response fda tested the worst brand from the dr oz show and found much lower levels ongoing testing found of the apple juice samples were below the level of concern later testing by consumer reports showed inorganic arsenic at levels slightly above ppb and the organization urged parents to reduce consumption in july on consideration of consumption by children chronic exposure and carcinogenic effect the fda established an action level of ppb for apple juice the same as the drinking water standard concern about arsenic in rice in bangladesh was raised in but at the time only australia had a legal limit for food one milligram per kilogram concern was raised about people who were eating u s rice exceeding who standards for personal arsenic intake in in the people s republic of china set a food standard of ppb for arsenic in the united states in testing by separate groups of researchers at the children s environmental health and disease prevention research center at dartmouth college early in the year focusing on urinary levels in children and consumer reports in november found levels of arsenic in rice that resulted in calls for the fda to set limits the fda released some testing results in september and as of july is still collecting data in support of a new potential regulation it has not recommended any changes in consumer behavior consumer reports recommended that the epa and fda eliminate arsenic containing fertilizer drugs and pesticides in food production that the fda establish a legal limit for food that industry change production practices to lower arsenic levels especially in food for children and that consumers test home water supplies eat a varied diet and cook rice with excess water then draining it off reducing inorganic arsenic by about one third along with a slight reduction in vitamin content evidence based public health advocates also recommend that given the lack of regulation or labeling for arsenic in the u s children should eat no more than servings per week of rice and should not drink rice milk as part of their daily diet before age they also offer recommendations for adults and infants on how to limit arsenic exposure from rice drinking water and fruit juice a world health organization advisory conference was scheduled to consider limits of ppb for rice reducing arsenic content in rice in scientists assessed multiple preparation procedures of rice for their capacity to reduce arsenic content and preserve nutrients recommending a procedure involving parboiling and water absorption occupational exposure limits ecotoxicity arsenic is bioaccumulative in many organisms marine species in particular but it does not appear to biomagnify significantly in food webs in polluted areas plant growth may be affected by root uptake of arsenate which is a phosphate analog and therefore readily transported in plant tissues and cells in polluted areas uptake of the more toxic arsenite ion found more particularly in reducing conditions is likely in poorly drained soils toxicity in animals biological mechanism arsenic s toxicity comes from the affinity of arsenic iii oxides for thiols thiols in the form of cysteine residues and cofactors such as lipoic acid and coenzyme a are situated at the active sites of many important enzymes arsenic disrupts atp production through several mechanisms at the level of the citric acid cycle arsenic inhibits lipoic acid which is a cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase by competing with phosphate arsenate uncouples oxidative phosphorylation thus inhibiting energy linked reduction of nad mitochondrial respiration and atp synthesis hydrogen peroxide production is also increased which it is speculated has potential to form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress these metabolic interferences lead to death from multi system organ failure the organ failure is presumed to be from necrotic cell death not apoptosis since energy reserves have been too depleted for apoptosis to occur exposure risks and remediation occupational exposure and arsenic poisoning may occur in persons working in industries involving the use of inorganic arsenic and its compounds such as wood preservation glass production nonferrous metal alloys and electronic semiconductor manufacturing inorganic arsenic is also found in coke oven emissions associated with the smelter industry the conversion between as iii and as v is a large factor in arsenic environmental contamination according to croal gralnick malasarn and newman the understanding of what stimulates as iii oxidation and or limits as v reduction is relevant for bioremediation of contaminated sites croal the study of chemolithoautotrophic as iii oxidizers and the heterotrophic as v reducers can help the understanding of the oxidation and or reduction of arsenic treatment treatment of chronic arsenic poisoning is possible british anti lewisite dimercaprol is prescribed in doses of mg kg up to mg every hours for the first day then every hours for the second day and finally every hours for additional days however the usa s agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr states that the long term effects of arsenic exposure cannot be predicted blood urine hair and nails may be tested for arsenic however these tests cannot foresee possible health outcomes from the exposure long term exposure and consequent excretion through urine has been linked to bladder and kidney cancer in addition to cancer of the liver prostate skin lungs and nasal cavity ,33
Selenium,Se,selenium is a chemical element with the symbol se and atomic number it is a nonmetal more rarely considered a metalloid with properties that are intermediate between the elements above and below in the periodic table sulfur and tellurium and also has similarities to arsenic it seldom occurs in its elemental state or as pure ore compounds in the earth s crust selenium from greek sel n moon was discovered in by j ns jacob berzelius who noted the similarity of the new element to the previously discovered tellurium named for the earth selenium is found in metal sulfide ores where it partially replaces the sulfur commercially selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores most often during production minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are known but rare the chief commercial uses for selenium today are glassmaking and pigments selenium is a semiconductor and is used in photocells applications in electronics once important have been mostly replaced with silicon semiconductor devices selenium is still used in a few types of dc power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot although trace amounts of selenium are necessary for cellular function in many animals including humans both elemental selenium and especially selenium salts are toxic in even small doses causing selenosis selenium is listed as an ingredient in many multivitamins and other dietary supplements as well as in infant formula and is a component of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase which indirectly reduce certain oxidized molecules in animals and some plants as well as in deiodinase enzymes selenium requirements in plants differ by species with some plants requiring relatively large amounts and others apparently not requiring any characteristics physical properties selenium forms several allotropes that interconvert with temperature changes depending somewhat on the rate of temperature change when prepared in chemical reactions selenium is usually an amorphous brick red powder when rapidly melted it forms the black vitreous form usually sold commercially as beads the structure of black selenium is irregular and complex and consists of polymeric rings with up to atoms per ring black se is a brittle lustrous solid that is slightly soluble in cs upon heating it softens at c and converts to gray selenium at c the transformation temperature is reduced by presence of halogens and amines the red and forms are produced from solutions of black selenium by varying the evaporation rate of the solvent usually cs they all have a relatively low monoclinic crystal symmetry space group and contain nearly identical puckered se rings with different arrangements as in sulfur the eight atoms of a ring are not equivalent i e they are not mapped one onto another by any symmetry operation and in fact in the monoclinic form half the rings are in one configuration and its mirror image and half in another the packing is most dense in the form in the se rings the se se distance varies depending on where the pair of atoms is in the ring but the average is pm and the se se se angle is on average other selenium allotropes may contain se or se rings the most stable and dense form of selenium is gray and has a chiral hexagonal crystal lattice space group or depending on the chirality consisting of helical polymeric chains where the se se distance is pm and se se se angle is the minimum distance between chains is pm gray se is formed by mild heating of other allotropes by slow cooling of molten se or by condensing se vapor just below the melting point whereas other se forms are insulators gray se is a semiconductor showing appreciable photoconductivity unlike the other allotropes it is insoluble in cs it resists oxidation by air and is not attacked by nonoxidizing acids with strong reducing agents it forms polyselenides selenium does not exhibit the changes in viscosity that sulfur undergoes when gradually heated optical properties owing to its use as a photoconductor in flat panel x ray detectors see below the optical properties of amorphous selenium se thin films have been the subject of intense research isotopes selenium has seven naturally occurring isotopes five of these se se se se se are stable with se being the most abundant natural abundance also naturally occurring is the long lived primordial radionuclide se with a half life of years the non primordial radioisotope se also occurs in minute quantities in uranium ores as a product of nuclear fission selenium also has numerous unstable synthetic isotopes ranging from se to se the most stable are se with a half life of days and se with a half life of days isotopes lighter than the stable isotopes primarily undergo beta plus decay to isotopes of arsenic and isotopes heavier than the stable isotopes undergo beta minus decay to isotopes of bromine with some minor neutron emission branches in the heaviest known isotopes chemical compounds selenium compounds commonly exist in the oxidation states and chalcogen compounds selenium forms two oxides selenium dioxide

the only stable chloride is selenium monochloride se cl which might be better known as selenium i chloride the corresponding bromide is also known these species are structurally analogous to the corresponding disulfur dichloride selenium dichloride is an important reagent in the preparation of selenium compounds e g the preparation of se it is prepared by treating selenium with sulfuryl chloride so cl selenium reacts with fluorine to form selenium hexafluoride se f sef displaystyle ce se f sef in comparison with its sulfur counterpart sulfur hexafluoride selenium hexafluoride sef is more reactive and is a toxic pulmonary irritant some of the selenium oxyhalides such as selenium oxyfluoride seof and selenium oxychloride seocl have been used as specialty solvents selenides analogous to the behavior of other chalcogens selenium forms hydrogen selenide h se it is a strongly odiferous toxic and colorless gas it is more acidic than h s in solution it ionizes to hse the

selenides diselenides and selenols include respectively selenomethionine diphenyldiselenide and benzeneselenol the sulfoxide in sulfur chemistry is represented in selenium chemistry by the selenoxides formula rse o r which are intermediates in organic synthesis as illustrated by the selenoxide elimination reaction consistent with trends indicated by the double bond rule selenoketones r c se r and selenaldehydes r c se h are rarely observed history selenium greek selene meaning moon was discovered in by j ns jacob berzelius and johan gottlieb gahn both chemists owned a chemistry plant near gripsholm sweden producing sulfuric acid by the lead chamber process the pyrite from the falun mine created a red precipitate in the lead chambers which was presumed to be an arsenic compound so the pyrite s use to make acid was discontinued berzelius and gahn wanted to use the pyrite and they also observed that the red precipitate gave off a smell like horseradish when burned this smell was not typical of arsenic but a similar odor was known from tellurium compounds hence berzelius s first letter to alexander marcet stated that this was a tellurium compound however the lack of tellurium compounds in the falun mine minerals eventually led berzelius to reanalyze the red precipitate and in he wrote a second letter to marcet describing a newly found element similar to sulfur and tellurium because of its similarity to tellurium named for the earth berzelius named the new element after the moon in willoughby smith found that the electrical resistance of grey selenium was dependent on the ambient light this led to its use as a cell for sensing light the first commercial products using selenium were developed by werner siemens in the mid s the selenium cell was used in the photophone developed by alexander graham bell in selenium transmits an electric current proportional to the amount of light falling on its surface this phenomenon was used in the design of light meters and similar devices selenium s semiconductor properties found numerous other applications in electronics the development of selenium rectifiers began during the early s and these replaced copper oxide rectifiers because they were more efficient these lasted in commercial applications until the s following which they were replaced with less expensive and even more efficient silicon rectifiers selenium came to medical notice later because of its toxicity to industrial workers selenium was also recognized as an important veterinary toxin which is seen in animals that have eaten high selenium plants in the first hints of specific biological functions of selenium were discovered in microorganisms by biochemist jane pinsent it was discovered to be essential for mammalian life in in the s it was shown to be present in two independent sets of enzymes this was followed by the discovery of selenocysteine in proteins during the s selenocysteine was shown to be encoded by the codon uga the recoding mechanism was worked out first in bacteria and then in mammals see secis element occurrence native i e elemental selenium is a rare mineral which does not usually form good crystals but when it does they are steep rhombohedra or tiny acicular hair like crystals isolation of selenium is often complicated by the presence of other compounds and elements selenium occurs naturally in a number of inorganic forms including selenide selenate and selenite but these minerals are rare the common mineral selenite is not a selenium mineral and contains no selenite ion but is rather a type of gypsum calcium sulfate hydrate named like selenium for the moon well before the discovery of selenium selenium is most commonly found as an impurity replacing a small part of the sulfur in sulfide ores of many metals in living systems selenium is found in the amino acids selenomethionine selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine in these compounds selenium plays a role analogous to that of sulfur another naturally occurring organoselenium compound is dimethyl selenide certain soils are selenium rich and selenium can be bioconcentrated by some plants in soils selenium most often occurs in soluble forms such as selenate analogous to sulfate which are leached into rivers very easily by runoff ocean water contains significant amounts of selenium typical background concentrations of selenium do not exceed ng m in the atmosphere mg kg in soil and vegetation and g l in freshwater and seawater anthropogenic sources of selenium include coal burning and the mining and smelting of sulfide ores production selenium is most commonly produced from selenide in many sulfide ores such as those of copper nickel or lead electrolytic metal refining is particularly productive of selenium as a byproduct obtained from the anode mud of copper refineries another source was the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid plants a process that is no longer used selenium can be refined from these muds by a number of methods however most elemental selenium comes as a byproduct of refining copper or producing sulfuric acid since its invention solvent extraction and electrowinning sx ew production of copper produces an increasing share of the worldwide copper supply this changes the availability of selenium because only a comparably small part of the selenium in the ore is leached with the copper industrial production of selenium usually involves the extraction of selenium dioxide from residues obtained during the purification of copper common production from the residue then begins by oxidation with sodium carbonate to produce selenium dioxide which is mixed with water and acidified to form selenous acid oxidation step selenous acid is bubbled with sulfur dioxide reduction step to give elemental selenium about tonnes of selenium were produced in worldwide mostly in germany t japan t belgium t and russia t and the total reserves were estimated at tonnes these data exclude two major producers the united states and china a previous sharp increase was observed in from to lb the price was relatively stable during at about us per pound in pound lots but increased to lb in the consumption in was divided as follows metallurgy glass manufacturing agriculture chemicals and pigments and electronics china is the dominant consumer of selenium at tonnes year applications fertilizers researchers found that application of selenium fertilizer to lettuce crops decreased the accumulation of lead and cadmium peaches and pears given a foliar selenium spray contained higher levels of selenium and also stayed firm and ripe longer when in storage in low doses selenium has shown a beneficial effect on plant resistance to various environmental stress factors including drought uv b soil salinity and cold or hot temperatures however it can damage plants at higher doses manganese electrolysis during the electrowinning of manganese the addition of selenium dioxide decreases the power necessary to operate the electrolysis cells china is the largest consumer of selenium dioxide for this purpose for every tonne of manganese an average kg selenium oxide is used glass production the largest commercial use of se accounting for about of consumption is for the production of glass se compounds confer a red color to glass this color cancels out the green or yellow tints that arise from iron impurities typical for most glass for this purpose various selenite and selenate salts are added for other applications a red color may be desired produced by mixtures of cdse and cds alloys selenium is used with bismuth in brasses to replace more toxic lead the regulation of lead in drinking water applications such as in the us with the safe drinking water act of made a reduction of lead in brass necessary the new brass is marketed under the name envirobrass like lead and sulfur selenium improves the machinability of steel at concentrations around selenium produces the same machinability improvement in copper alloys lithium selenium batteries the lithium selenium li se battery is one of the most promising systems for energy storage in the family of lithium batteries the li se battery is an alternative to the lithium sulfur battery with an advantage of high electrical conductivity solar cells selenium was the basis of the very first solar cells with the first example of rooftop solar being a selenium cell from such cells were later used in battery free light meters for photography copper indium gallium selenide is a material used in solar cells photoconductors amorphous selenium se thin films have found application as photoconductors in flat panel x ray detectors these detectors use amorphous selenium to capture and convert incident x ray photons directly into electric charge rectifiers selenium rectifiers were first used in their use continued into the s other uses small amounts of organoselenium compounds have been used to modify the catalysts used for the vulcanization for the production of rubber the demand for selenium by the electronics industry is declining its photovoltaic and photoconductive properties are still useful in photocopying photocells light meters and solar cells its use as a photoconductor in plain paper copiers once was a leading application but in the s the photoconductor application declined although it was still a large end use as more and more copiers switched to organic photoconductors though once widely used selenium rectifiers have mostly been replaced or are being replaced by silicon based devices the most notable exception is in power dc surge protection where the superior energy capabilities of selenium suppressors make them more desirable than metal oxide varistors zinc selenide was the first material for blue leds but gallium nitride dominates that market cadmium selenide was an important component in quantum dots sheets of amorphous selenium convert x ray images to patterns of charge in xeroradiography and in solid state flat panel x ray cameras ionized selenium se is one of the active mediums used in x ray lasers selenium is a catalyst in some chemical reactions but it is not widely used because of issues with toxicity in x ray crystallography incorporation of one or more selenium atoms in place of sulfur helps with multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion and single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing selenium is used in the toning of photographic prints and it is sold as a toner by numerous photographic manufacturers selenium intensifies and extends the tonal range of black and white photographic images and improves the permanence of prints se is used as a gamma source in industrial radiography pollution in high concentrations selenium acts as an environmental contaminant sources of pollution include waste materials from certain mining agricultural petrochemical and industrial manufacturing operations in belews lake north carolina species of fish were eliminated from the lake due to g se l wastewater discharged from to from a duke energy coal fired power plant at the kesterson national wildlife refuge in california thousands of fish and waterbirds were poisoned by selenium in agricultural irrigation drainage substantial physiological changes may occur in fish with high tissue concentrations of selenium fish affected by selenium may experience swelling of the gill lamellae which impedes oxygen diffusion across the gills and blood flow within the gills respiratory capacity is further reduced due to selenium binding to hemoglobin other problems include degeneration of liver tissue swelling around the heart damaged egg follicles in ovaries cataracts and accumulation of fluid in the body cavity and head selenium often causes a malformed fish fetus which may have problems feeding or respiring distortion of the fins or spine is also common adult fish may appear healthy despite their inability to produce viable offspring selenium is bioaccumulated in aquatic habitats which results in higher concentrations in organisms than the surrounding water organoselenium compounds can be concentrated over times by zooplankton when water concentrations are in the to g se l range inorganic selenium bioaccumulates more readily in phytoplankton than zooplankton phytoplankton can concentrate inorganic selenium by a factor of further concentration through bioaccumulation occurs along the food chain as predators consume selenium rich prey it is recommended that a water concentration of g se l be considered highly hazardous to sensitive fish and aquatic birds selenium poisoning can be passed from parents to offspring through the egg and selenium poisoning may persist for many generations reproduction of mallard ducks is impaired at dietary concentrations of g se l many benthic invertebrates can tolerate selenium concentrations up to g l of se in their diet selenium pollution might impact some aquatic systems and may be caused by anthropogenic factors such as farming runoff and industrial processes fish are a major source of protein for humans people who eat more fish are generally healthier than those who eat less indicating selenium pollution does not appear to be a problem although it might be useful to be aware that selenium has a potential effect on humans bioaccumulation of selenium in aquatic environments causes fish kills depending on the species in the affected area there are however a few species that have been seen to survive these events and tolerate the increased selenium it has also been suggested that season could have an impact on the harmful effects of selenium on fish selenium poisoning of water systems may result whenever new agricultural run off courses through dry lands this process leaches natural soluble selenium compounds such as selenates into the water which may then be concentrated in wetlands as the water evaporates selenium pollution of waterways also occurs when selenium is leached from coal flue ash mining and metal smelting crude oil processing and landfill high selenium levels in waterways were found to cause congenital disorders in oviparous species including wetland birds and fish elevated dietary methylmercury levels can amplify the harm of selenium toxicity in oviparous species biological role although it is toxic in large doses selenium is an essential micronutrient for animals in plants it occurs as a bystander mineral sometimes in toxic proportions in forage some plants may accumulate selenium as a defense against being eaten by animals but other plants such as locoweed require selenium and their growth indicates the presence of selenium in soil selenium is a component of the unusual amino acids selenocysteine and selenomethionine in humans selenium is a trace element nutrient that functions as cofactor for reduction of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidases and certain forms of thioredoxin reductase found in animals and some plants this enzyme occurs in all living organisms but not all forms of it in plants require selenium the glutathione peroxidase family of enzymes gsh px catalyze certain reactions that remove reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides gsh h o gsh px gssg h othe thyroid gland and every cell that uses thyroid hormone use selenium which is a cofactor for the three of the four known types of thyroid hormone deiodinases which activate and then deactivate various thyroid hormones and their metabolites the iodothyronine deiodinases are the subfamily of deiodinase enzymes that use selenium as the otherwise rare amino acid selenocysteine only the deiodinase iodotyrosine deiodinase which works on the last breakdown products of thyroid hormone does not use selenium selenium may inhibit hashimoto s disease in which the body s own thyroid cells are attacked as foreign a reduction of on tpo antibodies is reported with the dietary intake of mg of selenium increased dietary selenium reduces the effects of mercury toxicity although it is effective only at low to modest doses of mercury evidence suggests that the molecular mechanisms of mercury toxicity includes the irreversible inhibition of selenoenzymes that are required to prevent and reverse oxidative damage in brain and endocrine tissues an antioxidant selenoneine which is derived from selenium and has been found to be present in the blood of bluefin tuna is the subject of scientific research regarding its possible roles in inflammatory and chronic diseases methylmercury detoxification and oxidative damages it seems as though when mercury levels in a marine fish rise so do the selenium levels to the knowledge of researchers there are no reports of mercury levels exceeding that of selenium levels in ocean fish evolution in biology from about three billion years ago prokaryotic selenoprotein families drive the evolution of selenocysteine an amino acid selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria archaea and eukaryotes as selenocysteine where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells against oxidative damage selenoprotein families of gsh px and the deiodinases of eukaryotic cells seem to have a bacterial phylogenetic origin the selenocysteine containing form occurs in species as diverse as green algae diatoms sea urchins fish and chickens selenium enzymes are involved in the small reducing molecules glutathione and thioredoxin one family of selenium bearing molecules the glutathione peroxidases destroys peroxide and repairs damaged peroxidized cell membranes using glutathione another selenium bearing enzyme in some plants and in animals thioredoxin reductase generates reduced thioredoxin a dithiol that serves as an electron source for peroxidases and also the important reducing enzyme ribonucleotide reductase that makes dna precursors from rna precursors trace elements involved in gsh px and superoxide dismutase enzymes activities i e selenium vanadium magnesium copper and zinc may have been lacking in some terrestrial mineral deficient areas marine organisms retained and sometimes expanded their selenoproteomes whereas the selenoproteomes of some terrestrial organisms were reduced or completely lost these findings suggest that with the exception of vertebrates aquatic life supports selenium use whereas terrestrial habitats lead to reduced use of this trace element marine fishes and vertebrate thyroid glands have the highest concentration of selenium and iodine from about million years ago freshwater and terrestrial plants slowly optimized the production of new endogenous antioxidants such as ascorbic acid vitamin c polyphenols including flavonoids tocopherols etc a few of these appeared more recently in the last million years in fruits and flowers of angiosperm plants in fact the angiosperms the dominant type of plant today and most of their antioxidant pigments evolved during the late jurassic period the deiodinase isoenzymes constitute another family of eukaryotic selenoproteins with identified enzyme function deiodinases are able to extract electrons from iodides and iodides from iodothyronines they are thus involved in thyroid hormone regulation participating in the protection of thyrocytes from damage by h o produced for thyroid hormone biosynthesis about million years ago new selenoproteins were developed as mammalian gsh px enzymes nutritional sources of selenium dietary selenium comes from meat nuts cereals and mushrooms brazil nuts are the richest dietary source though this is soil dependent since the brazil nut does not require high levels of the element for its own needs the us recommended dietary allowance rda of selenium for teenagers and adults is g day selenium as a dietary supplement is available in many forms including multi vitamins mineral supplements which typically contain or g serving selenium specific supplements typically contain either or g serving in june the us food and drug administration fda published its final rule establishing the requirement of minimum and maximum levels of selenium in infant formula the selenium content in the human body is believed to be in the mg range indicator plant species certain species of plants are considered indicators of high selenium content of the soil because they require high levels of selenium to thrive the main selenium indicator plants are astragalus species including some locoweeds prince s plume stanleya sp woody asters xylorhiza sp and false goldenweed oonopsis sp detection in biological fluids selenium may be measured in blood plasma serum or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or investigate a suspected case of fatal overdose some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element both organic and inorganic forms of selenium are largely converted to monosaccharide conjugates selenosugars in the body prior to elimination in the urine cancer patients receiving daily oral doses of selenothionine may achieve very high plasma and urine selenium concentrations toxicity although selenium is an essential trace element it is toxic if taken in excess exceeding the tolerable upper intake level of micrograms per day can lead to selenosis this g tolerable upper intake level is based primarily on a study of five chinese patients who exhibited overt signs of selenosis and a follow up study on the same five people in the study actually found the maximum safe dietary se intake to be approximately micrograms per day micrograms per kilogram body weight but suggested micrograms per day to avoid creating an imbalance of nutrients in the diet and to accord with data from other countries in china people who ingested corn grown in extremely selenium rich stony coal carbonaceous shale have suffered from selenium toxicity this coal was shown to have selenium content as high as the highest concentration in coal ever recorded signs and symptoms of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath gastrointestinal disorders hair loss sloughing of nails fatigue irritability and neurological damage extreme cases of selenosis can exhibit cirrhosis of the liver pulmonary edema or death elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of low bioavailability by contrast selenates and selenites have an oxidant mode of action similar to that of arsenic trioxide and are very toxic the chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about to micrograms of selenium per day hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic corrosive gas selenium also occurs in organic compounds such as dimethyl selenide selenomethionine selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine all of which have high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses on april polo ponies died shortly before a match in the united states polo open three days later a pharmacy

with severely compromised intestinal function those undergoing total parenteral nutrition and in those of advanced age over also people dependent on food grown from selenium deficient soil are at risk although new zealand soil has low levels of selenium adverse health effects have not been detected in the residents selenium deficiency defined by low of normal selenoenzyme activity levels in brain and endocrine tissues occurs only when a low selenium level is linked with an additional stress such as high exposures to mercury or increased oxidant stress from vitamin e deficiency selenium interacts with other nutrients such as iodine and vitamin e the effect of selenium deficiency on health remains uncertain particularly in relation to kashin beck disease also selenium interacts with other minerals such as zinc and copper high doses of se supplements in pregnant animals might disturb the zn cu ratio and lead to zn reduction in such treatment cases zn levels should be monitored further studies are needed to confirm these interactions in the regions e g various regions within north america where low selenium soil levels lead to low concentrations in the plants some animal species may be deficient unless selenium is supplemented with diet or injection ruminants are particularly susceptible in general absorption of dietary selenium is lower in ruminants than other animals and is lower from forages than from grain ruminants grazing certain forages e g some white clover varieties containing cyanogenic glycosides may have higher selenium requirements presumably because cyanide is released from the aglycone by glucosidase activity in the rumen and glutathione peroxidases is deactivated by the cyanide acting on the glutathione moiety neonate ruminants at risk of white muscle disease may be administered both selenium and vitamin e by injection some of the wmd myopathies respond only to selenium some only to vitamin e and some to either health effects the effects of selenium intake on cancer have been studied in several clinical trials and epidemiologic studies in humans selenium may have a chemo preventive role in cancer risk as an anti oxidant and it might trigger the immune response at low levels it is used in the body to create anti oxidant selenoproteins at higher doses than normal it causes cell death selenium in close interrelation with iodine plays a role in thyroid health selenium is a cofactor for the three thyroid hormone deiodinases helping activate and then deactivate various thyroid hormones and their metabolites isolated selenium deficiency is now being investigated for its role in induction autoimmune reactions in thyroid gland in hashimoto s disease however in a case of combined iodine and selenium deficiency

Bromine,Br,bromine is a chemical element with the symbol br and atomic number it is the third lightest element in group of the periodic table halogens and is a volatile red brown liquid at room temperature that evaporates readily to form a similarly coloured vapour its properties are intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine isolated independently by two chemists carl jacob l wig in and antoine j r me balard in its name was derived from the ancient greek bromos meaning stench referring to its sharp and pungent smell elemental bromine is very reactive and thus does not occur as a native element in nature but it occurs in colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts analogous to table salt in fact bromine and all the halogens are so reactive that they form bonds in pairs never in single atoms while it is rather rare in the earth s crust the high solubility of the bromide ion br has caused its accumulation in the oceans commercially the element is easily extracted from brine evaporation ponds mostly in the united states and israel the mass of bromine in the oceans is about one three hundredth that of chlorine at standard conditions for temperature and pressure it is a liquid the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is mercury at high temperatures organobromine compounds readily dissociate to yield free bromine atoms a process that stops free radical chemical chain reactions this effect makes organobromine compounds useful as fire retardants and more than half the bromine produced worldwide each year is put to this purpose the same property causes ultraviolet sunlight to dissociate volatile organobromine compounds in the atmosphere to yield free bromine atoms causing ozone depletion as a result many organobromine compounds such as the pesticide methyl bromide are no longer used bromine compounds are still used in well drilling fluids in photographic film and as an intermediate in the manufacture of organic chemicals large amounts of bromide salts are toxic from the action of soluble bromide ions causing bromism however a clear biological role for bromide ions and hypobromous acid has recently been elucidated and it now appears that bromine is an essential trace element in humans the role of biological organobromine compounds in sea life such as algae has been known for much longer as a pharmaceutical the simple bromide ion br has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system and bromide salts were once a major medical sedative before replacement by shorter acting drugs they retain niche uses as antiepileptics history bromine was discovered independently by two chemists carl jacob l wig and antoine balard in and respectively l wig isolated bromine from a mineral water spring from his hometown bad kreuznach in l wig used a solution of the mineral salt saturated with chlorine and extracted the bromine with diethyl ether after evaporation of the ether a brown liquid remained with this liquid as a sample of his work he applied for a position in the laboratory of leopold gmelin in heidelberg the publication of the results was delayed and balard published his results first balard found bromine chemicals in the ash of seaweed from the salt marshes of montpellier the seaweed was used to produce iodine but also contained bromine balard distilled the bromine from a solution of seaweed ash saturated with chlorine the properties of the resulting substance were intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine thus he tried to prove that the substance was iodine monochloride icl but after failing to do so he was sure that he had found a new element and named it muride derived from the latin word muria brine after the french chemists louis nicolas vauquelin louis jacques th nard and joseph louis gay lussac approved the experiments of the young pharmacist balard the results were presented at a lecture of the acad mie des sciences and published in annales de chimie et physique in his publication balard stated that he changed the name from muride to br me on the proposal of m anglada the name br me bromine derives from the greek br mos stench other sources claim that the french chemist and physicist joseph louis gay lussac suggested the name br me for the characteristic smell of the vapors bromine was not produced in large quantities until when the discovery of salt deposits in stassfurt enabled its production as a by product of potash apart from some minor medical applications the first commercial use was the daguerreotype in bromine was discovered to have some advantages over the previously used iodine vapor to create the light sensitive silver halide layer in daguerreotypy potassium bromide and sodium bromide were used as anticonvulsants and sedatives in the late th and early th centuries but were gradually superseded by chloral hydrate and then by the barbiturates in the early years of the first world war bromine compounds such as xylyl bromide were used as poison gas properties bromine is the third halogen being a nonmetal in group of the periodic table its properties are thus similar to those of fluorine chlorine and iodine and tend to be intermediate between those of the two neighbouring halogens chlorine and iodine bromine has the electron configuration ar s d p with the seven electrons in the fourth and outermost shell acting as its valence electrons like all halogens it is thus one electron short of a full octet and is hence a strong oxidising agent reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell corresponding to periodic trends it is intermediate in electronegativity between chlorine and iodine f cl br i and is less reactive than chlorine and more reactive than iodine it is also a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine but a stronger one than iodine conversely the bromide ion is a weaker reducing agent than iodide but a stronger one than chloride these similarities led to chlorine bromine and iodine together being classified as one of the original triads of johann wolfgang d bereiner whose work foreshadowed the periodic law for chemical elements it is intermediate in atomic radius between chlorine and iodine and this leads to many of its atomic properties being similarly intermediate in value between chlorine and iodine such as first ionisation energy electron affinity enthalpy of dissociation of the x molecule x cl br i ionic radius and x x bond length the volatility of bromine accentuates its very penetrating choking and unpleasant odour all four stable halogens experience intermolecular van der waals forces of attraction and their strength increases together with the number of electrons among all homonuclear diatomic halogen molecules thus the melting and boiling points of bromine are intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine as a result of the increasing molecular weight of the halogens down the group the density and heats of fusion and vaporisation of bromine are again intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine although all their heats of vaporisation are fairly low leading to high volatility thanks to their diatomic molecular structure the halogens darken in colour as the group is descended fluorine is a very pale yellow gas chlorine is greenish yellow and bromine is a reddish brown volatile liquid that melts at c and boils at c iodine is a shiny black solid this trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group specifically the colour of a halogen such as bromine results from the electron transition between the highest occupied antibonding g molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding u molecular orbital the colour fades at low temperatures so that solid bromine at c is pale yellow like solid chlorine and iodine solid bromine crystallises in the orthorhombic crystal system in a layered arrangement of br molecules the br br distance is pm close to the gaseous br br distance of pm and the br br distance between molecules is pm within a layer and pm between layers compare the van der waals radius of bromine pm this structure means that bromine is a very poor conductor of electricity with a conductivity of around cm just below the melting point although this is higher than the essentially undetectable conductivity of chlorine at a pressure of gpa roughly times atmospheric pressure bromine undergoes an insulator to metal transition at gpa it changes to a face centered orthorhombic structure at gpa it changes to a body centered orthorhombic monatomic form isotopes bromine has two stable isotopes br and br these are its only two natural isotopes with br making up of natural bromine and br making up the remaining both have nuclear spin and thus may be used for nuclear magnetic resonance although br is more favourable the relatively distribution of the two isotopes in nature is helpful in identification of bromine containing compounds using mass spectroscopy other bromine isotopes are all radioactive with half lives too short to occur in nature of these the most important are br t min mbr t h and br t h which may be produced from the neutron activation of natural bromine the most stable bromine radioisotope is br t h the primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than br is electron capture to isotopes of selenium that of isotopes heavier than br is beta decay to isotopes of krypton and br may decay by either mode to stable se or kr chemistry and compounds bromine is intermediate in reactivity between chlorine and iodine and is one of the most reactive elements bond energies to bromine tend to be lower than those to chlorine but higher than those to iodine and bromine is a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine but a stronger one than iodine this can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the x x couples f v cl v br v i v at approximately v bromination often leads to higher oxidation states than iodination but lower or equal oxidation states to chlorination bromine tends to react with compounds including m m m h or m c bonds to form m br bonds hydrogen bromide the simplest compound of bromine is hydrogen bromide hbr it is mainly used in the production of inorganic bromides and alkyl bromides and as a catalyst for many reactions in organic chemistry industrially it is mainly produced by the reaction of hydrogen gas with bromine gas at c with a platinum catalyst however reduction of bromine with red phosphorus is a more practical way to produce hydrogen bromide in the laboratory p h o br hbr h po h po h o br hbr h po at room temperature hydrogen bromide is a colourless gas like all the hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative bromine atom however weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline hydrogen bromide at low temperatures similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised aqueous hydrogen bromide is known as hydrobromic acid which is a strong acid pka because the hydrogen bonds to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation the hbr h o system also involves many hydrates hbr nh o for n and which are essentially salts of bromine anions and hydronium cations hydrobromic acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point c at g hbr per g solution thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation unlike hydrogen fluoride anhydrous liquid hydrogen bromide is difficult to work with as a solvent because its boiling point is low it has a small liquid range its dielectric constant is low and it does not dissociate appreciably into h br and hbr ions the latter in any case are much less stable than the bifluoride ions hf due to the very weak hydrogen bonding between hydrogen and bromine though its salts with very large and weakly polarising cations such as cs and nr r me et bun may still be isolated anhydrous hydrogen bromide is a poor solvent only able to dissolve small molecular compounds such as nitrosyl chloride and phenol or salts with very low lattice energies such as tetraalkylammonium halides other binary bromides nearly all elements in the periodic table form binary bromides the exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions the noble gases with the exception of xenon in the very unstable xebr extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation many of the heaviest elements beyond bismuth and having an electronegativity higher than bromine s oxygen nitrogen fluorine and chlorine so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not bromides but rather oxides nitrides fluorides or chlorides of bromine nonetheless nitrogen tribromide is named as a bromide as it is analogous to the other nitrogen trihalides bromination of metals with br tends to yield lower oxidation states than chlorination with cl when a variety of oxidation states is available bromides can be made by reaction of an element or its oxide hydroxide or carbonate with hydrobromic acid and then dehydrated by mildly high temperatures combined with either low pressure or anhydrous hydrogen bromide gas these methods work best when the bromide product is stable to hydrolysis otherwise the possibilities include high temperature oxidative bromination of the element with bromine or hydrogen bromide high temperature bromination of a metal oxide or other halide by bromine a volatile metal bromide carbon tetrabromide or an organic bromide for example niobium v oxide reacts with carbon tetrabromide at c to form niobium v bromide another method is halogen exchange in the presence of excess halogenating reagent for example fecl bbr excess febr bcl when a lower bromide is wanted either a higher halide may be reduced using hydrogen or a metal as a reducing agent or thermal decomposition or disproportionation may be used as follows wbr al thermal gradient c c wbr albr eubr h eubr hbr tabr c tabr tabr most metal bromides with the metal in low oxidation states to are ionic nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular bromides as do metals in high oxidation states from and above both ionic and covalent bromides are known for metals in oxidation state e g scandium bromide is mostly ionic but aluminium bromide is not silver bromide is very insoluble in water and is thus often used as a qualitative test for bromine bromine halides the halogens form many binary diamagnetic interhalogen compounds with stoichiometries xy xy xy and xy where x is heavier than y and bromine is no exception bromine forms a monofluoride and monochloride as well as a trifluoride and pentafluoride some cationic and anionic derivatives are also characterised such as brf brcl brf brf and brf apart from these some pseudohalides are also known such as cyanogen bromide brcn bromine thiocyanate brscn and bromine azide brn the pale brown bromine monofluoride brf is unstable at room temperature disproportionating quickly and irreversibly into bromine bromine trifluoride and bromine pentafluoride it thus cannot be obtained pure it may be synthesised by the direct reaction of the elements or by the comproportionation of bromine and bromine trifluoride at high temperatures bromine monochloride brcl a red brown gas quite readily dissociates reversibly into bromine and chlorine at room temperature and thus also cannot be obtained pure though it can be made by the reversible direct reaction of its elements in the gas phase or in carbon tetrachloride bromine monofluoride in ethanol readily leads to the monobromination of the aromatic compounds phx para bromination occurs for x me but ome br meta bromination occurs for the deactivating x co et cho no this is due to heterolytic fission of the br f bond leading to rapid electrophilic bromination by br at room temperature bromine trifluoride brf is a straw coloured liquid it may be formed by directly fluorinating bromine at room temperature and is purified through distillation it reacts violently with water and explodes on contact with flammable materials but is a less powerful fluorinating reagent than chlorine trifluoride it reacts vigorously with boron carbon silicon arsenic antimony iodine and sulfur to give fluorides and will also convert most metals and many metal compounds to fluorides as such it is used to oxidise uranium to uranium hexafluoride in the nuclear power industry refractory oxides tend to be only partially fluorinated but here the derivatives kbrf and brf sbf remain reactive bromine trifluoride is a useful nonaqueous ionising solvent since it readily dissociates to form brf and brf and thus conducts electricity bromine pentafluoride brf was first synthesised in it is produced on a large scale by direct reaction of bromine with excess fluorine at temperatures higher than c and on a small scale by the fluorination of potassium bromide at c it also reacts violently with water and is a very strong fluorinating agent although chlorine trifluoride is still stronger polybromine compounds although dibromine is a strong oxidising agent with a high first ionisation energy very strong oxidisers such as peroxydisulfuryl fluoride s o f can oxidise it to form the cherry red br cation a few other bromine cations are known namely the brown br and dark brown br the tribromide anion br has also been characterised it is analogous to triiodide bromine oxides and oxoacids bromine oxides are not as well characterised as chlorine oxides or iodine oxides as they are all fairly unstable it was once thought that they could not exist at all dibromine monoxide is a dark brown solid which while reasonably stable at c decomposes at its melting point of c it is useful in bromination reactions and may be made from the low temperature decomposition of bromine dioxide in a vacuum it oxidises iodine to iodine pentoxide and benzene to benzoquinone in alkaline solutions it gives the hypobromite anion so called bromine dioxide a pale yellow crystalline solid may be better formulated as bromine perbromate brobro it is thermally unstable above c violently decomposing to its elements at c dibromine trioxide syn brobro is also known it is the anhydride of hypobromous acid and bromic acid it is an orange crystalline solid which decomposes above c if heated too rapidly it explodes around c a few other unstable radical oxides are also known as are some poorly characterised oxides such as dibromine pentoxide tribromine octoxide and bromine trioxide the four oxoacids hypobromous acid hobr bromous acid hobro bromic acid hobro and perbromic acid hobro are better studied due to their greater stability though they are only so in aqueous solution when bromine dissolves in aqueous solution the following reactions occur hypobromous acid is unstable to disproportionation the hypobromite ions thus formed disproportionate readily to give bromide and bromate bromous acids and bromites are very unstable although the strontium and barium bromites are known more important are the bromates which are prepared on a small scale by oxidation of bromide by aqueous hypochlorite and are strong oxidising agents unlike chlorates which very slowly disproportionate to chloride and perchlorate the bromate anion is stable to disproportionation in both acidic and aqueous solutions bromic acid is a strong acid bromides and bromates may comproportionate to bromine as follows bro br h br h othere were many failed attempts to obtain perbromates and perbromic acid leading to some rationalisations as to why they should not exist until when the anion was first synthesised from the radioactive beta decay of unstable seo today perbromates are produced by the oxidation of alkaline bromate solutions by fluorine gas excess bromate and fluoride are precipitated as silver bromate and calcium fluoride and the perbromic acid solution may be purified the perbromate ion is fairly inert at room temperature but is thermodynamically extremely oxidising with extremely strong oxidising agents needed to produce it such as fluorine or xenon difluoride the br o bond in bro is fairly weak which corresponds to the general reluctance of the p elements arsenic selenium and bromine to attain their group oxidation state as they come after the scandide contraction characterised by the poor shielding afforded by the radial nodeless d orbitals organobromine compounds like the other carbon halogen bonds the c br bond is a common functional group that forms part of core organic chemistry formally compounds with this functional group may be considered organic derivatives of the bromide anion due to the difference of electronegativity between bromine and carbon the carbon atom in a c br bond is electron deficient and thus electrophilic the reactivity of organobromine compounds resembles but is intermediate between the reactivity of organochlorine and organoiodine compounds for many applications organobromides represent a compromise of reactivity and cost organobromides are typically produced by additive or substitutive bromination of other organic precursors bromine itself can be used but due to its toxicity and volatility safer brominating reagents are normally used such as n bromosuccinimide the principal reactions for organobromides include dehydrobromination grignard reactions reductive coupling and nucleophilic substitution organobromides are the most common organohalides in nature even though the concentration of bromide is only of that for chloride in sea water because of the easy oxidation of bromide to the equivalent of br a potent electrophile the enzyme bromoperoxidase catalyzes this reaction the oceans are estimated to release million tons of bromoform and tons of bromomethane annually an old qualitative test for the presence of the alkene functional group is that alkenes turn brown aqueous bromine solutions colourless forming a bromohydrin with some of the dibromoalkane also produced the reaction passes through a short lived strongly electrophilic bromonium intermediate this is an example of a halogen addition reaction occurrence and production bromine is significantly less abundant in the crust than fluorine or chlorine comprising only parts per million of the earth s crustal rocks and then only as bromide salts it is the forty sixth most abundant element in earth s crust it is significantly more abundant in the oceans resulting from long term leaching there it makes up parts per million corresponding to a ratio of about one bromine atom for every chlorine atoms salt lakes and brine wells may have higher bromine concentrations for example the dead sea contains bromide ions it is from these sources that bromine extraction is mostly economically feasible the main sources of bromine are in the united states and israel the element is liberated by halogen exchange using chlorine gas to oxidise br to br this is then removed with a blast of steam or air and is then condensed and purified today bromine is transported in large capacity metal drums or lead lined tanks that can hold hundreds of kilograms or even tonnes of bromine the bromine industry is about one hundredth the size of the chlorine industry laboratory production is unnecessary because bromine is commercially available and has a long shelf life applications a wide variety of organobromine compounds are used in industry some are prepared from bromine and others are prepared from hydrogen bromide which is obtained by burning hydrogen in bromine flame retardants brominated flame retardants represent a commodity of growing importance and make up the largest commercial use of bromine when the brominated material burns the flame retardant produces hydrobromic acid which interferes in the radical chain reaction of the oxidation reaction of the fire the mechanism is that the highly reactive hydrogen radicals oxygen radicals and hydroxy radicals react with hydrobromic acid to form less reactive bromine radicals i e free bromine atoms bromine atoms may also react directly with other radicals to help terminate the free radical chain reactions that characterise combustion to make brominated polymers and plastics bromine containing compounds can be incorporated into the polymer during polymerisation one method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process for example vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process for example tetrabromobisphenol a can be added to polyesters or epoxy resins where it becomes part of the polymer epoxies used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins indicated by the fr in the abbreviation of the products fr and fr in some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation for example decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers a number of gaseous or highly volatile brominated halomethane compounds are non toxic and make superior fire suppressant agents by this same mechanism and are particularly effective in enclosed spaces such as submarines airplanes and spacecraft however they are expensive and their production and use has been greatly curtailed due to their effect as ozone depleting agents they are no longer used in routine fire extinguishers but retain niche uses in aerospace and military automatic fire suppression applications they include bromochloromethane halon ch brcl bromochlorodifluoromethane halon cbrclf and bromotrifluoromethane halon cbrf other uses silver bromide is used either alone or in combination with silver chloride and silver iodide as the light sensitive constituent of photographic emulsions ethylene bromide was an additive in gasolines containing lead anti engine knocking agents it scavenges lead by forming volatile lead bromide which is exhausted from the engine this application accounted for of the bromine use in in the us this application has declined since the s due to environmental regulations see below brominated vegetable oil bvo a complex mixture of plant derived triglycerides that have been reacted to contain atoms of the element bromine bonded to the molecules is used primarily to help emulsify citrus flavored soft drinks preventing them from separating during distribution poisonous bromomethane was widely used as pesticide to fumigate soil and to fumigate housing by the tenting method ethylene bromide was similarly used these volatile organobromine compounds are all now regulated as ozone depletion agents the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer scheduled the phase out for the ozone depleting chemical by and organobromide pesticides are no longer used in housing fumigation they have been replaced by such compounds as sulfuryl fluoride which contain neither the chlorine or bromine organics which harm ozone before the montreal protocol in for example an estimated tonnes of the chemical were used to control nematodes fungi weeds and other soil borne diseases in pharmacology inorganic bromide compounds especially potassium bromide were frequently used as general sedatives in the th and early th century bromides in the form of simple salts are still used as anticonvulsants in both veterinary and human medicine although the latter use varies from country to country for example the u s food and drug administration fda does not approve bromide for the treatment of any disease and it was removed from over the counter sedative products like bromo seltzer in commercially available organobromine pharmaceuticals include the vasodilator nicergoline the sedative brotizolam the anticancer agent pipobroman and the antiseptic merbromin otherwise organobromine compounds are rarely pharmaceutically useful in contrast to the situation for organofluorine compounds several drugs are produced as the bromide or equivalents hydrobromide salts but in such cases bromide serves as an innocuous counterion of no biological significance other uses of organobromine compounds include high density drilling fluids dyes such as tyrian purple and the indicator bromothymol blue and pharmaceuticals bromine itself as well as some of its compounds are used in water treatment and is the precursor of a variety of inorganic compounds with an enormous number of applications e g silver bromide for photography zinc bromine batteries are hybrid flow batteries used for stationary electrical power backup and storage from household scale to industrial scale bromine is used in cooling towers in place of chlorine for controlling bacteria algae fungi and zebra mussels because it has similar antiseptic qualities to chlorine bromine can be used in the same manner as chlorine as a disinfectant or antimicrobial in applications such as swimming pools however bromine is usually not used outside for these applications due to it being relatively more expensive than chlorine and the absence of a stabilizer to protect it from the sun for indoor pools it can be a good option as it is effective at a wider ph range it is also more stable in a heated pool or hot tub biological role and toxicity a study suggests that bromine in the form of bromide ion is a necessary cofactor in the biosynthesis of collagen iv making the element essential to basement membrane architecture and tissue development in animals nevertheless no clear deprivation symptoms or syndromes have been documented in other biological functions bromine may be non essential but still beneficial when it takes the place of chlorine for example in the presence of hydrogen peroxide h o formed by the eosinophil and either chloride or bromide ions eosinophil peroxidase provides a potent mechanism by which eosinophils kill multicellular parasites such as for example the nematode worms involved in filariasis and some bacteria such as tuberculosis bacteria eosinophil peroxidase is a haloperoxidase that preferentially uses bromide over chloride for this purpose generating hypobromite hypobromous acid although the use of chloride is possible haloesters are generally thought of as highly reactive and consequently toxic intermediates in organic synthesis nevertheless mammals including humans cats and rats appear to biosynthesize traces of an bromoester octyl bromo oxobutanoate which is found in their cerebrospinal fluid and appears to play a yet unclarified role in inducing rem sleep neutrophil myeloperoxidase can use h o and br to brominate deoxycytidine which could result in dna mutations marine organisms are the main source of organobromine compounds and it is in these organisms that bromine is more firmly shown to be essential more than such organobromine compounds were identified by the most abundant is methyl bromide ch br of which an estimated tonnes is produced by marine algae each year the essential oil of the hawaiian alga asparagopsis taxiformis consists of bromoform most of such organobromine compounds in the sea are made by the action of a unique algal enzyme vanadium bromoperoxidase the bromide anion is not very toxic a normal daily intake is to milligrams however high levels of bromide chronically impair the membrane of neurons which progressively impairs neuronal transmission leading to toxicity known as bromism bromide has an elimination half life of to days which can lead to excessive accumulation doses of to gram per day of bromide can lead to bromism historically the therapeutic dose of bromide is about to grams of bromide thus explaining why chronic toxicity bromism was once so common while significant and sometimes serious disturbances occur to neurologic psychiatric dermatological and gastrointestinal functions death from bromism is rare bromism is caused by a neurotoxic effect on the brain which results in somnolence psychosis seizures and delirium elemental bromine is toxic and causes chemical burns on human flesh inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract causing coughing choking shortness of breath and death if inhaled in large enough amounts chronic exposure may lead to frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health as a strong oxidising agent bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds caution is required when transporting bromine it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead supported by strong metal frames the occupational safety and health administration osha of the united states has set a permissible exposure limit pel for bromine at a time weighted average twa of ppm the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit rel of twa ppm and a short term limit of ppm the exposure to bromine immediately dangerous to life and health idlh is ppm bromine is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the united states as defined in section of the u s emergency

amounts in the atmosphere and is often used with other rare gases in fluorescent lamps with rare exceptions krypton is chemically inert krypton like the other noble gases is used in lighting and photography krypton light has many spectral lines and krypton plasma is useful in bright high powered gas lasers krypton ion and excimer lasers each of which resonates and amplifies a single spectral line krypton fluoride also makes a useful laser medium from to the official definition of meter was based on the wavelength of one spectral line of krypton because of the high power and relative ease of operation of krypton discharge tubes history krypton was discovered in britain in by william ramsay a scottish chemist and morris travers an english chemist in residue left from evaporating nearly all components of liquid air neon was discovered by a similar procedure by the same workers just a few weeks later william ramsay was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry for discovery of a series of noble gases including krypton in the international bureau of weights and measures defined the meter as wavelengths of light emitted in the vacuum corresponding to the transition between the levels p and d of krypton isotope this agreement replaced the international prototype meter which was a metal bar located in s vres this also obsoleted the definition of the ngstr m based on the red cadmium spectral line replacing it with m the krypton definition lasted until the october conference which redefined the meter as the distance that light travels in vacuum during s characteristics krypton is characterized by several sharp emission lines spectral signatures the strongest being green and yellow krypton is one of the products of uranium fission solid krypton is white and has a face centered cubic crystal structure which is a common property of all noble gases except helium which has a hexagonal close packed crystal structure isotopes naturally occurring krypton in earth s atmosphere is composed of five stable isotopes plus one isotope kr with such a long half life years that it can be considered stable this isotope has the second longest known half life among all isotopes for which decay has been observed it undergoes double electron capture to se in addition about thirty unstable isotopes and isomers are known traces of kr a cosmogenic nuclide produced by the cosmic ray irradiation of kr also occur in nature this isotope is radioactive with a half life of years krypton is highly volatile and does not stay in solution in near surface water but kr has been used for dating old years groundwater kr is an inert radioactive noble gas with a half life of years it is produced by the fission of uranium and plutonium such as in nuclear bomb testing and nuclear reactors kr is released during the reprocessing of fuel rods from nuclear reactors concentrations at the north pole are higher than at the south pole due to convective mixing oxidation states krypton is usually found in the oxidation state typical of noble gases however krypton can form in the and although this is rarely found as oxidation states cannot form compounds krypton s compounds such as krf are usually found in the oxidation state chemistry like the other noble gases krypton is chemically highly unreactive the rather restricted chemistry of krypton in the oxidation state parallels that of the neighboring element bromine in the oxidation state due to the scandide contraction it is difficult to oxidize the p elements to their group oxidation states until the s no noble gas compounds had been synthesized following the first successful synthesis of xenon compounds in synthesis of krypton difluoride krf was reported in in the same year krf was reported by grosse et al but was subsequently shown to be a mistaken identification under extreme conditions krypton reacts with fluorine to form krf according to the following equation kr f krf displaystyle ce kr f krf krypton gas in a krypton fluoride laser absorbs energy from a source causing the krypton to react with fluorine gas producing the exciplex krypton fluoride a temporary complex in an excited energy state kr f krf displaystyle ce kr f krf the complex can undergo spontaneous or stimulated emission reducing its energy state to a metastable but highly repulsive ground state the ground state complex quickly dissociates into unbound atoms krf kr f displaystyle ce krf kr f the result is an exciplex laser which radiates energy at nm near the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum corresponding with the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state of the complex compounds with krypton bonded to atoms other than fluorine have also been discovered there are also unverified reports of a barium salt of a krypton oxoacid arkr and krh polyatomic ions have been investigated and there is evidence for krxe or krxe the reaction of krf with b otef produces an unstable compound kr otef that contains a krypton oxygen bond a krypton nitrogen bond is found in the cation hc n kr f produced by the reaction of krf with hc nh asf below c hkrcn and hkrc ch krypton hydride cyanide and hydrokryptoacetylene were reported to be stable up to k krypton hydride kr h crystals can be grown at pressures above gpa they have a face centered cubic structure where krypton octahedra are surrounded by randomly oriented hydrogen molecules natural occurrence earth has retained all of the noble gases that were present at its formation except helium krypton s concentration in the atmosphere is about ppm it can be extracted from liquid air by fractional distillation the amount of krypton in space is uncertain because measurement is derived from meteoric activity and solar winds the first measurements suggest an abundance of krypton in space applications krypton s multiple emission lines make ionized krypton gas discharges appear whitish which in turn makes krypton based bulbs useful in photography as a white light source krypton is used in some photographic flashes for high speed photography krypton gas is also combined with mercury to make luminous signs that glow with a bright greenish blue light krypton is mixed with argon in energy efficient fluorescent lamps reducing the power consumption but also reducing the light output and raising the cost krypton costs about times as much as argon krypton along with xenon is also used to fill incandescent lamps to reduce filament evaporation and allow higher operating temperatures a brighter light results with more blue color than conventional incandescent lamps krypton s white discharge is sometimes used as an artistic effect in gas discharge neon tubes krypton produces much higher light power than neon in the red spectral line region and for this reason red lasers for high power laser light shows are often krypton lasers with mirrors that select the red spectral line for laser amplification and emission rather than the more familiar helium neon variety which could not achieve the same multi watt outputs the krypton fluoride laser is important in nuclear fusion energy research in confinement experiments the laser has high beam uniformity short wavelength and the spot size can be varied to track an imploding pellet in experimental particle physics liquid krypton is used to construct quasi homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeters a notable example is the calorimeter of the na experiment at cern containing about tonnes of liquid krypton this usage is rare since liquid argon is less expensive the advantage of krypton is a smaller moli re radius of cm which provides excellent spatial resolution with little overlapping the other parameters relevant for calorimetry are radiation length of x cm and density of g cm the sealed spark gap assemblies in ignition exciters in some older jet engines contain a small amount of krypton to produce consistent ionization levels and uniform operation krypton has application in magnetic resonance imaging mri for imaging airways in particular it enables the radiologist to distinguish between hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces containing an airway although xenon has potential for use in computed tomography ct to assess regional ventilation its anesthetic properties limit its fraction in the breathing gas to a breathing mixture of xenon and krypton is comparable in effectiveness for ct to a xenon fraction while avoiding the unwanted effects of a high partial pressure of xenon gas the metastable isotope krypton m is used in nuclear medicine for lung ventilation perfusion scans where it is inhaled and imaged with a gamma camera krypton in the atmosphere has been used to detect clandestine nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities in north korea and pakistan those facilities were detected in the early s and were believed to be producing weapons grade plutonium krypton is a medium lived fission product and thus escapes from spent fuel when the cladding is removed this release is usually not dangerous as krypton is chemically inert and disperses widely in the atmosphere but it can be detected by sufficiently sensitive equipment krypton is used occasionally as an insulating gas between window panes spacex starlink use krypton as propellant for their electric propulsion system precautions krypton is considered to be a non toxic asphyxiant being lipophilic krypton has a significant anaestethic effect although the mechanism of this phenomenon is still not fully clear there s good evidence that the two properties are mechanistically related with narcotic potency seven times greater than air and breathing an atmosphere of krypton and natural air as might happen in the locality of a leak causes narcosis in humans similar to breathing air at four times atmospheric pressure this is comparable to scuba diving at a depth of m ft and could affect anyone breathing it at the same time that mixture would contain only oxygen rather than the normal and hypoxia would be a greater concern ,36
Rubidium,Rb,rubidium is the chemical element with the symbol rb and atomic number it is a very soft whitish grey solid in the alkali metal group similar to potassium and caesium rubidium is the first alkali metal in the group to have a density higher than water on earth natural rubidium comprises two isotopes is a stable isotope rb and is slightly radioactive rb with a half life of billion years more than three times as long as the estimated age of the universe german chemists robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff discovered rubidium in by the newly developed technique flame spectroscopy the name comes from the latin word rubidus meaning deep red the color of its emission spectrum rubidium s compounds have various chemical and electronic applications rubidium metal is easily vaporized and has a convenient spectral absorption range making it a frequent target for laser manipulation of atoms rubidium is not a known nutrient for any living organisms however rubidium ions have similar properties and the same charge as potassium ions and are actively taken up and treated by animal cells in similar ways characteristics rubidium is a very soft ductile silvery white metal it is the second most electropositive of the stable alkali metals and melts at a temperature of c f like other alkali metals rubidium metal reacts violently with water as with potassium which is slightly less reactive and caesium which is slightly more reactive this reaction is usually vigorous enough to ignite the hydrogen gas it produces rubidium has also been reported to ignite spontaneously in air it forms amalgams with mercury and alloys with gold iron caesium sodium and potassium but not lithium even though rubidium and lithium are in the same group rubidium has a very low ionization energy of only kj mol rubidium and potassium show a very similar purple color in the flame test and distinguishing the two elements requires more sophisticated analysis such as spectroscopy compounds rubidium chloride rbcl is probably the most used rubidium compound among several other chlorides it is used to induce living cells to take up dna it is also used as a biomarker because in nature it is found only in small quantities in living organisms and when present replaces potassium other common rubidium compounds are the corrosive rubidium hydroxide rboh the starting material for most rubidium based chemical processes rubidium carbonate rb co used in some optical glasses and rubidium copper sulfate rb so cuso h o rubidium silver iodide rbag i has the highest room temperature conductivity of any known ionic crystal a property exploited in thin film batteries and other applications rubidium forms a number of oxides when exposed to air including rubidium monoxide rb o rb o and rb o rubidium in excess oxygen gives the superoxide rbo rubidium forms salts with halogens producing rubidium fluoride rubidium chloride rubidium bromide and rubidium iodide isotopes although rubidium is monoisotopic rubidium in the earth s crust is composed of two isotopes the stable rb and the radioactive rb natural rubidium is radioactive with specific activity of about bq g enough to significantly expose a photographic film in days thirty additional rubidium isotopes have been synthesized with half lives of less than months most are highly radioactive and have few uses rubidium has a half life of years which is more than three times the age of the universe of years making it a primordial nuclide it readily substitutes for potassium in minerals and is therefore fairly widespread rb has been used extensively in dating rocks rb beta decays to stable sr during fractional crystallization sr tends to concentrate in plagioclase leaving rb in the liquid phase hence the rb sr ratio in residual magma may increase over time and the progressing differentiation results in rocks with elevated rb sr ratios the highest ratios or more occur in pegmatites if the initial amount of sr is known or can be extrapolated then the age can be determined by measurement of the rb and sr concentrations and of the sr sr ratio the dates indicate the true age of the minerals only if the rocks have not been subsequently altered see rubidium strontium dating rubidium one of the element s non natural isotopes is produced by electron capture decay of strontium with a half life of days with a half life of seconds rubidium decays by positron emission to stable krypton occurrence rubidium is the twenty third most abundant element in the earth s crust roughly as abundant as zinc and rather more common than copper it occurs naturally in the minerals leucite pollucite carnallite and zinnwaldite which contain as much as rubidium oxide lepidolite contains between and rubidium and is the commercial source of the element some potassium minerals and potassium chlorides also contain the element in commercially significant quantities seawater contains an average of g l of rubidium compared to the much higher value for potassium of mg l and the much lower value of g l for caesium rubidium is the th most abundant element in seawater because of its large ionic radius rubidium is one of the incompatible elements during magma crystallization rubidium is concentrated together with its heavier analogue caesium in the liquid phase and crystallizes last therefore the largest deposits of rubidium and caesium are zone pegmatite ore bodies formed by this enrichment process because rubidium substitutes for potassium in the crystallization of magma the enrichment is far less effective than that of caesium zone pegmatite ore bodies containing mineable quantities of caesium as pollucite or the lithium minerals lepidolite are also a source for rubidium as a by product two notable sources of rubidium are the rich deposits of pollucite at bernic lake manitoba canada and the rubicline rb k alsi o found as impurities in pollucite on the italian island of elba with a rubidium content of both of those deposits are also sources of caesium production although rubidium is more abundant in earth s crust than caesium the limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to to tonnes per year several methods are available for separating potassium rubidium and caesium the fractional crystallization of a rubidium and caesium alum cs rb al so h o yields after subsequent steps pure rubidium alum two other methods are reported the chlorostannate process and the ferrocyanide process for several years in the s and s a by product of potassium production called alkarb was a main source for rubidium alkarb contained rubidium with the rest being potassium and a small amount of caesium today the largest producers of caesium produce rubidium as a by product from pollucite history rubidium was discovered in by robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff in heidelberg germany in the mineral lepidolite through flame spectroscopy because of the bright red lines in its emission spectrum they chose a name derived from the latin word rubidus meaning deep red rubidium is a minor component in lepidolite kirchhoff and bunsen processed kg of a lepidolite containing only rubidium monoxide rb o both potassium and rubidium form insoluble salts with chloroplatinic acid but those salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water therefore the less soluble rubidium hexachloroplatinate rb ptcl could be obtained by fractional crystallization after reduction of the hexachloroplatinate with hydrogen the process yielded grams of rubidium chloride rbcl for further studies bunsen and kirchhoff began their first large scale isolation of caesium and rubidium compounds with litres us gal of mineral water which yielded grams of caesium chloride and grams of rubidium chloride rubidium was the second element shortly after caesium to be discovered by spectroscopy just one year after the invention of the spectroscope by bunsen and kirchhoff the two scientists used the rubidium chloride to estimate that the atomic weight of the new element was the currently accepted value is they tried to generate elemental rubidium by electrolysis of molten rubidium chloride but instead of a metal they obtained a blue homogeneous substance which neither under the naked eye nor under the microscope showed the slightest trace of metallic substance they presumed that it was a subchloride rb cl however the product was probably a colloidal mixture of the metal and rubidium chloride in a second attempt to produce metallic rubidium bunsen was able to reduce rubidium by heating charred rubidium tartrate although the distilled rubidium was pyrophoric they were able to determine the density and the melting point the quality of this research in the s can be appraised by the fact that their determined density differs by less than g cm and the melting point by less than c from the presently accepted values the slight radioactivity of rubidium was discovered in but that was before the theory of isotopes was established in and the low level of activity half life greater than years made interpretation complicated the now proven decay of rb to stable sr through beta decay was still under discussion in the late s rubidium had minimal industrial value before the s since then the most important use of rubidium is research and development primarily in chemical and electronic applications in rubidium was used to produce a bose einstein condensate for which the discoverers eric allin cornell carl edwin wieman and wolfgang ketterle won the nobel prize in physics applications rubidium compounds are sometimes used in fireworks to give them a purple color rubidium has also been considered for use in a thermoelectric generator using the magnetohydrodynamic principle whereby hot rubidium ions are passed through a magnetic field these conduct electricity and act like an armature of a generator thereby generating an electric current rubidium particularly vaporized rb is one of the most commonly used atomic species employed for laser cooling and bose einstein condensation its desirable features for this application include the ready availability of inexpensive diode laser light at the relevant wavelength and the moderate temperatures required to obtain substantial vapor pressures for cold atom applications requiring tunable interactions rb is preferred for its rich feshbach spectrum rubidium has been used for polarizing he producing volumes of magnetized he gas with the nuclear spins aligned rather than random rubidium vapor is optically pumped by a laser and the polarized rb polarizes he through the hyperfine interaction such spin polarized he cells are useful for neutron polarization measurements and for producing polarized neutron beams for other purposes the resonant element in atomic clocks utilizes the hyperfine structure of rubidium s energy levels and rubidium is useful for high precision timing it is used as the main component of secondary frequency references rubidium oscillators in cell site transmitters and other electronic transmitting networking and test equipment these rubidium standards are often used with gps to produce a primary frequency standard that has greater accuracy and is less expensive than caesium standards such rubidium standards are often mass produced for the telecommunication industry other potential or current uses of rubidium include a working fluid in vapor turbines as a getter in vacuum tubes and as a photocell component rubidium is also used as an ingredient in special types of glass in the production of superoxide by burning in oxygen in the study of potassium ion channels in biology and as the vapor in atomic magnetometers in particular rb is used with other alkali metals in the development of spin exchange relaxation free serf magnetometers rubidium is used for positron emission tomography rubidium is very similar to potassium and tissue with high potassium content will also accumulate the radioactive rubidium one of the main uses is myocardial perfusion imaging as a result of changes in the blood brain barrier in brain tumors rubidium collects more in brain tumors than normal brain tissue allowing the use of radioisotope rubidium in nuclear medicine to locate and image brain tumors rubidium has a very short half life of seconds and the production from decay of strontium must be done close to the patient rubidium was tested for the influence on manic depression and depression dialysis patients suffering from depression show a depletion in rubidium and therefore a supplementation may help during depression in some tests the rubidium was administered as rubidium chloride with up to mg per day for days precautions and biological effects rubidium reacts violently with water and can cause fires to ensure safety and purity this metal is usually kept under dry mineral oil or sealed in glass ampoules in an inert atmosphere rubidium forms peroxides on exposure even to a small amount of air diffused into the oil and storage is subject to similar precautions as the storage of metallic potassium rubidium like sodium and potassium almost always has oxidation state when dissolved in water even in biological contexts the human body tends to treat rb ions as if they were potassium ions and therefore concentrates rubidium in the body s intracellular fluid i e inside cells the ions are not particularly toxic a kg person contains on average g of rubidium and an increase in this value by to times did not show negative effects in test persons the biological half life of rubidium in humans measures days although a partial substitution of potassium by rubidium is possible when more than of the potassium in the muscle tissue of rats was replaced with rubidium the rats died ,37
Strontium,Sr,strontium is the chemical element with the symbol sr and atomic number an alkaline earth metal strontium is a soft silver white yellowish metallic element that is highly chemically reactive the metal forms a dark oxide layer when it is exposed to air strontium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of its two vertical neighbors in the periodic table calcium and barium it occurs naturally mainly in the minerals celestine and strontianite and is mostly mined from these both strontium and strontianite are named after strontian a village in scotland near which the mineral was discovered in by adair crawford and william cruickshank it was identified as a new element the next year from its crimson red flame test color strontium was first isolated as a metal in by humphry davy using the then newly discovered process of electrolysis during the th century strontium was mostly used in the production of sugar from sugar beets see strontian process at the peak of production of television cathode ray tubes as much as of strontium consumption in the united states was used for the faceplate glass with the replacement of cathode ray tubes with other display methods consumption of strontium has dramatically declined while natural strontium which is mostly the isotope strontium is stable the synthetic strontium is radioactive and is one of the most dangerous components of nuclear fallout as strontium is absorbed by the body in a similar manner to calcium natural stable strontium on the other hand is not hazardous to health characteristics strontium is a divalent silvery metal with a pale yellow tint whose properties are mostly intermediate between and similar to those of its group neighbors calcium and barium it is softer than calcium and harder than barium its melting c and boiling c points are lower than those of calcium c and c respectively barium continues this downward trend in the melting point c but not in the boiling point c the density of strontium g cm is similarly intermediate between those of calcium g cm and barium g cm three allotropes of metallic strontium exist with transition points at and c the standard electrode potential for the sr sr couple is v approximately midway between those of the ca ca v and ba ba v couples and close to those of the neighboring alkali metals strontium is intermediate between calcium and barium in its reactivity toward water with which it reacts on contact to produce strontium hydroxide and hydrogen gas strontium metal burns in air to produce both strontium oxide and strontium nitride but since it does not react with nitrogen below c at room temperature it forms only the oxide spontaneously besides the simple oxide sro the peroxide sro can be made by direct oxidation of strontium metal under a high pressure of oxygen and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide sr o strontium hydroxide sr oh is a strong base though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of barium or the alkali metals all four dihalides of strontium are known due to the large size of the heavy s block elements including strontium a vast range of coordination numbers is known from or all the way to or in srcd and srzn the sr ion is quite large so that high coordination numbers are the rule the large size of strontium and barium plays a significant part in stabilising strontium complexes with polydentate macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers for example while crown forms relatively weak complexes with calcium and the alkali metals its strontium and barium complexes are much stronger organostrontium compounds contain one or more strontium carbon bonds they have been reported as intermediates in barbier type reactions although strontium is in the same group as magnesium and organomagnesium compounds are very commonly used throughout chemistry organostrontium compounds are not similarly widespread because they are more difficult to make and more reactive organostrontium compounds tend to be more similar to organoeuropium or organosamarium compounds due to the similar ionic radii of these elements sr pm eu pm sm pm most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures bulky ligands tend to favor stability for example strontium dicyclopentadienyl sr c h must be made by directly reacting strontium metal with mercurocene or cyclopentadiene itself replacing the c h ligand with the bulkier c ch ligand on the other hand increases the compound s solubility volatility and kinetic stability because of its extreme reactivity with oxygen and water strontium occurs naturally only in compounds with other elements such as in the minerals strontianite and celestine it is kept under a liquid hydrocarbon such as mineral oil or kerosene to prevent oxidation freshly exposed strontium metal rapidly turns a yellowish color with the formation of the oxide finely powdered strontium metal is pyrophoric meaning that it will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature volatile strontium salts impart a bright red color to flames and these salts are used in pyrotechnics and in the production of flares like calcium and barium as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium strontium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution of solvated electrons isotopes natural strontium is a mixture of four stable isotopes sr sr sr and sr their abundance increases with increasing mass number and the heaviest sr makes up about of all natural strontium though the abundance varies due to the production of radiogenic sr as the daughter of long lived beta decaying rb this is the basis of rubidium strontium dating of the unstable isotopes the primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than sr is electron capture or positron emission to isotopes of rubidium and that of the isotopes heavier than sr is electron emission to isotopes of yttrium of special note are sr and sr the former has a half life of days and is used to treat bone cancer due to strontium s chemical similarity and hence ability to replace calcium while sr half life years has been used similarly it is also an isotope of concern in fallout from nuclear weapons and nuclear accidents due to its production as a fission product its presence in bones can cause bone cancer cancer of nearby tissues and leukemia the chernobyl nuclear accident contaminated about km with greater than kbq m with sr which accounts for about of the sr which was in the reactor core history strontium is named after the scottish village of strontian gaelic sr n an t s thein where it was discovered in the ores of the lead mines in adair crawford a physician engaged in the preparation of barium and his colleague william cruickshank recognised that the strontian ores exhibited properties that differed from those in other heavy spars sources this allowed crawford to conclude on page it is probable indeed that the scotch mineral is a new species of earth which has not hitherto been sufficiently examined the physician and mineral collector friedrich gabriel sulzer analysed together with johann friedrich blumenbach the mineral from strontian and named it strontianite he also came to the conclusion that it was distinct from the witherite and contained a new earth neue grunderde in thomas charles hope a professor of chemistry at the university of glasgow studied the mineral and proposed the name strontites he confirmed the earlier work of crawford and recounted considering it a peculiar earth i thought it necessary to give it an name i have called it strontites from the place it was found a mode of derivation in my opinion fully as proper as any quality it may possess which is the present fashion the element was eventually isolated by sir humphry davy in by the electrolysis of a mixture containing strontium chloride and mercuric oxide and announced by him in a lecture to the royal society on june in keeping with the naming of the other alkaline earths he changed the name to strontium the first large scale application of strontium was in the production of sugar from sugar beet although a crystallisation process using strontium hydroxide was patented by augustin pierre dubrunfaut in the large scale introduction came with the improvement of the process in the early s the german sugar industry used the process well into the th century before world war i the beet sugar industry used to tons of strontium hydroxide for this process per year the strontium hydroxide was recycled in the process but the demand to substitute losses during production was high enough to create a significant demand initiating mining of strontianite in the m nsterland the mining of strontianite in germany ended when mining of the celestine deposits in gloucestershire started these mines supplied most of the world strontium supply from to although the celestine deposits in the granada basin were known for some time the large scale mining did not start before the s during atmospheric nuclear weapons testing it was observed that strontium is one of the nuclear fission products with a relatively high yield the similarity to calcium and the chance that the strontium might become enriched in bones made research on the metabolism of strontium an important topic occurrence strontium commonly occurs in nature being the th most abundant element on earth its heavier congener barium being the th estimated to average approximately parts per million in the earth s crust and is found chiefly as the sulfate mineral celestine srso and the carbonate strontianite srco of the two celestine occurs much more frequently in deposits of sufficient size for mining because strontium is used most often in the carbonate form strontianite would be the more useful of the two common minerals but few deposits have been discovered that are suitable for development because of the way it reacts with air and water strontium only exists in nature when combined to form minerals naturally occurring strontium is stable but its synthetic isotope sr is only produced by nuclear fallout in groundwater strontium behaves chemically much like calcium at intermediate to acidic ph sr is the dominant strontium species in the presence of calcium ions strontium commonly forms coprecipitates with calcium minerals such as calcite and anhydrite at an increased ph at intermediate to acidic ph dissolved strontium is bound to soil particles by cation exchange the mean strontium content of ocean water is mg l at a concentration between and mol l of strontium the concentration is considerably lower than the calcium concentration which is normally between and mmol l it is nevertheless much higher than that of barium g l production the three major producers of strontium as celestine as of are china t spain t and mexico t argentina t and morocco t are smaller producers although strontium deposits occur widely in the united states they have not been mined since a large proportion of mined celestine srso is converted to the carbonate by two processes either the celestine is directly leached with sodium carbonate solution or the celestine is roasted with coal to form the sulfide the second stage produces a dark coloured material containing mostly strontium sulfide this so called black ash is dissolved in water and filtered strontium carbonate is precipitated from the strontium sulfide solution by introduction of carbon dioxide the sulfate is reduced to the sulfide by the carbothermic reduction srso c srs co about tons are processed in this way annually the metal is produced commercially by reducing strontium oxide with aluminium the strontium is distilled from the mixture strontium metal can also be prepared on a small scale by electrolysis of a solution of strontium chloride in molten potassium chloride sr e sr cl cl e applications consuming of production the primary use for strontium was in glass for colour television cathode ray tubes where it prevented x ray emission this application for strontium has been declining because crts are being replaced by other display methods this decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium all parts of the crt must absorb x rays in the neck and the funnel of the tube lead glass is used for this purpose but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to the interaction of the x rays with the glass therefore the front panel is made from a different glass mixture with strontium and barium to absorb the x rays the average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in is strontium oxide and barium oxide because strontium is so similar to calcium it is incorporated in the bone all four stable isotopes are incorporated in roughly the same proportions they are found in nature however the actual distribution of the isotopes tends to vary greatly from one geographical location to another thus analyzing the bone of an individual can help determine the region it came from this approach helps to identify the ancient migration patterns and the origin of commingled human remains in battlefield burial sites sr sr ratios are commonly used to determine the likely provenance areas of sediment in natural systems especially in marine and fluvial environments dasch showed that surface sediments of atlantic displayed sr sr ratios that could be regarded as bulk averages of the sr sr ratios of geological terrains from adjacent landmasses a good example of a fluvial marine system to which sr isotope provenance studies have been successfully employed is the river nile mediterranean system due to the differing ages of the rocks that constitute the majority of the blue and white nile catchment areas of the changing provenance of sediment reaching the river nile delta and east mediterranean sea can be discerned through strontium isotopic studies such changes are climatically controlled in the late quaternary more recently sr sr ratios have also been used to determine the source of ancient archaeological materials such as timbers and corn in chaco canyon new mexico sr sr ratios in teeth may also be used to track animal migrations strontium aluminate is frequently used in glow in the dark toys as it is chemically and biologically inert strontium carbonate and other strontium salts are added to fireworks to give a deep red colour this same effect identifies strontium cations in the flame test fireworks consume about of the world s production strontium carbonate is used in the manufacturing of hard ferrite magnets strontium chloride is sometimes used in toothpastes for sensitive teeth one popular brand includes total strontium chloride hexahydrate by weight small amounts are used in the refining of zinc to remove small amounts of lead impurities the metal itself has a limited use as a getter to remove unwanted gases in vacuums by reacting with them although barium may also be used for this purpose the ultra narrow optical transition between the kr s s electronic ground state and the metastable kr s p p excited state of sr is one of the leading candidates for the future re definition of the second in terms of an optical transition as opposed to the current definition derived from a microwave transition between different hyperfine ground states of cs current optical atomic clocks operating on this transition already surpass the precision and accuracy of the current definition of the second radioactive strontium sr is the active ingredient in metastron a radiopharmaceutical used for bone pain secondary to metastatic bone cancer the strontium is processed like calcium by the body preferentially incorporating it into bone at sites of increased osteogenesis this localization focuses the radiation exposure on the cancerous lesion sr has been used as a power source for radioisotope thermoelectric generators rtgs sr produces approximately watts of heat per gram it is lower for the form of sr used in rtgs which is strontium fluoride however sr has one third the lifetime and a lower density than pu another rtg fuel the main advantage of sr is that it is cheaper than pu and is found in nuclear waste the soviet union deployed nearly of these rtgs on its northern coast as a power source for lighthouses and meteorology stations biological role acantharea a relatively large group of marine radiolarian protozoa produce intricate mineral skeletons composed of strontium sulfate in biological systems calcium is substituted to a small extent by strontium in the human body most of the absorbed strontium is deposited in the bones the ratio of strontium to calcium in human bones is between and roughly in the same range as in the blood serum effect on the human body the human body absorbs strontium as if it were its lighter congener calcium because the elements are chemically very similar stable strontium isotopes do not pose a significant health threat the average human has an intake of about two milligrams of strontium a day in adults strontium consumed tends to attach only to the surface of bones but in children strontium can replace calcium in the mineral of the growing bones and thus lead to bone growth problems the biological half life of strontium in humans has variously been reported as from to days days years years and at an upper limit years the wide ranging published biological half life figures are explained by strontium s complex metabolism within the body however by averaging all excretion paths the overall biological half life is estimated to be about years the elimination rate of strontium is strongly affected by age and sex due to differences in bone metabolism the drug strontium ranelate aids bone growth increases bone density and lessens the incidence of vertebral peripheral and hip fractures however strontium ranelate also increases the risk of venous thromboembolism pulmonary embolism and serious cardiovascular disorders including myocardial infarction its use is therefore now restricted its beneficial effects are also questionable since the increased bone density is partially caused by the increased density of strontium over the calcium which it replaces strontium also bioaccumulates in the body despite restrictions on strontium ranelate strontium is still contained in some supplements there is not much scientific evidence on risks of strontium chloride when taken by mouth those

strontium has been shown to accelerate the recovery rate of the epidermal permeability barrier skin barrier nuclear waste strontium is a radioactive fission product produced by nuclear reactors used in nuclear power it is a major component of high level radioactivity of nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel its year half life is short enough that its decay heat has been used to power arctic lighthouses but long enough that it can take hundreds of years to decay to safe levels exposure from contaminated water and food may increase the risk of leukemia bone cancer and primary hyperparathyroidism remediation algae has shown selectivity for strontium in studies where most plants used in bioremediation have not shown selectivity between calcium and strontium often becoming saturated with calcium which is greater in quantity and also present in nuclear waste researchers have looked at the bioaccumulation of strontium by scenedesmus spinosus algae in simulated wastewater the study claims a highly selective biosorption capacity for strontium of s spinosus suggesting that it may be appropriate for use of nuclear wastewater a study of the pond alga closterium moniliferum

Yttrium,Y,yttrium is a chemical element with the symbol y and atomic number it is a silvery metallic transition metal chemically similar to the lanthanides and has often been classified as a rare earth element yttrium is almost always found in combination with lanthanide elements in rare earth minerals and is never found in nature as a free element y is the only stable isotope and the only isotope found in the earth s crust the most important uses of yttrium are leds and phosphors particularly the red phosphors in television set cathode ray tube displays yttrium is also used in the production of electrodes electrolytes electronic filters lasers superconductors various medical applications and tracing various materials to enhance their properties yttrium has no known biological role exposure to yttrium compounds can cause lung disease in humans the element is named after ytterbite a mineral first identified in by the chemist carl axel arrhenius he named the mineral after the village of ytterby in sweden where it had been discovered when one of the chemicals in ytterbite was later found to be the previously unidentified element yttrium the element was then named after the mineral characteristics properties yttrium is a soft silver metallic lustrous and highly crystalline transition metal in group as expected by periodic trends it is less electronegative than its predecessor in the group scandium and less electronegative than the next member of period zirconium additionally it is more electronegative than lanthanum but less electronegative than lutetium due to the lanthanide contraction yttrium is the first d block element in the fifth period the pure element is relatively stable in air in bulk form due to passivation of a protective oxide y o film that forms on the surface this film can reach a thickness of m when yttrium is heated to c in water vapor when finely divided however yttrium is very unstable in air shavings or turnings of the metal can ignite in air at temperatures exceeding c yttrium nitride yn is formed when the metal is heated to c in nitrogen similarity to the lanthanides the similarities of yttrium to the lanthanides are so strong that the element has historically been grouped with them as a rare earth element and is always found in nature together with them in rare earth minerals chemically yttrium resembles those elements more closely than its neighbor in the periodic table scandium and if physical properties were plotted against atomic number it would have an apparent number of to placing it between the lanthanides gadolinium and erbium it often also falls in the same range for reaction order resembling terbium and dysprosium in its chemical reactivity yttrium is so close in size to the so called yttrium group of heavy lanthanide ions that in solution it behaves as if it were one of them even though the lanthanides are one row farther down the periodic table than yttrium the similarity in atomic radius may be attributed to the lanthanide contraction one of the few notable differences between the chemistry of yttrium and that of the lanthanides is that yttrium is almost exclusively trivalent whereas about half the lanthanides can have valences other than three nevertheless only for four of the fifteen lanthanides are these other valences important in aqueous solution ceiv smii euii and ybii compounds and reactions as a trivalent transition metal yttrium forms various inorganic compounds generally in the oxidation state of by giving up all three of its valence electrons a good example is yttrium iii oxide y o also known as yttria a six coordinate white solid yttrium forms a water insoluble fluoride hydroxide and oxalate but its bromide chloride iodide nitrate and sulfate are all soluble in water the y ion is colorless in solution because of the absence of electrons in the d and f electron shells water readily reacts with yttrium and its compounds to form y o concentrated nitric and hydrofluoric acids do not rapidly attack yttrium but other strong acids do with halogens yttrium forms trihalides such as yttrium iii fluoride yf yttrium iii chloride ycl and yttrium iii bromide ybr at temperatures above roughly c similarly carbon phosphorus selenium silicon and sulfur all form binary compounds with yttrium at elevated temperatures organoyttrium chemistry is the study of compounds containing carbon yttrium bonds a few of these are known to have yttrium in the oxidation state the state has been observed in chloride melts and in oxide clusters in the gas phase some trimerization reactions were generated with organoyttrium compounds as catalysts these syntheses use ycl as a starting material obtained from y o and concentrated hydrochloric acid and ammonium chloride hapticity is a term to describe the coordination of a group of contiguous atoms of a ligand bound to the central atom it is indicated by the greek character eta yttrium complexes were the first examples of complexes where carboranyl ligands were bound to a d metal center through a hapticity vaporization of the graphite intercalation compounds graphite y or graphite y o leads to the formation of endohedral fullerenes such as y c electron spin resonance studies indicated the formation of y and c ion pairs the carbides y c y c and yc can be hydrolyzed to form hydrocarbons isotopes and nucleosynthesis yttrium in the solar system was created through stellar nucleosynthesis mostly by the s process but also by the r process the r process consists of rapid neutron capture by lighter elements during supernova explosions the s process is a slow neutron capture of lighter elements inside pulsating red giant stars yttrium isotopes are among the most common products of the nuclear fission of uranium in nuclear explosions and nuclear reactors in the context of nuclear waste management the most important isotopes of yttrium are y and y with half lives of days and hours respectively though y has a short half life it exists in secular equilibrium with its long lived parent isotope strontium sr with a half life of years all group elements have an odd atomic number and therefore few stable isotopes scandium has one stable isotope and yttrium itself has only one stable isotope y which is also the only isotope that occurs naturally however the lanthanide rare earths contain elements of even atomic number and many stable isotopes yttrium is thought to be more abundant than it otherwise would be due in part to the s process which allows enough time for isotopes created by other processes to decay by electron emission neutron proton such a slow process tends to favor isotopes with atomic mass numbers a protons neutrons around and which have unusually stable atomic nuclei with and neutrons respectively this stability is thought to result from their very low neutron capture cross section greenwood pp electron emission of isotopes with those mass numbers is simply less prevalent due to this stability resulting in them having a higher abundance y has a mass number close to and has neutrons in its nucleus at least synthetic isotopes of yttrium have been observed and these range in atomic mass number from to the least stable of these is y with a half life of ns y has a half life of ns and the most stable is y with a half life of days apart from the isotopes y y and y with half lives of days hours and hours respectively all the other isotopes have half lives of less than a day and most of less than an hour yttrium isotopes with mass numbers at or below decay primarily by positron emission proton neutron to form strontium z isotopes yttrium isotopes with mass numbers at or above decay primarily by electron emission neutron proton to form zirconium z isotopes isotopes with mass numbers at or above are also known to have minor decay paths of delayed neutron emission yttrium has at least metastable excited isomers ranging in mass number from to multiple excitation states have been observed for y and y while most of yttrium s isomers are expected to be less stable than their ground state my my my my m y my and my have longer half lives than their ground states as these isomers decay by beta decay rather than isomeric transition history in part time chemist carl axel arrhenius found a heavy black rock in an old quarry near the swedish village of ytterby now part of the stockholm archipelago thinking it was an unknown mineral containing the newly discovered element tungsten he named it ytterbite and sent samples to various chemists for analysis johan gadolin at the university of bo identified a new oxide or earth in arrhenius sample in and published his completed analysis in anders gustaf ekeberg confirmed the identification in and named the new oxide yttria in the decades after antoine lavoisier developed the first modern definition of chemical elements it was believed that earths could be reduced to their elements meaning that the discovery of a new earth was equivalent to the discovery of the element within which in this case would have been yttrium friedrich w hler is credited with first isolating the metal in by reacting a volatile chloride that he believed to be yttrium chloride with potassium in carl gustaf mosander found that samples of yttria contained three oxides white yttrium oxide yttria yellow terbium oxide confusingly this was called erbia at the time and rose colored erbium oxide called terbia at the time a fourth oxide ytterbium oxide was isolated in by jean charles galissard de marignac new elements were later isolated from each of those oxides and each element was named in some fashion after ytterby the village near the quarry where they were found see ytterbium terbium and erbium in the following decades seven other new metals were discovered in gadolin s yttria since yttria was found to be a mineral and not an oxide martin heinrich klaproth renamed it gadolinite in honor of gadolin until the early s the chemical symbol yt was used for the element after which y came into common use in yttrium barium copper oxide was found to achieve high temperature superconductivity it was only the second material known to exhibit this property and it was the first known material to achieve superconductivity above the economically important boiling point of nitrogen occurrence abundance yttrium is found in most rare earth minerals it is found in some uranium ores but is never found in the earth s crust as a free element about ppm of the earth s crust is yttrium making it the th most abundant element times more common than silver yttrium is found in soil in concentrations between and ppm dry weight average of ppm and in sea water at ppt lunar rock samples collected during the american apollo project have a relatively high content of yttrium yttrium has no known biological role though it is found in most if not all organisms and tends to concentrate in the liver kidney spleen lungs and bones of humans normally as little as milligrams gr is found in the entire human body human breast milk contains ppm yttrium can be found in edible plants in concentrations between ppm and ppm fresh weight with cabbage having the largest amount with as much as ppm the seeds of woody plants have the highest known concentrations as of april there are reports of the discovery of very large reserves of rare earth elements on a tiny japanese island minami torishima island also known as marcus island is described as having tremendous potential for rare earth elements and yttrium rey according to a study published in scientific reports this rey rich mud has great potential as a rare earth metal resource because of the enormous amount available and its advantageous mineralogical features the study reads the study shows that more than million short tons billion kilograms of rare earth elements could be exploited in the near future including yttrium y which is used in products like camera lenses and mobile phone screens the rare earth elements found are europium eu terbium tb and dysprosium dy production as yttrium is chemically similar to lanthanides it occurs in the same ores rare earth minerals and is extracted by the same refinement processes a slight distinction is recognized between the light lree and the heavy rare earth elements hree but the distinction is not perfect yttrium is concentrated in the hree group because of its ion size though it has a lower atomic mass rare earth elements rees come mainly from four sources carbonate and fluoride containing ores such as the lree bastn site ce la etc co f contain an average of of yttrium compared to the for the other rees the main source for bastn site from the s to the s was the mountain pass rare earth mine in california making the united states the largest producer of rees during that period the name bastn site is actually a group name and the levinson suffix is used in the correct mineral names e g b stnasite y has y as a prevailing element monazite ce la etc po which is mostly phosphate is a placer deposit of sand created by the transportation and gravitational separation of eroded granite monazite as a lree ore contains or yttrium the largest deposits were found in india and brazil in the early th century making those two countries the largest producers of yttrium in the first half of that century of the monazite group the ce dominant member monazite ce is the most common one xenotime a ree phosphate is the main hree ore containing as much as yttrium as yttrium phosphate ypo this applies to xenotime y the largest mine is the bayan obo deposit in china making china the largest exporter for hree since the closure of the mountain pass mine in the s ion absorption clays or lognan clays are the weathering products of granite and contain only of rees the final ore concentrate can contain as much as yttrium ion absorption clays are mostly in southern china yttrium is also found in samarskite and fergusonite which also stand for group names one method for obtaining pure yttrium from the mixed oxide ores is to dissolve the oxide in sulfuric acid and fractionate it by ion exchange chromatography with the addition of oxalic acid the yttrium oxalate precipitates the oxalate is converted into the oxide by heating under oxygen by reacting the resulting yttrium oxide with hydrogen fluoride yttrium fluoride is obtained when quaternary ammonium salts are used as extractants most yttrium will remain in the aqueous phase when the counter ion is nitrate the light lanthanides are removed and when the counter ion is thiocyanate the heavy lanthanides are removed in this way yttrium salts of purity are obtained in the usual situation where yttrium is in a mixture that is two thirds heavy lanthanide yttrium should be removed as soon as possible to facilitate the separation of the remaining elements annual world production of yttrium oxide had reached tonnes short tons by by it had increased to tonnes short tons global reserves of yttrium oxide were estimated in to be more than tonnes short tons the leading countries for these reserves included australia brazil china india and the united states only a few tonnes of yttrium metal are produced each year by reducing yttrium fluoride to a metal sponge with calcium magnesium alloy the temperature of an arc furnace of greater than c is sufficient to melt the yttrium applications consumer the red component of color television cathode ray tubes is typically emitted from an yttria y o or yttrium oxide sulfide y o s host lattice doped with europium iii cation eu phosphors the red color itself is emitted from the europium while the yttrium collects energy from the electron gun and passes it to the phosphor yttrium compounds can serve as host lattices for doping with different lanthanide cations tb can be used as a doping agent to produce green luminescence as such yttrium compounds such as yttrium aluminium garnet yag are useful for phosphors and are an important component of white leds yttria is used as a sintering additive in the production of porous silicon nitride yttrium compounds are used as a catalyst for ethylene polymerization as a metal yttrium is used on the electrodes of some high performance spark plugs yttrium is used in gas mantles

yttrium is used to increase the strength of aluminium and magnesium alloys the addition of yttrium to alloys generally improves workability adds resistance to high temperature recrystallization and significantly enhances resistance to high temperature oxidation see graphite nodule discussion below yttrium can be used to deoxidize vanadium and other non ferrous metals yttria stabilizes the cubic form of zirconia in jewelry yttrium has been studied as a nodulizer in ductile cast iron forming the graphite into compact nodules instead of flakes to increase ductility and fatigue resistance having a high melting point yttrium oxide is used in some ceramic and glass to impart shock resistance and low thermal expansion properties those same properties make such glass useful in camera lenses medical the radioactive isotope yttrium is used in drugs such as yttrium y dota tyr octreotide and yttrium y ibritumomab tiuxetan for the treatment of various cancers including lymphoma leukemia liver ovarian colorectal pancreatic and bone cancers it works by adhering to monoclonal antibodies which in turn bind to cancer cells and kill them via intense radiation from the yttrium see monoclonal antibody therapy a technique called radioembolization is used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis radioembolization is a low toxicity targeted liver cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium the radioactive microspheres are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors segments or lobes it is minimally invasive and patients can usually be discharged after a few hours this procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver but works on one segment or one lobe at a time and may require multiple procedures also see radioembolization in the case of combined cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma needles made of yttrium which can cut more precisely than scalpels have been used to sever pain transmitting nerves in the spinal cord and yttrium is also used to carry out radionuclide synovectomy in the treatment of inflamed joints especially knees in sufferers of conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis a neodymium doped yttrium aluminium garnet laser has been used in an experimental robot assisted radical prostatectomy in canines in an attempt to reduce collateral nerve and tissue damage and erbium doped lasers are coming into use for cosmetic skin resurfacing superconductors yttrium is a key ingredient in the yttrium barium copper oxide yba cu o aka ybco or superconductor developed at the university of alabama and the university of houston in this superconductor is notable because the operating superconductivity temperature is above liquid nitrogen s boiling point k since liquid nitrogen is less expensive than the liquid helium required for metallic superconductors the operating costs for applications would be less the actual superconducting material is often written as yba cu o d where d must be less than for superconductivity the reason for this is still not clear but it is known that the vacancies occur only in certain places in the crystal the copper oxide planes and chains giving rise to a peculiar oxidation state of the copper atoms which somehow leads to the superconducting behavior the theory of low temperature superconductivity has been well understood since the bcs theory of it is based on a peculiarity of the interaction between two electrons in a crystal lattice however the bcs theory does not explain high temperature superconductivity and its precise mechanism is still a mystery what is known is that the composition of the copper oxide materials must be precisely controlled for superconductivity

elements hoping to develop a practical high temperature superconductor lithium batteries yttrium is used in small quantities in cathodes of some lithium iron phosphate battery lfp and then called commonly lifeypo chemistry or lyp similar to lfp lyp batteries offer high energy density good safety and long life but lyp offer higher cathode stability and prolong life of battery by protecting physical structure of the cathode especially at higher temperatures and higher charging discharge current lyp batteries do find use in stationary applications off grid solar systems electric vehicles some cars as well other applications submarines ships similar to lfp batteries but often at improved safety and cycle life time lyp cells have essentially same nominal voltage as lfp of v but the maximum charging voltage is v and very similar charging and discharge characteristic other applications in professor mas subramanian and associates at oregon state university discovered that yttrium can be combined with indium and manganese to form an intensely blue non toxic inert fade resistant pigment yinmn blue the first new blue pigment discovered in years precautions yttrium currently has no known biological role and it can be highly toxic to humans animals and plants water soluble compounds of yttrium are considered mildly toxic while its insoluble compounds are non toxic in experiments on animals yttrium and its compounds caused lung and liver damage though toxicity varies with different yttrium compounds in rats inhalation of yttrium citrate caused pulmonary edema and dyspnea while inhalation of yttrium chloride caused liver edema pleural effusions and pulmonary hyperemia exposure to yttrium compounds in humans may cause lung disease workers exposed to airborne yttrium europium vanadate dust experienced mild eye skin and upper respiratory tract irritation though this may be caused by the vanadium content rather than the yttrium acute exposure to yttrium compounds can cause shortness of breath coughing chest pain and cyanosis the occupational safety and health administration osha limits exposure to yttrium in the workplace to mg m oz cu in over an

dangerous to life and health yttrium dust is highly flammable ,39
Zirconium,Zr,zirconium is a chemical element with the symbol zr and atomic number the name zirconium is taken from the name of the mineral zircon the most important source of zirconium the word is related to persian zargun zircon zar gun gold like or as gold it is a lustrous grey white strong transition metal that closely resembles hafnium and to a lesser extent titanium zirconium is mainly used as a refractory and opacifier although small amounts are used as an alloying agent for its strong resistance to corrosion zirconium forms a variety of inorganic and organometallic compounds such as zirconium dioxide and zirconocene dichloride respectively five isotopes occur naturally four of which are stable zirconium compounds have no known biological role characteristics zirconium is a lustrous greyish white soft ductile malleable metal that is solid at room temperature though it is hard and brittle at lesser purities in powder form zirconium is highly flammable but the solid form is much less prone to ignition zirconium is highly resistant to corrosion by alkalis acids salt water and other agents however it will dissolve in hydrochloric and sulfuric acid especially when fluorine is present alloys with zinc are magnetic at less than k the melting point of zirconium is c f and the boiling point is c f zirconium has an electronegativity of on the pauling scale of the elements within the d block with known electronegativities zirconium has the fifth lowest electronegativity after hafnium yttrium lanthanum and actinium at room temperature zirconium exhibits a hexagonally close packed crystal structure zr which changes to zr a body centered cubic crystal structure at c zirconium exists in the phase until the melting point isotopes naturally occurring zirconium is composed of five isotopes zr zr zr and zr are stable although zr is predicted to undergo double beta decay not observed experimentally with a half life of more than years zr has a half life of years and is the longest lived radioisotope of zirconium of these natural isotopes zr is the most common making up of all zirconium zr is the least common comprising only of zirconium twenty eight artificial isotopes of zirconium have been synthesized ranging in atomic mass from to zr is the longest lived artificial isotope with a half life of years zr the heaviest isotope of zirconium is the most radioactive with an estimated half life of milliseconds radioactive isotopes at or above mass number decay by electron emission whereas those at or below decay by positron emission the only exception is zr which decays by electron capture five isotopes of zirconium also exist as metastable isomers mzr mzr mzr m zr m zr and mzr of these m zr has the shortest half life at nanoseconds mzr is the longest lived with a half life of minutes occurrence zirconium has a concentration of about mg kg within the earth s crust and about g l in sea water it is not found in nature as a native metal reflecting its intrinsic instability with respect to water the principal commercial source of zirconium is zircon zrsio a silicate mineral which is found primarily in australia brazil india russia south africa and the united states as well as in smaller deposits around the world as of two thirds of zircon mining occurs in australia and south africa zircon resources exceed million tonnes worldwide and annual worldwide zirconium production is approximately tonnes zirconium also occurs in more than other minerals including the commercially useful ores baddeleyite and eudialyte zirconium is relatively abundant in s type stars and it has been detected in the sun and in meteorites lunar rock samples brought back from several apollo missions to the moon have a high zirconium oxide content relative to terrestrial rocks epr spectroscopy has been used in investigations of the unusual valence state of zirconium the epr spectrum of zr which has been initially observed as a parasitic signal in fe doped single crystals of scpo was definitively identified by preparing single crystals of scpo doped with isotopically enriched zr single crystals of lupo and ypo doped with both naturally abundant and isotopically enriched zr have also been grown and investigated production occurrence zirconium is a by product of the mining and processing of the titanium minerals ilmenite and rutile as well as tin mining from to while prices for the mineral zircon steadily increased from to per tonne the price for unwrought zirconium metal decreased from to per ton zirconium metal is much more expensive than zircon because the reduction processes are costly collected from coastal waters zircon bearing sand is purified by spiral concentrators to separate lighter materials which are then returned to the water because they are natural components of beach sand using magnetic separation the titanium ores ilmenite and rutile are removed most zircon is used directly in commercial applications but a small percentage is converted to the metal most zr metal is produced by the reduction of the zirconium iv chloride with magnesium metal in the kroll process the resulting metal is sintered until sufficiently ductile for metalworking separation of zirconium and hafnium commercial zirconium metal typically contains of hafnium which is usually not problematic because the chemical properties of hafnium and zirconium are very similar their neutron absorbing properties differ strongly however necessitating the separation of hafnium from zirconium for nuclear reactors several separation schemes are in use the liquid liquid extraction of the thiocyanate oxide derivatives exploits the fact that the hafnium derivative is slightly more soluble in methyl isobutyl ketone than in water this method is used mainly in united states in india tbp nitrate solvent extraction process is used for the separation zr and hf can also be separated by fractional crystallization of potassium hexafluorozirconate k zrf which is less soluble in water than the analogous hafnium derivative fractional distillation of the tetrachlorides also called extractive distillation is used primarily in europe the product of a quadruple vam vacuum arc melting process combined with hot extruding and different rolling applications is cured using high pressure high temperature gas autoclaving this produces reactor grade zirconium that is about times more expensive than the hafnium contaminated commercial grade hafnium must be removed from zirconium for nuclear applications because hafnium has a neutron absorption cross section times greater than zirconium the separated hafnium can be used for reactor control rods compounds like other transition metals zirconium forms a wide range of inorganic compounds and coordination complexes in general these compounds are colourless diamagnetic solids wherein zirconium has the oxidation state far fewer zr iii compounds are known and zr ii is very rare oxides nitrides and carbides the most common oxide is zirconium dioxide zro also known as zirconia this clear to white coloured solid has exceptional fracture toughness for a ceramic and chemical resistance especially in its cubic form these properties make zirconia useful as a thermal barrier coating although it is also a common diamond substitute zirconium monoxide zro is also known and s type stars are recognised by detection of its emission lines zirconium tungstate has the unusual property of shrinking in all dimensions when heated whereas most other substances expand when heated zirconyl chloride is a rare water soluble zirconium complex with the relatively complicated formula zr oh h o cl zirconium carbide and zirconium nitride are refractory solids the carbide is used for drilling tools and cutting edges zirconium hydride phases are also known lead zirconate titanate pzt is the most commonly used piezoelectric material with applications such as ultrasonic transducers hydrophones common rail injectors piezoelectric transformers and micro actuators halides and pseudohalides all four common halides are known zrf zrcl zrbr and zri all have polymeric structures and are far less volatile than the corresponding monomeric titanium tetrahalides all tend to hydrolyse to give the so called oxyhalides and dioxides the corresponding tetraalkoxides are also known unlike the halides the alkoxides dissolve in nonpolar solvents dihydrogen hexafluorozirconate is used in the metal finishing industry as an etching agent to promote paint adhesion organic derivatives organozirconium chemistry is key to ziegler natta catalysts used to produce polypropylene this application exploits the ability of zirconium to reversibly form bonds to carbon zirconocene dibromide c h zrbr reported in by birmingham and wilkinson was the first organozirconium compound schwartz s reagent prepared in by p c wailes and h weigold is a metallocene used in organic synthesis for transformations of alkenes and alkynes most complexes of zr ii are derivatives of zirconocene one example being c me zr co history the zirconium containing mineral zircon and related minerals jargoon hyacinth jacinth ligure were mentioned in biblical writings the mineral was not known to contain a new element until when klaproth analyzed a jargoon from the island of ceylon now sri lanka he named the new element zirkonerde zirconia humphry davy attempted to isolate this new element in through electrolysis but failed zirconium metal was first obtained in an impure form in by berzelius by heating a mixture of potassium and potassium zirconium fluoride in an iron tube the crystal bar process also known as the iodide process discovered by anton eduard van arkel and jan hendrik de boer in was the first industrial process for the commercial production of metallic zirconium it involves the formation and subsequent thermal decomposition of zirconium tetraiodide and was superseded in by the much cheaper kroll process developed by william justin kroll in which zirconium tetrachloride is reduced by magnesium zrcl mg zr mgcl displaystyle ce zrcl mg zr mgcl applications approximately tonnes of zirconium ores were mined in mostly as zircon compounds most zircon is used directly in high temperature applications because it is refractory hard and resistant to chemical attack zircon finds many applications its main use is as an opacifier conferring a white opaque appearance to ceramic materials because of its chemical resistance zircon is also used in aggressive environments such as moulds for molten metals zirconium dioxide zro is used in laboratory crucibles in metallurgical furnaces and as a refractory material because it is mechanically strong and flexible it can be sintered into ceramic knives and other blades zircon zrsio and cubic zirconia zro are cut into gemstones for use in jewelry zirconium dioxide is a component in some abrasives such as grinding wheels and sandpaper metal a small fraction of the zircon is converted to the metal which finds various niche applications because of zirconium s excellent resistance to corrosion it is often used as an alloying agent in materials that are exposed to aggressive environments such as surgical appliances light filaments and watch cases the high reactivity of zirconium with oxygen at high temperatures is exploited in some specialised applications such as explosive primers and as getters in vacuum tubes the same property is probably the purpose of including zr nanoparticles as pyrophoric material in explosive weapons such as the blu b combined effects bomb burning zirconium was used as a light source in some photographic flashbulbs zirconium powder with a mesh size from to is occasionally used in pyrotechnic compositions to generate sparks the high reactivity of zirconium leads to bright white sparks nuclear applications cladding for nuclear reactor fuels consumes about of the zirconium supply mainly in the form of zircaloys the desired properties of these alloys are a low neutron capture cross section and resistance to corrosion under normal service conditions efficient methods for removing the hafnium impurities were developed to serve this purpose one disadvantage of zirconium alloys is the reactivity with water producing hydrogen leading to degradation of the fuel rod cladding zr h o zro h displaystyle ce zr h o zro h hydrolysis is very slow below c but rapid at temperature above c most metals undergo similar reactions the redox reaction is relevant to the instability of fuel assemblies at high temperatures this reaction occurred in the reactors and of the fukushima i nuclear power plant japan after the reactor cooling was interrupted by the earthquake and tsunami disaster of march leading to the fukushima i nuclear accidents after venting the hydrogen in the maintenance hall of those three reactors the mixture of hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen exploded severely damaging the installations and at least one of the containment buildings zirconium is a constituent of the uranium zirconium hydride uzrh nuclear fuel used in triga reactors space and aeronautic industries materials fabricated from zirconium metal and zro are used in space vehicles where resistance to heat is needed high temperature parts such as combustors blades and vanes in jet engines and stationary gas turbines are increasingly being protected by thin ceramic layers usually composed of a mixture of zirconia and yttria medical uses zirconium bearing compounds are used in many biomedical applications including dental implants and crowns knee and hip replacements middle ear ossicular chain reconstruction and other restorative and prosthetic devices zirconium binds urea a property that has been utilized extensively to the benefit of patients with chronic kidney disease for example zirconium is a primary component of the sorbent column dependent dialysate regeneration and recirculation system known as the redy system which was first introduced in more than dialysis treatments have been performed using the sorbent column in the redy system although the redy system was superseded in the s by less expensive alternatives new sorbent based dialysis systems are being evaluated and approved by the u s food and drug administration fda renal solutions developed the dialisorb technology a portable low water dialysis system also developmental versions of a wearable artificial kidney have incorporated sorbent based technologies sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is used by mouth in the treatment of hyperkalemia it is a selective sorbent designed to trap potassium ions in preference to other ions throughout the gastrointestinal tract a mixture of monomeric and polymeric zr and al complexes with hydroxide chloride and glycine called aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly or azg is used in a preparation as an antiperspirant in many deodorant products it is selected for its ability to obstruct pores in the skin and prevent sweat from leaving the body defunct applications zirconium carbonate zro co h o was used in lotions to treat poison ivy but was discontinued because it occasionally caused skin reactions safety although zirconium has no known biological role the human body contains on average milligrams of zirconium and daily intake is approximately milligrams milligrams from food and milligrams from water depending on dietary habits zirconium is widely distributed in nature and is found in all biological systems for example g g in whole wheat g g in brown rice g g in spinach g g in eggs and g g in ground beef further zirconium is commonly used in commercial products e g deodorant sticks aerosol antiperspirants and also in water purification e g control of phosphorus pollution bacteria and pyrogen contaminated water short term exposure to zirconium powder can cause irritation but only contact with the eyes requires medical attention persistent exposure to zirconium tetrachloride results in increased mortality in rats and guinea pigs and a decrease of blood hemoglobin and red blood cells in dogs however in a study of rats given a standard diet containing zirconium oxide there were no adverse effects on growth rate blood and urine parameters or mortality the u s occupational safety and health

Niobium,Nb,niobium is a chemical element with chemical symbol nb formerly columbium cb and atomic number it is a light grey crystalline and ductile transition metal pure niobium has a mohs hardness rating similar to pure titanium and it has similar ductility to iron niobium oxidizes in earth s atmosphere very slowly hence its application in jewelry as a hypoallergenic alternative to nickel niobium is often found in the minerals pyrochlore and columbite hence the former name columbium its name comes from greek mythology niobe daughter of tantalus the namesake of tantalum the name reflects the great similarity between the two elements in their physical and chemical properties which makes them difficult to distinguish english chemist charles hatchett reported a new element similar to tantalum in and named it columbium in english chemist william hyde wollaston wrongly concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical german chemist heinrich rose determined in that tantalum ores contain a second element which he named niobium in and a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element as distinguished from tantalum and for a century both names were used interchangeably niobium was officially adopted as the name of the element in but the name columbium remains in current use in metallurgy in the united states it was not until the early th century that niobium was first used commercially niobium is an important addition to high strength low alloy steels brazil is the leading producer of niobium and ferroniobium an alloy of niobium with iron niobium is used mostly in alloys the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines although these alloys contain a maximum of the small percentage of niobium enhances the strength of the steel by scavenging carbide and nitride the temperature stability of niobium containing superalloys is important for its use in jet and rocket engines niobium is used in various superconducting materials these alloys also containing titanium and tin are widely used in the superconducting magnets of mri scanners other applications of niobium include welding nuclear industries electronics optics numismatics and jewelry in the last two applications the low toxicity and iridescence produced by anodization are highly desired properties niobium is considered a technology critical element history niobium was identified by english chemist charles hatchett in he found a new element in a mineral sample that had been sent to england from connecticut united states in by john winthrop f r s grandson of john winthrop the younger and named the mineral columbite and the new element columbium after columbia the poetic name for the united states the columbium discovered by hatchett was probably a mixture of the new element with tantalum subsequently there was considerable confusion over the difference between columbium niobium and the closely related tantalum in english chemist william hyde wollaston compared the oxides derived from both columbium columbite with a density g cm and tantalum tantalite with a density over g cm and concluded that the two oxides despite the significant difference in density were identical thus he kept the name tantalum this conclusion was disputed in by german chemist heinrich rose who argued that there were two different elements in the tantalite sample and named them after children of tantalus niobium from niobe and pelopium from pelops this confusion arose from the minimal observed differences between tantalum and niobium the claimed new elements pelopium ilmenium and dianium were in fact identical to niobium or mixtures of niobium and tantalum the differences between tantalum and niobium were unequivocally demonstrated in by christian wilhelm blomstrand and henri tienne sainte claire deville as well as louis j troost who determined the formulas of some of the compounds in and finally by swiss chemist jean charles galissard de marignac in who all proved that there were only two elements articles on ilmenium continued to appear until de marignac was the first to prepare the metal in when he reduced niobium chloride by heating it in an atmosphere of hydrogen although de marignac was able to produce tantalum free niobium on a larger scale by it was not until the early th century that niobium was used in incandescent lamp filaments the first commercial application this use quickly became obsolete through the replacement of niobium with tungsten which has a higher melting point that niobium improves the strength of steel was first discovered in the s and this application remains its predominant use in the american physicist eugene kunzler and coworkers at bell labs discovered that niobium tin continues to exhibit superconductivity in the presence of strong electric currents and magnetic fields making it the first material to support the high currents and fields necessary for useful high power magnets and electrical power machinery this discovery enabled two decades later the production of long multi strand cables wound into coils to create large powerful electromagnets for rotating machinery particle accelerators and particle detectors naming the element columbium symbol cb was the name originally given by hatchett upon his discovery of the metal in the name reflected that the type specimen of the ore came from america columbia this name remained in use in american journals the last paper published by american chemical society with columbium in its title dates from while niobium was used in europe to end this confusion the name niobium was chosen for element at the th conference of the union of chemistry in amsterdam in a year later this name was officially adopted by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac after years of controversy despite the chronological precedence of the name columbium this was a compromise of sorts the iupac accepted tungsten instead of wolfram in deference to north american usage and niobium instead of columbium in deference to european usage while many us chemical societies and government organizations typically use the official iupac name some metallurgists and metal societies still use the original american name columbium characteristics physical niobium is a lustrous grey ductile paramagnetic metal in group of the periodic table see table with an electron configuration in the outermost shells atypical for group similary atypical configurations occur in the neighborhood of ruthenium rhodium and palladium although it is thought to have a body centered cubic crystal structure from absolute zero to its melting point high resolution measurements of the thermal expansion along the three crystallographic axes reveal anisotropies which are inconsistent with a cubic structure therefore further research and discovery in this area is expected niobium becomes a superconductor at cryogenic temperatures at atmospheric pressure it has the highest critical temperature of the elemental superconductors at k niobium has the greatest magnetic penetration depth of any element in addition it is one of the three elemental type ii superconductors along with vanadium and technetium the superconductive properties are strongly dependent on the purity of the niobium metal when very pure it is comparatively soft and ductile but impurities make it harder the metal has a low capture cross section for thermal neutrons thus it is used in the nuclear industries where neutron transparent structures are desired chemical the metal takes on a bluish tinge when exposed to air at room temperature for extended periods despite a high melting point in elemental form c it is less dense than other refractory metals furthermore it is corrosion resistant exhibits superconductivity properties and forms dielectric oxide layers niobium is slightly less electropositive and more compact than its predecessor in the periodic table zirconium whereas it is virtually identical in size to the heavier tantalum atoms as a result of the lanthanide contraction as a result niobium s chemical properties are very similar to those for tantalum which appears directly below niobium in the periodic table although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of tantalum the lower price and greater availability make niobium attractive for less demanding applications such as vat linings in chemical plants isotopes niobium in earth s crust comprises one stable isotope nb by at least radioisotopes had been synthesized ranging in atomic mass from to the most stable is nb with half life million years one of the least stable is nb estimated half life milliseconds isotopes lighter than the stable nb tend to decay and those that are heavier tend to decay with some exceptions nb nb and nb have minor delayed proton emission decay paths nb decays by electron capture and positron emission and nb decays by both and decay at least nuclear isomers have been described ranging in atomic mass from to within this range only nb nb and nb do not have isomers the most stable of niobium s isomers is mnb with half life years the least stable isomer is mnb with a half life of ns all of niobium s isomers decay by isomeric transition or beta decay except m nb which has a minor electron capture branch occurrence niobium is estimated to be the th most common element in earth s crust at ppm some believe that the abundance on earth is much greater and that the element s high density has concentrated it in earth s core the free element is not found in nature but niobium occurs in combination with other elements in minerals minerals that contain niobium often also contain tantalum examples include columbite fe mn nb o and columbite tantalite or coltan fe mn ta nb o columbite tantalite minerals the most common species being columbite fe and tantalite fe where fe is the levinson suffix indicating the prevalence of iron over other elements such as manganese that are most usually found as accessory minerals in pegmatite intrusions and in alkaline intrusive rocks less common are the niobates of calcium uranium thorium and the rare earth elements examples of such niobates are pyrochlore na ca nb o oh f now a group name with a relatively common example being e g fluorcalciopyrochlore and euxenite correctly named euxenite y y ca ce u th nb ta ti o these large deposits of niobium have been found associated with carbonatites carbonate silicate igneous rocks and as a constituent of pyrochlore the three largest currently mined deposits of pyrochlore two in brazil and one in canada were found in the s and are still the major producers of niobium mineral

large but still unexploited deposit near s o gabriel da cachoeira state of amazonas as well as a few smaller deposits notably in the state of roraima the third largest producer of niobium is the carbonatite hosted niobec mine in saint honor near chicoutimi quebec canada owned by magris resources it produces between and of the world s supply production after the separation from the other

first industrial scale separation developed by swiss chemist de marignac exploits the differing solubilities of the complex niobium and tantalum fluorides dipotassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate k nbof h o and dipotassium heptafluorotantalate k taf in water newer processes use the liquid extraction of the fluorides from aqueous solution by organic solvents like cyclohexanone the complex

added to enhance the reaction the result is aluminium oxide and ferroniobium an alloy of iron and niobium used in steel production ferroniobium contains between and niobium without iron oxide the aluminothermic process is used to produce niobium further purification is necessary to reach the grade for superconductive alloys electron beam melting under vacuum is the method used by the two major distributors of niobium as of cbmm from brazil controlled percent of the world s niobium production the united states geological survey estimates that the production increased from tonnes in to tonnes in worldwide resources are estimated to be million tonnes during the ten year period between and the production more than doubled starting from tonnes in between and production was stable at tonnes per year with a slight decrease in to only tonnes per year lesser amounts are found in malawi s kanyika deposit kanyika mine compounds in many ways niobium is similar to tantalum and zirconium it reacts with most nonmetals at high temperatures with fluorine at room temperature with chlorine at c and hydrogen at c and with nitrogen at c with products that are frequently interstitial and nonstoichiometric the metal begins to oxidize in air at c it resists corrosion by fused alkalis and by acids including aqua regia hydrochloric sulfuric nitric and phosphoric acids niobium is attacked by hydrofluoric acid and hydrofluoric nitric acid mixtures although niobium exhibits all of the formal oxidation states from to the most common compounds have niobium in the state characteristically compounds in oxidation states less than display nb nb bonding in aqueous solutions niobium only exhibit the oxidation state it is also readily prone to hydrolysis and is barely soluble in dilute solutions of hydrochloric sulfuric nitric and phosphoric acids due to the precipitation of hydrous nb oxide nb v is also slightly soluble in alkaline media due to the formation of soluble polyoxoniobate species oxides niobates and sulfides niobium forms oxides in the oxidation states nb o nbo and the rarer oxidation state nbo most common is the pentoxide precursor to almost all niobium compounds and alloys niobates are generated by dissolving the pentoxide in basic hydroxide solutions or by melting it in alkali metal oxides examples are lithium niobate linbo and lanthanum niobate lanbo in the lithium niobate is a trigonally distorted perovskite like structure whereas the lanthanum niobate contains lone nbo ions the layered niobium sulfide nbs is also known materials can be coated with a thin film of niobium v oxide chemical vapor deposition or atomic layer deposition processes produced by the thermal decomposition of niobium v ethoxide above c halides niobium forms halides in the oxidation states of and as well as diverse substoichiometric compounds the pentahalides nbx feature octahedral nb centres niobium pentafluoride nbf is a white solid with a melting point of c and niobium pentachloride nbcl is yellow see image at left with a melting point of c both are hydrolyzed to give oxides and oxyhalides such as nbocl the pentachloride is a versatile reagent used to generate the organometallic compounds such as niobocene dichloride c h nbcl the tetrahalides nbx are dark coloured polymers with nb nb bonds for example the black hygroscopic niobium tetrafluoride nbf and brown niobium tetrachloride nbcl anionic halide compounds of niobium are well known owing in part to the lewis acidity of the pentahalides the most important is nbf an intermediate in the separation of nb and ta from the ores this heptafluoride tends to form the oxopentafluoride more readily than does the tantalum compound other halide complexes include octahedral nbcl nb cl cl nbcl as with other metals with low atomic numbers a variety of reduced halide cluster ions is known the prime example being nb cl nitrides and carbides other binary compounds of niobium include niobium nitride nbn which becomes a superconductor at low temperatures and is used in detectors for infrared light the main niobium carbide is nbc an extremely hard refractory ceramic material commercially used in cutting tool bits applications out of tonnes of niobium mined in an estimated was used in high grade structural steel the second largest application is superalloys niobium alloy superconductors and electronic components account for a very small share of the world production steel production niobium is an effective microalloying element for steel within which it forms niobium carbide and niobium nitride these compounds improve the grain refining and retard recrystallization and precipitation hardening these effects in turn increase the toughness strength formability and weldability within microalloyed stainless steels the niobium content is a small less than but important addition to high strength low alloy steels that are widely used structurally in modern automobiles niobium is sometimes used in considerably higher quantities for highly wear resistant machine components and knives as high as in crucible cpm s v stainless steel these same niobium alloys are often used in pipeline construction superalloys quantities of niobium are used in nickel cobalt and iron based superalloys in proportions as great as for such applications as jet engine components gas turbines rocket subassemblies turbo charger systems heat resisting and combustion equipment niobium precipitates a hardening phase within the grain structure of the superalloy one example superalloy is inconel consisting of roughly nickel chromium iron niobium molybdenum titanium and aluminium these superalloys were used for example in advanced air frame systems for the gemini program another niobium alloy was used for the nozzle of the apollo service module because niobium is oxidized at temperatures above c a protective coating is necessary for these applications to prevent the alloy from becoming brittle niobium based alloys c alloy was developed in the early s jointly by the wah chang corporation and boeing co dupont union carbide corp general electric co and several other companies were developing nb base alloys simultaneously largely driven by the cold war and space race it is composed of niobium hafnium and titanium and is used for liquid rocket thruster nozzles such as the main engine of the apollo lunar modules the nozzle of the merlin vacuum series of engines developed by spacex for the upper stage of its falcon rocket is made from a niobium alloy the reactivity of niobium with oxygen requires it to be worked in a vacuum or inert atmosphere which significantly increases the cost and difficulty of production vacuum arc remelting var and electron beam melting ebm novel processes at the time enabled the development of niobium and other reactive metals the project that yielded c began in with as many as experimental niobium alloys in the c

estimated tonnes of nb sn strands and tonnes of nbti strands in alone more than us billion worth of clinical magnetic resonance imaging systems were constructed with niobium titanium wire other superconductors the superconducting radio frequency srf cavities used in the free electron lasers flash result of the cancelled tesla linear accelerator project and xfel are made from pure niobium a cryomodule team at fermilab used the same srf technology from the flash project to develop ghz nine cell srf cavities made from pure niobium the cavities will be used in the kilometre mi linear particle accelerator of the international linear collider the same technology will be used in lcls ii at slac national accelerator laboratory and pip ii at fermilab the high sensitivity of superconducting niobium nitride bolometers make them an ideal detector for electromagnetic radiation in the thz frequency band these detectors were tested at the submillimeter telescope the south pole telescope the receiver lab telescope and at apex and are now used in the hifi instrument on board the herschel space observatory other uses electroceramics lithium niobate which is a ferroelectric is used extensively in mobile telephones and optical modulators and for the manufacture of surface acoustic wave devices it belongs to the abo structure ferroelectrics like lithium tantalate and barium titanate niobium capacitors are available as alternative to tantalum capacitors but tantalum capacitors still predominate niobium is added to glass to obtain a higher refractive index making possible thinner and lighter corrective glasses hypoallergenic applications medicine and jewelry niobium and some niobium alloys are physiologically inert and hypoallergenic for this reason niobium is used in prosthetics and implant devices such as pacemakers niobium treated with sodium hydroxide forms a porous layer that aids osseointegration like titanium tantalum and aluminium niobium can be heated and anodized reactive metal anodization to produce a wide array of iridescent colours for jewelry where its hypoallergenic property is highly desirable numismatics niobium is used as a precious metal in

alpine railway commemorative coin and the austrian european satellite navigation commemorative coin the austrian mint produced for latvia a similar series of coins starting in with one following in in the royal canadian mint started production of a sterling silver and niobium coin named hunter s moon in which the niobium was selectively oxidized thus creating unique finishes where no two coins are exactly alike other the arc tube seals of high pressure sodium vapor lamps are made from niobium sometimes alloyed with of zirconium niobium has a very similar coefficient of thermal expansion matching the sintered alumina arc tube ceramic a translucent material which resists chemical attack or reduction by the hot liquid sodium and sodium vapour contained inside the operating lamp niobium

Molybdenum,Mo,molybdenum is a chemical element with the symbol mo and atomic number which is located in period and group the name is from neo latin molybdaenum which is based on ancient greek molybdos meaning lead since its ores were confused with lead ores molybdenum minerals have been known throughout history but the element was discovered in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals in by carl wilhelm scheele the metal was first isolated in by peter jacob hjelm molybdenum does not occur naturally as a free metal on earth it is found only in various oxidation states in minerals the free element a silvery metal with a grey cast has the sixth highest melting point of any element it readily forms hard stable carbides in alloys and for this reason most of the world production of the element about is used in steel alloys including high strength alloys and superalloys most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water but when molybdenum bearing minerals contact oxygen and water the resulting molybdate ion moo is quite soluble industrially molybdenum compounds about of world production of the element are used in high pressure and high temperature applications as pigments and catalysts molybdenum bearing enzymes are by far the most common bacterial catalysts for breaking the chemical bond in atmospheric molecular nitrogen in the process of biological nitrogen fixation at least molybdenum enzymes are now known in bacteria plants and animals although only bacterial and cyanobacterial enzymes are involved in nitrogen fixation these nitrogenases contain an iron molybdenum cofactor femoco which is believed to contain either mo iii or mo iv this is distinct from the fully oxidized mo vi found complexed with molybdopterin in all other molybdenum bearing enzymes which perform a variety of crucial functions the variety of crucial reactions catalyzed by these latter enzymes means that molybdenum is an essential element for all higher eukaryote organisms including humans characteristics physical properties in its pure form molybdenum is a silvery grey metal with a mohs hardness of and a standard atomic weight of g mol it has a melting point of c f of the naturally occurring elements only tantalum osmium rhenium tungsten and carbon have higher melting points it has one of the lowest coefficients of thermal expansion among commercially used metals chemical properties molybdenum is a transition metal with an electronegativity of on the pauling scale it does not visibly react with oxygen or water at room temperature weak oxidation of molybdenum starts at c f bulk oxidation occurs at temperatures above c resulting in molybdenum trioxide like many heavier transition metals molybdenum shows little inclination to form a cation in aqueous solution although the mo cation is known under carefully controlled conditions gaseous molybdenum consists of the diatomic species mo that molecule is a singlet with two unpaired electrons in bonding orbitals in addition to conventional bonds the result is a sextuple bond isotopes there are known isotopes of molybdenum ranging in atomic mass from to as well as four metastable nuclear isomers seven isotopes occur naturally with atomic masses of and of these naturally occurring isotopes only molybdenum is unstable molybdenum is the most abundant isotope comprising of all molybdenum molybdenum has a half life of about y and undergoes double beta decay into ruthenium all unstable isotopes of molybdenum decay into isotopes of niobium technetium and ruthenium of the synthetic radioisotopes the most stable is mo with a half life of years the most common isotopic molybdenum application involves molybdenum which is a fission product it is a parent radioisotope to the short lived gamma emitting daughter radioisotope technetium m a nuclear isomer used in various imaging applications in medicine in the delft university of technology applied for a patent on the molybdenum based production of molybdenum compounds molybdenum forms chemical compounds in oxidation states iv and from ii to vi higher oxidation states are more relevant to its terrestrial occurrence and its biological roles mid level oxidation states are often associated with metal clusters and very low oxidation states are typically associated with organomolybdenum compounds mo and w chemistry shows strong similarities the relative rarity of molybdenum iii for example contrasts with the pervasiveness of the chromium iii compounds the highest oxidation state is seen in molybdenum vi oxide moo whereas the normal sulfur compound is molybdenum disulfide mos from the perspective of commerce the most important compounds are molybdenum disulfide mos and molybdenum trioxide moo the black disulfide is the main mineral it is roasted in air to give the trioxide mos o moo so the trioxide which is volatile at high temperatures is the precursor to virtually all other mo compounds as well as alloys molybdenum has several oxidation states the most stable being and bolded in the table at left molybdenum vi oxide is soluble in strong alkaline water forming molybdates moo molybdates are weaker oxidants than chromates they tend to form structurally complex oxyanions by condensation at lower ph values such as mo o and mo o polymolybdates can incorporate other ions forming polyoxometalates the dark blue phosphorus containing heteropolymolybdate p mo o is used for the spectroscopic detection of phosphorus the broad range of oxidation states of molybdenum is reflected in various molybdenum chlorides molybdenum ii chloride mocl which exists as the hexamer mo cl and the related dianion mo cl molybdenum iii chloride mocl a dark red solid which converts to the anion trianionic complex mocl molybdenum iv chloride mocl a black solid which adopts a polymeric structure molybdenum v chloride mocl dark green solid which adopts a dimeric structure molybdenum vi chloride mocl is a black solid which is monomeric and slowly decomposes to mocl and cl at room temperature like chromium and some other transition metals molybdenum forms quadruple bonds such as in mo ch coo and mo cl the lewis acid properties of the butyrate and perfluorobutyrate dimers mo o cr and rh o cr have been reported the oxidation state and lower are possible with carbon monoxide as ligand such as in molybdenum hexacarbonyl mo co history molybdenite the principal ore from which molybdenum is now extracted was previously known as molybdena molybdena was confused with and often utilized as though it were graphite like graphite molybdenite can be used to blacken a surface or as a solid lubricant even when molybdena was distinguishable from graphite it was still confused with the common lead ore pbs now called galena the name comes from ancient greek molybdos meaning lead the greek word itself has been proposed as a loanword from anatolian luvian and lydian languages although reportedly molybdenum was deliberately alloyed with steel in one th century japanese sword mfd ca that art was never employed widely and was later lost in the west in bengt andersson qvist examined a sample of molybdenite and determined that it did not contain lead and thus was not galena by swedish chemist carl wilhelm scheele stated firmly that molybdena was indeed neither galena nor graphite instead scheele correctly proposed that molybdena was an ore of a distinct new element named molybdenum for the mineral in which it resided and from which it might be isolated peter jacob hjelm successfully isolated molybdenum using carbon and linseed oil in for the next century molybdenum had no industrial use it was relatively scarce the pure metal was difficult to extract and the necessary techniques of metallurgy were immature early molybdenum steel alloys showed great promise of increased hardness but efforts to manufacture the alloys on a large scale were hampered with inconsistent results a tendency toward brittleness and recrystallization in william d coolidge filed a patent for rendering molybdenum ductile leading to applications as a heating element for high temperature furnaces and as a support for tungsten filament light bulbs oxide formation and degradation require that molybdenum be physically sealed or held in an inert gas in frank e elmore developed a froth flotation process to recover molybdenite from ores flotation remains the primary isolation process during world war i demand for molybdenum spiked it was used both in armor plating and as a substitute for tungsten in high speed steels some british tanks were protected by mm in manganese steel plating but this proved to be ineffective the manganese steel plates were replaced with much lighter mm in molybdenum steel plates allowing for higher speed greater maneuverability and better protection the germans also used molybdenum doped steel for heavy artillery like in the super heavy howitzer big bertha because traditional steel melts at the temperatures produced by the propellant of the one ton shell after the war demand plummeted until metallurgical advances allowed extensive development of peacetime applications in world war ii molybdenum again saw strategic importance as a substitute for tungsten in steel alloys occurrence and production molybdenum is the th most abundant element in the earth s crust with an average of parts per million and the th most abundant element in its oceans with an average of parts per billion it is the nd most abundant element in the universe the russian luna mission discovered a molybdenum bearing grain m in a pyroxene fragment taken from mare crisium on the moon the comparative rarity of molybdenum in the earth s crust is offset by its concentration in a number of water insoluble ores often combined with sulfur in the same way as copper with which it is often found though molybdenum is found in such minerals as wulfenite pbmoo and powellite camoo the main commercial source is molybdenite mos molybdenum is mined as a principal ore and is also recovered as a byproduct of copper and tungsten mining the world

concentrated in china mt the us mt and chile mt by continent of world molybdenum production is about evenly shared between north america south america mainly in chile and china europe and the rest of

iron to produce ferromolybdenum a common form of ferromolybdenum contains molybdenum molybdenum had a value of approximately per tonne as of august it maintained a price at or near per tonne from through and reached a peak of per tonne in june in the london metal exchange announced that molybdenum would be traded as a commodity mining historically the knaben mine in southern norway opened in was the first dedicated molybdenum mine it was closed in but was reopened in and now produces kilograms long tons short tons of molybdenum disulfide per year large mines in colorado such as the henderson mine and the climax mine and in british columbia yield molybdenite as their primary product while many porphyry copper deposits such as the bingham canyon mine in utah and the chuquicamata mine in northern chile produce molybdenum as a byproduct of copper mining applications alloys about of molybdenum produced is used in metallurgy with the rest used in chemical applications the estimated global use is structural steel stainless steel chemicals tool high speed steels cast iron molybdenum elemental metal and superalloys molybdenum can withstand extreme temperatures without significantly expanding or softening making it useful in environments of intense heat including military armor aircraft parts electrical contacts industrial motors and supports for filaments in light bulbs most high strength steel alloys for example xx steels contain to molybdenum even in these small portions more than tonnes of molybdenum are used each year in stainless steels tool steels cast irons and high temperature superalloys molybdenum is also valued in steel alloys for its high corrosion resistance and weldability molybdenum contributes corrosion resistance to type stainless steels specifically type and especially so in the so called superaustenitic stainless steels such as alloy al xn smo and hmo molybdenum increases lattice strain thus increasing the energy required to dissolve iron atoms from the surface molybdenum is also used to enhance the corrosion resistance of ferritic for example grade and martensitic for example and stainless steels because of its lower density and more stable price molybdenum is sometimes used in place of tungsten an example is the m series of high speed steels such as m m and m as substitution for the t steel series which contain tungsten molybdenum can also be used as a flame resistant coating for other metals although its melting point is c f molybdenum rapidly oxidizes at temperatures above c f making it better suited for use in vacuum environments tzm mo ti zr and some c is a corrosion resisting molybdenum superalloy that resists molten fluoride salts at temperatures above c f it has about twice the strength of pure mo and is more ductile and more weldable yet in tests it resisted corrosion of a standard eutectic salt flibe and salt vapors used in molten salt reactors for hours with so little corrosion that it was difficult to measure other molybdenum based alloys that do not contain iron have only limited applications for example because of its resistance to molten zinc both pure molybdenum and molybdenum tungsten alloys are used for piping stirrers and pump impellers that come into contact with molten zinc other applications as a pure element molybdenum powder is used as a fertilizer for some plants such as cauliflower elemental molybdenum is used in no no nox analyzers in power plants for pollution controls at c f the element acts as a catalyst for no nox to form no molecules for detection by infrared light molybdenum anodes replace tungsten in certain low voltage x ray sources for specialized uses such as mammography the radioactive isotope molybdenum is used to generate technetium m used for medical imaging the isotope is handled and stored as the molybdate compounds of global use molybdenum disulfide mos is used as a solid lubricant and a high pressure high temperature hpht anti wear agent it forms strong films on metallic surfaces and is a common additive to hpht greases in the event of a catastrophic grease failure a thin layer of molybdenum prevents contact of the lubricated

process of purine catabolism is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase a molybdenum containing enzyme the activity of xanthine oxidase is directly proportional to the amount of molybdenum in the body an extremely high concentration of molybdenum reverses the trend and can inhibit purine catabolism and other processes molybdenum concentration also affects protein synthesis metabolism and growth mo is

retardation infertility low birth weight and gout it can also affect the lungs kidneys and liver sodium tungstate is a competitive inhibitor of molybdenum dietary tungsten reduces the concentration of molybdenum in tissues low soil concentration of molybdenum in a geographical band from northern china to iran results in a general dietary molybdenum deficiency and is associated with increased rates of esophageal cancer compared to the united states which has a greater supply of molybdenum in the soil people living in those areas have about times greater risk for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma molybdenum deficiency has also been reported as a consequence of non molybdenum supplemented total parenteral nutrition complete intravenous feeding for long periods of time it results in high blood levels of sulfite and urate in much the same way as molybdenum cofactor deficiency since pure molybdenum deficiency from this cause occurs primarily in adults the neurological consequences are not as marked as in cases of congenital cofactor deficiency a congenital molybdenum cofactor deficiency disease seen in infants is an inability to synthesize molybdenum cofactor the heterocyclic molecule discussed above that binds molybdenum at the active site in all known human enzymes that use molybdenum the resulting deficiency results in high levels of sulfite and urate and neurological damage excretion most molybdenum is excreted from the human body as molybdate in the urine furthermore urinary excretion of molybdenum increases as dietary molybdenum intake increases small amounts of molybdenum are excreted from the body in the feces by way of the bile small amounts also can be lost in sweat and in hair excess and copper antagonism high levels of molybdenum can interfere with the body s uptake of copper producing copper deficiency molybdenum prevents plasma proteins from binding to copper and it also increases the amount of copper that is excreted in urine ruminants that consume high levels of molybdenum suffer from diarrhea stunted growth anemia and achromotrichia loss of fur pigment these symptoms can be alleviated by copper supplements either dietary and injection the effective copper deficiency can be aggravated by excess sulfur copper reduction or deficiency can also be deliberately induced for therapeutic purposes by the compound ammonium tetrathiomolybdate

as a treatment in wilson s disease a hereditary copper metabolism disorder in humans it acts both by competing with copper absorption in the bowel and by increasing excretion it has also been found to have an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis potentially by inhibiting the membrane translocation process that is dependent on copper ions this is a promising avenue for investigation of treatments for

Technetium,Tc,technetium is a chemical element with the symbol tc and atomic number it is the lightest element whose isotopes are all radioactive all available technetium is produced as a synthetic element naturally occurring technetium is a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore and thorium ore the most common source or the product of neutron capture in molybdenum ores this silvery gray crystalline transition metal lies between manganese and rhenium in group of the periodic table and its chemical properties are intermediate between those of both adjacent elements the most common naturally occurring isotope is tc in traces only many of technetium s properties had been predicted by dmitri mendeleev before it was discovered mendeleev noted a gap in his periodic table and gave the undiscovered element the provisional name ekamanganese em in technetium specifically the technetium isotope became the first predominantly artificial element to be produced hence its name from the greek technetos from techne as in craft art and having the meaning of artificial ium one short lived gamma ray emitting nuclear isomer technetium m is used in nuclear medicine for a wide variety of tests such as bone cancer diagnoses the ground state of the nuclide technetium is used as a gamma ray free source of beta particles long lived technetium isotopes produced commercially are byproducts of the fission of uranium in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods because even the longest lived isotope of technetium has a relatively short half life million years the detection of technetium in red giants helped to prove that stars can produce heavier elements history search for element from the s through early forms of the periodic table proposed by dmitri mendeleev contained a gap between molybdenum element and ruthenium element in mendeleev predicted this missing element would occupy the empty place below manganese and have similar chemical properties mendeleev gave it the provisional name ekamanganese from eka the sanskrit word for one because the predicted element was one place down from the known element manganese early misidentifications many early researchers both before and after the periodic table was published were eager to be the first to discover and name the missing element its location in the table suggested that it should be easier to find than other undiscovered elements irreproducible results german chemists walter noddack otto berg and ida tacke reported the discovery of element and element in and named element masurium after masuria in eastern prussia now in poland the region where walter noddack s family originated the group bombarded columbite with a beam of electrons and deduced element was present by examining x ray emission spectrograms the wavelength of the x rays produced is related to the atomic number by a formula derived by henry moseley in the team claimed to detect a faint x ray signal at a wavelength produced by element later experimenters could not replicate the discovery and it was dismissed as an error for many years still in a series of articles on the discovery of elements quoted the name masurium for element whether the team actually discovered element is still debated official discovery and later history the discovery of element was finally confirmed in a experiment at the university of palermo in sicily by carlo perrier and emilio segr in mid segr visited the united states first columbia university in new york and then the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in california he persuaded cyclotron inventor ernest lawrence to let him take back some discarded cyclotron parts that had become radioactive lawrence mailed him a molybdenum foil that had been part of the deflector in the cyclotron segr enlisted his colleague perrier to attempt to prove through comparative chemistry that the molybdenum activity was indeed from an element with the atomic number in they succeeded in isolating the isotopes technetium m and technetium university of palermo officials wanted them to name their discovery panormium after the latin name for palermo panormus in element was named after the greek word meaning artificial since it was the first element to be artificially produced segr returned to berkeley and met glenn t seaborg they isolated the metastable isotope technetium m which is now used in some ten million medical diagnostic procedures annually in the astronomer paul w merrill in california detected the spectral signature of technetium specifically wavelengths of nm nm nm and nm in light from s type red giants the stars were near the end of their lives but were rich in the short lived element which indicated that it was being produced in the stars by nuclear reactions that evidence bolstered the hypothesis that heavier elements are the product of nucleosynthesis in stars more recently such observations provided evidence that elements are formed by neutron capture in the s process since that discovery there have been many searches in terrestrial materials for natural sources of technetium in technetium was isolated and identified in pitchblende from the belgian congo in extremely small quantities about ng kg where it originates as a spontaneous fission product of uranium the oklo natural nuclear fission reactor contains evidence that significant amounts of technetium were produced and have since decayed into ruthenium characteristics physical properties technetium is a silvery gray radioactive metal with an appearance similar to platinum commonly obtained as a gray powder the crystal structure of the bulk pure metal is hexagonal close packed the crystal structure of the nanodisperse pure metal is cubic nanodisperse technetium does not have a split nmr spectrum while hexagonal bulk technetium has the tc nmr spectrum split in satellites atomic technetium has characteristic emission lines at wavelengths of nm nm nm nm and nm the metal form is slightly paramagnetic meaning its magnetic dipoles align with external magnetic fields but will assume random orientations once the field is removed pure metallic single crystal technetium becomes a type ii superconductor at temperatures below k below this temperature technetium has a very high magnetic penetration depth greater than any other element except niobium chemical properties technetium is located in the seventh group of the periodic table between rhenium and manganese as predicted by the periodic law its chemical properties are between those two elements of the two technetium more closely resembles rhenium particularly in its chemical inertness and tendency to form covalent bonds this is consistent with the tendency of period elements to resemble their counterparts in period more than period due to the lanthanide contraction unlike manganese technetium does not readily form cations ions with a net positive charge technetium exhibits nine oxidation states from to with and being the most common technetium dissolves in aqua regia nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid but it is not soluble in hydrochloric acid of any concentration metallic technetium slowly tarnishes in moist air and in powder form burns in oxygen technetium can catalyse the destruction of hydrazine by nitric acid and this property is due to its multiplicity of valencies this caused a problem in the separation of plutonium from uranium in nuclear fuel processing where hydrazine is used as a protective reductant to keep plutonium in the trivalent rather than the more stable tetravalent state the problem was exacerbated by the mutually enhanced solvent extraction of technetium and zirconium at the previous stage and required a process modification compounds pertechnetate and derivatives the most prevalent form of technetium that is easily accessible is sodium pertechnetate na tco the majority of this material is produced by radioactive decay from moo moo mtco e pertechnetate tetroxidotechnetate tco behaves analogously to perchlorate both of which are tetrahedral unlike permanganate mno it is only a weak oxidizing agent related to pertechnetate is technetium heptoxide this pale yellow volatile solid is produced by oxidation of tc metal and related precursors tc o tc o it is a molecular metal oxide analogous to manganese heptoxide it adopts a centrosymmetric structure with two types of tc o bonds with and pm bond lengths technetium heptoxide hydrolyzes to pertechnetate and pertechnetic acid depending on the ph tc o oh tco h o tc o h o htco htco is a strong acid in concentrated sulfuric acid tco converts to the octahedral form tco oh h o the conjugate base of the hypothetical triaquo complex tco h o other chalcogenide derivatives technetium forms a dioxide disulfide diselenide and ditelluride an ill defined tc s forms upon treating pertechnate with hydrogen sulfide it thermally decomposes into disulfide and elemental sulfur similarly the dioxide can be produced by reduction of the tc o unlike the case for rhenium a trioxide has not been isolated for technetium however tco has been identified in the gas phase using mass spectrometry simple hydride and halide complexes technetium forms the simple complex tch the potassium salt is isostructural with reh the following binary containing only two elements technetium halides are known tcf tcf tccl tcbr tcbr tccl tccl tci tccl and tccl the oxidation states range from tc vi to tc ii technetium halides exhibit different structure types such as molecular octahedral complexes extended chains layered sheets and metal clusters arranged in a three dimensional network these compounds are produced by combining the metal and halogen or by less direct reactions tccl is obtained by chlorination of tc metal or tc o upon heating tccl gives the corresponding tc iii and tc ii chlorides tccl tccl cl tccl tccl cl the structure of tccl is composed of infinite zigzag chains of edge sharing tccl octahedra it is isomorphous to transition metal tetrachlorides of zirconium hafnium and platinum two polymorphs of technetium trichloride exist and tccl the polymorph is also denoted as tc cl it adopts a confacial bioctahedral structure it is prepared by treating the chloro acetate tc o cch cl with hcl like re cl the structure of the polymorph consists of triangles with short m m distances tccl features octahedral tc centers which are organized in pairs as seen also for molybdenum trichloride tcbr does not adopt the structure of either trichloride phase instead it has the structure of molybdenum tribromide consisting of chains of confacial octahedra with alternating short and long tc tc contacts tci has the same structure as the high temperature phase of tii featuring chains of confacial octahedra with equal tc tc contacts several anionic technetium halides are known the binary tetrahalides can be converted to the hexahalides tcx x f cl br i which adopt octahedral molecular geometry more reduced halides form anionic clusters with tc tc bonds the situation is similar for the related elements of mo w re these clusters have the nuclearity tc tc tc and tc the more stable tc and tc clusters have prism shapes where vertical pairs of tc atoms are connected by triple bonds and the planar atoms by single bonds every technetium atom makes six bonds and the remaining valence electrons can be saturated by one axial and two bridging ligand halogen atoms such as chlorine or bromine coordination and organometallic complexes technetium forms a variety of coordination complexes with organic ligands many have been well investigated because of their relevance to nuclear medicine technetium forms a variety of compounds with tc c bonds i e organotechnetium complexes prominent members of this class are complexes with co arene and cyclopentadienyl ligands the binary carbonyl tc co is a white volatile solid in this molecule two technetium atoms are bound to each other each atom is surrounded by octahedra of five carbonyl ligands the bond length between technetium atoms pm is significantly larger than the distance between two atoms in metallic technetium pm similar carbonyls are formed by technetium s congeners manganese and rhenium interest in organotechnetium compounds has also been motivated by applications in nuclear medicine technetium also forms aquo carbonyl complexes one prominent complex being tc co h o which are unusual compared to other metal carbonyls isotopes technetium with atomic number z is the lowest numbered element in the periodic table for which all isotopes are radioactive the second lightest exclusively radioactive element promethium has atomic number atomic nuclei with an odd number of protons are less stable than those with even numbers even when the total number of nucleons protons neutrons is even and odd numbered elements have fewer stable isotopes the most stable radioactive isotopes are technetium with a half life of million years technetium with million years and technetium with years thirty other radioisotopes have been characterized with mass numbers ranging from to most of these have half lives that are less than an hour the exceptions being technetium hours technetium hours technetium hours and technetium days the primary decay mode for isotopes lighter than technetium tc is electron capture producing molybdenum z for technetium and heavier isotopes the primary mode is beta emission the emission of an electron or positron producing ruthenium z with the exception that technetium can decay both by beta emission and electron capture technetium also has numerous nuclear isomers which are isotopes with one or more excited nucleons technetium m mtc m stands for metastability is the most stable with a half life of days and excitation energy mev this is followed by technetium m days mev and technetium m hours mev technetium m emits only gamma rays and decays to technetium technetium tc is a major product of the fission of uranium u making it the most common and most readily available isotope of technetium one gram of technetium produces disintegrations per second in other words the specific activity of tc is gbq g occurrence and production technetium occurs naturally in the earth s crust in minute concentrations of about parts per trillion technetium is so rare because the half lives of tc and tc are only million years more than a thousand of such periods have passed since the formation of the earth so the probability of survival of even one atom of primordial technetium is effectively zero however small amounts exist as spontaneous fission products in uranium ores a kilogram of uranium contains an estimated nanogram g equivalent to ten trillion atoms of technetium some red giant stars with the spectral types s m and n contain a spectral absorption line indicating the presence of technetium these red giants are known informally as technetium stars fission waste product in contrast to the rare natural occurrence bulk quantities of technetium are produced each year from spent nuclear fuel rods which contain various fission products the fission of a gram of uranium in nuclear reactors yields mg of technetium giving technetium a fission product yield of other fissile isotopes produce similar yields of technetium such as from uranium and from plutonium an estimated tbq metric tons of technetium was produced in nuclear reactors between and by far the dominant source of terrestrial technetium only a fraction of the production is used commercially technetium is produced by the nuclear fission of both uranium and plutonium it is therefore present in radioactive waste and in the nuclear fallout of fission bomb explosions its decay measured in becquerels per amount of spent fuel is the dominant contributor to nuclear waste radioactivity after about to years after the creation of the nuclear waste from to an estimated tbq about kg of technetium was released into the environment during atmospheric nuclear tests the amount of technetium from nuclear reactors released into the environment up to is on the order of tbq about kg primarily by nuclear fuel reprocessing most of this was discharged into the sea reprocessing methods have reduced emissions since then but as of the primary release of technetium into the environment is by the sellafield plant which released an estimated tbq about kg from to into the irish sea from onwards the amount has been limited by regulation to tbq about kg per year discharge of technetium into the sea resulted in contamination of some seafood with minuscule quantities of this element for example european lobster and fish from west cumbria contain about bq kg of technetium fission product for commercial use the metastable isotope technetium m is continuously produced as a fission product from the fission of uranium or plutonium in nuclear reactors u sf i y n displaystyle ce u ce sf i y n y s zr s nb s mo h tc y ru displaystyle ce y beta ce s zr beta ce s nb beta ce s mo beta ce h tc beta ce y ru because used fuel is allowed to stand for several years before reprocessing all molybdenum and technetium m is decayed by the time that the fission products are separated from the major actinides in conventional nuclear reprocessing the liquid left after plutonium uranium extraction purex contains a high concentration of technetium as tco but almost all of this is technetium not technetium m the vast majority of the technetium m used in medical work is produced by irradiating dedicated highly enriched uranium targets in a reactor extracting molybdenum from the targets in reprocessing facilities and recovering at the diagnostic center the technetium m produced upon decay of molybdenum molybdenum in the form of molybdate moo is adsorbed onto acid alumina al o in a shielded column chromatograph inside a technetium m generator technetium cow also occasionally called a molybdenum cow molybdenum has a half life of hours so short lived technetium m half life hours which results from its decay is being constantly produced the soluble pertechnetate tco can then be chemically extracted by elution using a saline solution a drawback of this process is that it requires targets containing uranium which are subject to the security precautions of fissile materials almost two thirds of the world s supply comes from two reactors the national research universal reactor at chalk river laboratories in ontario canada and the high flux reactor at nuclear research and consultancy group in petten netherlands all major reactors that produce technetium m were built in the s and are close to the end of life the two new canadian multipurpose applied physics lattice experiment reactors planned and built to produce of the demand of technetium m relieved all other producers from building their own reactors with the cancellation of the already tested reactors in the future supply of technetium m became problematic waste disposal the long half life of technetium and its potential to form anionic species creates a major concern for long term disposal of radioactive waste many of the processes designed to remove fission products in reprocessing plants aim at cationic species such as caesium e g caesium and strontium e g strontium hence the pertechnetate escapes through those processes current disposal options favor burial in continental geologically stable rock the primary danger with such practice is the likelihood that the waste will contact water which could leach radioactive contamination into the environment the anionic pertechnetate and iodide tend not to adsorb into the surfaces of minerals and are likely to be washed away by comparison plutonium uranium and caesium tend to bind to soil particles technetium could be immobilized by some environments such as microbial activity in lake bottom sediments and the environmental chemistry of technetium is an area of active research an alternative disposal method transmutation has been demonstrated at cern for technetium in this process the technetium technetium as a metal target is bombarded with neutrons to form the short lived technetium half life seconds which decays by beta decay to stable ruthenium if recovery of usable ruthenium is a goal an extremely pure technetium target is needed if small traces of the minor actinides such as americium and curium are present in the target they are likely to undergo fission and form more fission products which increase the radioactivity of the irradiated target the formation of ruthenium half life days from the fresh fission is likely to increase the activity of the final ruthenium metal which will then require a longer cooling time after irradiation before the ruthenium can be used the actual separation of technetium from spent nuclear fuel is a long process during fuel reprocessing it comes out as a component of the highly radioactive waste liquid after sitting for several years the radioactivity reduces to a level where extraction of the long lived isotopes including technetium becomes feasible a series of chemical processes yields technetium metal of high purity neutron activation molybdenum which decays to form technetium m can be formed by the neutron activation of molybdenum when needed other technetium isotopes are not produced in significant quantities by fission but are manufactured by neutron irradiation of parent isotopes for example technetium can be made by neutron irradiation of ruthenium particle accelerators the feasibility of technetium m production with the mev proton bombardment of a molybdenum target in medical cyclotrons following the reaction mo p n mtc was demonstrated in the recent shortages of medical technetium m reignited the interest in its production by proton bombardment of isotopically enriched molybdenum targets other techniques are being investigated for obtaining molybdenum from molybdenum via n n or n reactions in particle accelerators applications nuclear medicine and biology technetium m m indicates that this is a metastable nuclear isomer is used in radioactive isotope medical tests for example technetium m is a radioactive tracer that medical imaging equipment tracks in the human body it is well suited to the role because it emits readily detectable kev gamma rays and its half life is hours meaning that about of it decays to technetium in hours the chemistry of technetium allows it to be bound to a variety of biochemical compounds each of which determines how it is metabolized and deposited in the body and this single isotope can be used for a multitude of diagnostic tests more than common radiopharmaceuticals are based on technetium m for imaging and functional studies of the brain heart muscle thyroid lungs liver gall bladder kidneys skeleton blood and tumors the longer lived isotope technetium m with a half life of days is used as a radioactive tracer to study the movement of technetium in the environment and in plant and animal systems industrial and chemical technetium decays almost entirely by beta decay emitting beta particles with consistent low energies and no accompanying gamma rays moreover its long half life means that this emission decreases very slowly with time it can also be extracted to a high chemical and isotopic purity from radioactive waste for these reasons it is a national institute of standards and technology nist standard beta emitter and is used for equipment calibration technetium has also been proposed for optoelectronic devices and nanoscale nuclear batteries like rhenium and palladium technetium can serve as a catalyst in processes such as the dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol it is a far more effective catalyst than either rhenium or palladium however its radioactivity is a major problem in safe catalytic applications when steel is immersed in water adding a small concentration ppm of potassium pertechnetate vii to the water protects the steel from corrosion even if the temperature is raised to c k for this reason pertechnetate has been used as an anodic corrosion inhibitor for steel although technetium s radioactivity poses problems that limit this application to self contained systems while for example cro can also inhibit corrosion it requires a concentration ten times as high in one experiment a specimen of carbon steel was kept in an aqueous solution of pertechnetate for years and was still uncorroded the mechanism by which pertechnetate prevents corrosion is not well understood but seems to involve the reversible formation of a thin surface layer passivation one theory holds that the pertechnetate reacts with the steel surface to form a layer of technetium dioxide which prevents further corrosion the same effect explains how iron powder can be used to remove pertechnetate from water the effect disappears rapidly if the concentration of pertechnetate falls below the minimum concentration or if too high a concentration of other ions is added as noted the radioactive nature of technetium mbq l at the concentrations required makes this corrosion protection impractical in almost all situations nevertheless corrosion protection by pertechnetate ions was proposed but never adopted for use in boiling water reactors precautions technetium plays no natural biological role and is not normally found in the human body technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission and spreads more readily than many radionuclides it appears to have low chemical toxicity for example no significant change in blood formula body and organ weights and food consumption could be detected for rats which ingested up to g of technetium per gram of food for several weeks in the body technetium quickly gets converted to the stable tco ion which is highly water soluble and quickly excreted the radiological toxicity of technetium per unit of mass is a function of compound type of radiation for the isotope in question and the isotope s half life all isotopes of technetium must be handled carefully the most common isotope technetium is a weak beta emitter such radiation is stopped by the walls of laboratory glassware the primary hazard when working with technetium is inhalation of dust such radioactive contamination in the lungs can pose a significant cancer risk for most work careful handling in a fume hood is sufficient and a glove box is not needed ,43
Ruthenium,Ru,ruthenium is a chemical element with the symbol ru and atomic number it is a rare transition metal belonging to the platinum group of the periodic table like the other metals of the platinum group ruthenium is inert to most other chemicals russian born scientist of baltic german ancestry karl ernst claus discovered the element in at kazan state university and named ruthenium in honor of russia ruthenium is usually found as a minor component of platinum ores the annual production has risen from about tonnes in to some tonnes in most ruthenium produced is used in wear resistant electrical contacts and thick film resistors a minor application for ruthenium is in platinum alloys and as a chemistry catalyst a new application of ruthenium is as the capping layer for extreme ultraviolet photomasks ruthenium is generally found in ores with the other platinum group metals in the ural mountains and in north and south america small but commercially important quantities are also found in pentlandite extracted from sudbury ontario and in pyroxenite deposits in south africa characteristics physical properties ruthenium a polyvalent hard white metal is a member of the platinum group and is in group of the periodic table whereas all other group elements have two electrons in the outermost shell in ruthenium the outermost shell has only one electron the final electron is in a lower shell this anomaly is observed in the neighboring metals niobium molybdenum and rhodium chemical properties ruthenium has four crystal modifications and does not tarnish at ambient conditions it oxidizes upon heating to c k ruthenium dissolves in fused alkalis to give ruthenates ruo it is not attacked by acids even aqua regia but is attacked by halogens at high temperatures indeed ruthenium is most readily attacked by oxidizing agents small amounts of ruthenium can increase the hardness of platinum and palladium the corrosion resistance of titanium is increased markedly by the addition of a small amount of ruthenium the metal can be plated by electroplating and by thermal decomposition a ruthenium molybdenum alloy is known to be superconductive at temperatures below k ruthenium is the only d transition metal that can assume the group oxidation state and even then it is less stable there than the heavier congener osmium this is the first group from the left of the table where the second and third row transition metals display notable differences in chemical behavior like iron but unlike osmium ruthenium can form aqueous cations in its lower oxidation states of and ruthenium is the first in a downward trend in the melting and boiling points and atomization enthalpy in the d transition metals after the maximum seen at molybdenum because the d subshell is more than half full and the electrons are contributing less to metallic bonding technetium the previous element has an exceptionally low value that is off the trend due to its half filled kr d s configuration though it is not as far off the trend in the d series as manganese in the d transition series unlike the lighter congener iron ruthenium is paramagnetic at room temperature as iron also is above its curie point the reduction potentials in acidic aqueous solution for some common ruthenium ions are shown below isotopes naturally occurring ruthenium is composed of seven stable isotopes additionally radioactive isotopes have been discovered of these radioisotopes the most stable are ru with a half life of days ru with a half life of days and ru with a half life of days fifteen other radioisotopes have been characterized with atomic weights ranging from u ru to u ru most of these have half lives that are less than five minutes except ru half life hours and ru half life hours the primary decay mode before the most abundant isotope ru is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta emission the primary decay product before ru is technetium and the primary decay product after is rhodium ru is a product of fission of a nucleus of uranium or plutonium high concentrations of detected atmospheric ru were associated with an alleged undeclared nuclear accident in russia in occurrence as the th most abundant element in earth s crust ruthenium is relatively rare found in about parts per trillion this element is generally found in ores with the other platinum group metals in the ural mountains and in north and south america small but commercially important quantities are also found in pentlandite extracted from sudbury ontario canada and in pyroxenite deposits in south africa the native form of ruthenium is a very rare mineral ir replaces part of ru in its structure ruthenium has a relatively high fission product yield in nuclear fission and given that its most long lived radioisotope has a half life of only around a year there are often proposals to recover ruthenium in a new kind of nuclear reprocessing from spent fuel an unusual ruthenium deposit can also be found at the natural nuclear fission reactor that was active in oklo gabon some two billion years ago indeed the isotope ratio of ruthenium found there was one of several ways used to confirm that a nuclear fission chain reaction had indeed occurred at that site in the geological past uranium is no longer mined at oklo and there have never been serious attempts to recover any of the platinum group metals present there production roughly tonnes of ruthenium are mined each year with world reserves estimated at tonnes the composition of the mined platinum group metal pgm mixtures varies widely depending on the geochemical formation for example the pgms mined in south africa contain on average ruthenium while the pgms mined in the former ussr contain only ruthenium osmium and iridium are considered the minor platinum group metals ruthenium like the other platinum group metals is obtained commercially as a by product from nickel and copper and platinum metals ore processing during electrorefining of copper and nickel noble metals such as silver gold and the platinum group metals precipitate as anode mud the feedstock for the extraction the metals are converted to ionized solutes by any of several methods depending on the composition of the feedstock one representative method is fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in aqua regia and solution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid osmium ruthenium rhodium and iridium are insoluble in aqua regia and readily precipitate leaving the other metals in solution rhodium is separated from the residue by treatment with molten sodium bisulfate the insoluble residue containing ru os and ir is treated with sodium oxide in which ir is insoluble producing dissolved ru and os salts after oxidation to the volatile oxides ruo is separated from oso by precipitation of nh rucl with ammonium chloride or by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile osmium tetroxide hydrogen is used to reduce ammonium ruthenium chloride yielding a powder the product is reduced using hydrogen yielding the metal as a powder or sponge metal that can be treated with powder metallurgy techniques or argon arc welding ruthenium is contained in spent nuclear fuel both as a direct fission product and as a product of neutron absorption by long lived fission product tc after allowing the unstable isotopes of ruthenium to decay chemical extraction could yield ruthenium for use or sale in all applications ruthenium is otherwise used for ruthenium can also be produced by deliberate nuclear transmutation from tc given the relatively long half life high fission product yield and high chemical mobility in the environment tc is among the most often proposed non actinides for commercial scale nuclear transmutation tc has a relatively big neutron cross section and given that technetium has no stable isotopes a sample would not run into the problem of neutron activation of stable isotopes significant amounts of tc are produced both by nuclear fission and nuclear medicine which makes ample use of mtc which decays to tc exposing the tc target to strong enough neutron radiation will eventually yield appreciable quantities of ruthenium which can be chemically separated and sold while consuming tc chemical compounds the oxidation states of ruthenium range from to and the properties of ruthenium and osmium compounds are often similar the and states are the most common the most prevalent precursor is ruthenium trichloride a red solid that is poorly defined chemically but versatile synthetically oxides and chalcogenides ruthenium can be oxidized to ruthenium iv oxide ruo oxidation state which can in turn be oxidized by sodium metaperiodate to the volatile yellow tetrahedral ruthenium tetroxide ruo an aggressive strong oxidizing agent with structure and properties analogous to osmium tetroxide ruo is mostly used as an intermediate in the purification of ruthenium from ores and radiowastes dipotassium ruthenate k ruo and potassium perruthenate kruo are also known unlike osmium tetroxide ruthenium tetroxide is less stable is strong enough as an oxidising agent to oxidise dilute hydrochloric acid and organic solvents like ethanol at room temperature and is easily reduced to ruthenate ruo in aqueous alkaline solutions it decomposes to form the dioxide above c unlike iron but like osmium ruthenium does not form oxides in its lower and oxidation states ruthenium forms dichalcogenides which are diamagnetic semiconductors crystallizing in the pyrite structure ruthenium sulfide rus occurs naturally as the mineral laurite like iron ruthenium does not readily form oxoanions and prefers to achieve high coordination numbers with hydroxide ions instead ruthenium tetroxide is reduced by cold dilute potassium hydroxide to form black potassium perruthenate kruo with ruthenium in the oxidation state potassium perruthenate can also be produced by oxidising potassium ruthenate k ruo with chlorine gas the perruthenate ion is unstable and is reduced by water to form the orange ruthenate potassium ruthenate may be synthesized by reacting ruthenium metal with molten potassium hydroxide and potassium nitrate some mixed oxides are also known such as miiruivo na ruvo na ruv o and mii lniiiruvo halides and oxyhalides the highest known ruthenium halide is the hexafluoride a dark brown solid that melts at c it hydrolyzes violently upon contact with water and easily disproportionates to form a mixture of lower ruthenium fluorides releasing fluorine gas ruthenium pentafluoride is a tetrameric dark green solid that is also readily hydrolyzed melting at c the yellow ruthenium tetrafluoride is probably also polymeric and can be formed by reducing the pentafluoride with iodine among the binary compounds of ruthenium these high oxidation states are known only in the oxides and fluorides ruthenium trichloride is a well known compound existing in a black form and a dark brown form the trihydrate is red of the known trihalides trifluoride is dark brown and decomposes above c tribromide is dark brown and decomposes above c and triiodide is black of the dihalides difluoride is not known dichloride is brown dibromide is black and diiodide is blue the only known oxyhalide is the pale green ruthenium vi oxyfluoride ruof coordination and organometallic complexes ruthenium forms a variety of coordination complexes examples are the many pentaammine derivatives ru nh l n that often exist for both ru ii and ru iii derivatives of bipyridine and terpyridine are numerous best known being the luminescent tris bipyridine ruthenium ii chloride ruthenium forms a wide range compounds with carbon ruthenium bonds grubbs catalyst is used for alkene metathesis ruthenocene is analogous to ferrocene structurally but exhibits distinctive redox properties the colorless liquid ruthenium pentacarbonyl converts in the absence of co pressure to the dark red solid triruthenium dodecacarbonyl ruthenium trichloride reacts with carbon monoxide to give many derivatives including ruhcl co pph and ru co pph roper s complex heating solutions of ruthenium trichloride in alcohols with triphenylphosphine gives tris triphenylphosphine ruthenium dichloride rucl pph which converts to the hydride complex chlorohydridotris triphenylphosphine ruthenium ii ruhcl pph history though naturally occurring platinum alloys containing all six platinum group metals were used for a long time by pre columbian americans and known as a material to european chemists from the mid th century not until the mid th century was platinum identified as a pure element that natural platinum contained palladium rhodium osmium and iridium was discovered in the first decade of the th century platinum in alluvial sands of russian rivers gave access to raw material for use in plates and medals and for the minting of ruble coins starting in residues from platinum production for coinage were available in the russian empire and therefore most of the research on them was done in eastern europe it is possible that the polish chemist j drzej niadecki isolated element which he called vestium after the asteroid vesta discovered shortly before from south american platinum ores in he published an announcement of his discovery in his work was never confirmed however and he later withdrew his claim of discovery j ns berzelius and gottfried osann nearly discovered ruthenium in they examined residues that were left after dissolving crude platinum from the ural mountains in aqua regia berzelius did not find any unusual metals but osann thought he found three new metals which he called pluranium ruthenium and polinium this discrepancy led to a long standing controversy between berzelius and osann about the composition of the residues as osann was not able to repeat his isolation of ruthenium he eventually relinquished his claims the name ruthenium was chosen by osann because the analysed samples stemmed from the ural mountains in russia the name itself derives from the latin word ruthenia this word was used at the time as the latin name for russia in karl ernst claus a russian scientist of baltic german descent showed that the compounds prepared by gottfried osann contained small amounts of ruthenium which claus had discovered the same year claus isolated ruthenium from the platinum residues of rouble production while he was working in kazan university kazan the same way its heavier congener osmium had been discovered four decades earlier claus showed that ruthenium oxide contained a new metal and obtained grams of ruthenium from the part of crude platinum that is insoluble in aqua regia choosing the name for the new element claus stated i named the new body in honour of my motherland ruthenium i had every right to call it by this name because mr osann relinquished his ruthenium and the word does not yet exist in chemistry in doing so claus started a trend that continues to this day naming an element after a country applications approximately tonnes of ruthenium were consumed in of them in electrical applications in catalysis and in electrochemistry because it hardens platinum and palladium alloys ruthenium is used in electrical contacts where a thin film is sufficient to achieve the desired durability with its similar properties to and lower cost than rhodium electric contacts are a major use of ruthenium the ruthenium plate is applied to the electrical contact and electrode base metal by electroplating or sputtering ruthenium dioxide with lead and bismuth ruthenates are used in thick film chip resistors these two electronic applications account for of the ruthenium consumption ruthenium is seldom alloyed with metals outside the platinum group where small quantities improve some properties the added corrosion resistance in titanium alloys led to the development of a special alloy with ruthenium ruthenium is also used in some advanced high temperature single crystal superalloys with applications that include the turbines in jet engines several nickel based superalloy compositions are described such as epm with ru tms with ru tms and tms the latter two containing rhenium fountain pen nibs are frequently tipped with ruthenium alloy from onward the parker fountain pen was fitted with the ru nib a k gold nib tipped with ruthenium and iridium ruthenium is a component of mixed metal oxide mmo anodes used for cathodic protection of underground and submerged structures and for electrolytic cells for such processes as generating chlorine from salt water the fluorescence of some ruthenium complexes is quenched by oxygen finding use in optode sensors for oxygen ruthenium red nh ru o ru nh o ru nh is a biological stain used to stain polyanionic molecules such as pectin and nucleic acids for light microscopy and electron microscopy the beta decaying isotope of ruthenium is used in radiotherapy of eye tumors mainly malignant melanomas of the uvea ruthenium centered complexes are being researched for possible anticancer properties compared with platinum complexes those of ruthenium show greater resistance to hydrolysis and more selective action on tumors ruthenium tetroxide exposes latent fingerprints by reacting on contact with fatty oils or fats with sebaceous contaminants and producing brown black ruthenium dioxide pigment electronics electronics is the largest use of ruthenium ru metal is particularly nonvolatile which is advantageous in microelectronic devices ru and its main oxide ruo have comparable electrical resistivities copper can be directly electroplated onto ruthenium particular applications include barrier layers transistor gates and interconnects ru films can be deposited by chemical vapor deposition using volatile complexes such as ruthenium tetroxide and the organoruthenium compound cyclohexadiene ru co catalysis many ruthenium containing compounds exhibit useful catalytic properties the catalysts are conveniently divided into those that are soluble in the reaction medium homogeneous catalysts and those that are not which are called heterogeneous catalysts homogeneous catalysis solutions containing ruthenium trichloride are highly active for olefin metathesis such catalysts are used commercially for the production of polynorbornene for example well defined ruthenium carbene and alkylidene complexes show similar reactivity but are only used on small scale the grubbs catalysts for example have been employed in the preparation of drugs and advanced materials ruthenium complexes are highly active catalysts for transfer hydrogenations sometimes referred to as borrowing hydrogen reactions chiral ruthenium complexes introduced by ryoji noyori are employed for the enantioselective hydrogenation of ketones aldehydes and imines a typical catalyst is cymene ru s s tsdpen a nobel prize in chemistry was awarded in to ry ji noyori for contributions to the field of asymmetric hydrogenation heterogeneous catalysis ruthenium promoted cobalt catalysts are used in fischer tropsch synthesis emerging applications some ruthenium complexes absorb light throughout the visible spectrum and are being actively researched for solar energy technologies for example ruthenium based compounds have been used for light absorption in dye sensitized solar cells a promising new low cost solar cell system many ruthenium based oxides show very unusual properties such as a quantum critical point behavior exotic superconductivity in its strontium ruthenate form and high temperature ferromagnetism health effects little is known about the health effects of ruthenium and it is relatively rare for people to encounter ruthenium compounds metallic ruthenium is inert is not chemically reactive some compounds such as ruthenium oxide ruo are highly toxic and volatile ,44
Rhodium,Rh,rhodium is a chemical element with the symbol rh and atomic number it is a very rare silvery white hard corrosion resistant transition metal it is a noble metal and a member of the platinum group it has only one naturally occurring isotope rh naturally occurring rhodium is usually found as a free metal or as an alloy with similar metals and rarely as a chemical compound in minerals such as bowieite and rhodplumsite it is one of the rarest and most valuable precious metals rhodium is found in platinum or nickel ores with the other members of the platinum group metals it was discovered in by william hyde wollaston in one such ore and named for the rose color of one of its chlorine compounds the element s major use consuming about of world rhodium production is as one of the catalysts in the three way catalytic converters in automobiles because rhodium metal is inert against corrosion and most aggressive chemicals and because of its rarity rhodium is usually alloyed with platinum or palladium and applied in high temperature and corrosion resistive coatings white gold is often plated with a thin rhodium layer to improve its appearance while sterling silver is often rhodium plated to resist tarnishing rhodium is sometimes used to cure silicones a two part silicone in which one part containing a silicon hydride and the other containing a vinyl terminated silicone are mixed one of these liquids contains a rhodium complex rhodium detectors are used in nuclear reactors to measure the neutron flux level other uses of rhodium include asymmetric hydrogenation used to form drug precursors and the processes for the production of acetic acid history rhodium greek rhodon meaning rose was discovered in by william hyde wollaston soon after he discovered palladium he used crude platinum ore presumably obtained from south america his procedure dissolved the ore in aqua regia and neutralized the acid with sodium hydroxide naoh he then precipitated the platinum as ammonium chloroplatinate by adding ammonium chloride nh cl most other metals like copper lead palladium and rhodium were precipitated with zinc diluted nitric acid dissolved all but palladium and rhodium of these palladium dissolved in aqua regia but rhodium did not and the rhodium was precipitated by the addition of sodium chloride as na rhcl nh o after being washed with ethanol the rose red precipitate was reacted with zinc which displaced the rhodium in the ionic compound and thereby released the rhodium as free metal for decades the rare element had only minor applications for example by the turn of the century rhodium containing thermocouples were used to measure temperatures up to c they have exceptionally good stability in the temperature range of to c the first major application was electroplating for decorative uses and as corrosion resistant coating the introduction of the three way catalytic converter by volvo in increased the demand for rhodium the previous catalytic converters used platinum or palladium while the three way catalytic converter used rhodium to reduce the amount of nox in the exhaust characteristics rhodium is a hard silvery durable metal that has a high reflectance rhodium metal does not normally form an oxide even when heated oxygen is absorbed from the atmosphere only at the melting point of rhodium but is released on solidification rhodium has both a higher melting point and lower density than platinum it is not attacked by most acids it is completely insoluble in nitric acid and dissolves slightly in aqua regia chemical properties rhodium belongs to group of the periodic table but the configuration of electrons in the outermost shells is atypical for the group this anomaly is also observed in the neighboring elements niobium ruthenium and palladium the common oxidation state of rhodium is but oxidation states from to are also observed unlike ruthenium and osmium rhodium forms no volatile oxygen compounds the known stable oxides include rh o rho rho xh o na rho sr lirho and sr narho halogen compounds are known in nearly the full range of possible oxidation states rhodium iii chloride rhodium trifluoride rhodium pentafluoride and rhodium hexafluoride are examples the lower oxidation states are stable only in the presence of ligands the best known rhodium halogen compound is the wilkinson s catalyst chlorotris triphenylphosphine rhodium i this catalyst is used in the hydroformylation or hydrogenation of alkenes isotopes naturally occurring rhodium is composed of only one isotope rh the most stable radioisotopes are rh with a half life of years rh with a half life of days mrh with a half life of years and rh with a half life of days twenty other radioisotopes have been characterized with atomic weights ranging from u rh to u rh most of these have half lives shorter than an hour except rh hours and rh hours rhodium has numerous meta states the most stable being mrh mev with a half life of about years and mrh mev with a half life of days see isotopes of rhodium in isotopes weighing less than the stable isotope the primary decay mode is electron capture and the primary decay product is ruthenium in isotopes greater than the primary decay mode is beta emission and the primary product is palladium occurrence rhodium is one of the rarest elements in the earth s crust comprising an estimated parts per million its rarity affects its price and its use in commercial applications the concentration of rhodium in nickel meteorites is typically part per billion rhodium has been measured in some potatoes with concentrations between and ppt mining and price the industrial extraction of rhodium is complex because the ores are mixed with other metals such as palladium silver platinum and gold and there are very few rhodium bearing minerals it is found in platinum ores and extracted as a white inert metal that is difficult to fuse principal sources are located in south africa in river sands of the ural mountains in russia and in north america including the copper nickel sulfide mining area of the sudbury ontario region although the rhodium abundance at sudbury is very small the large amount of processed nickel ore makes rhodium recovery cost effective the main exporter of rhodium is south africa approximately in followed by russia the annual world production is tonnes the price of rhodium is highly variable in rhodium cost approximately eight times more than gold times more than silver and times more than copper by weight in the price briefly rose above per ounce per kilogram the economic slowdown of the rd quarter of pushed rhodium prices sharply back below per ounce per kilogram the price rebounded to by early per kilogram more than twice the gold price but in late the prices were less than political and financial problems led to very low oil prices and over supply causing most metals to drop in price the economies of china india and other emerging countries slowed in and in alone motor vehicles were produced in china excluding motorbikes this resulted in a rhodium price of us per troy ounce grams in late november owners of rhodium a metal with a highly volatile market price are periodically put in an extremely advantageous market position extracting more rhodium containing ore from the ground will necessarily also extract other much more abundant precious metals notably platinum and palladium which would oversupply the market with those other metals lowering their prices since it is economically infeasible to simply extract these other metals just to obtain rhodium the market is often left hopelessly squeezed for rhodium supply causing prices to spike recovery from this supply deficit position may be quite problematic in the future for many reasons notably because it is not known how much rhodium and other precious metals actually was placed in catalytic converters during the many years when manufacturers emissions cheating software was in use much of the world supply of rhodium is obtained from recycled catalytic converters obtained from scrapped vehicles as of early november the spot price of rhodium was us per troy ounce in early march rhodium reached a price of us per troy ounce on metals daily a precious metals commodity listing used nuclear fuels rhodium is a fission product of uranium each kilogram of fission product contains a significant amount of the lighter platinum group metals used nuclear fuel is therefore a potential source of rhodium but the extraction is complex and expensive and the presence of rhodium radioisotopes requires a period of cooling storage for multiple half lives of the longest lived isotope rh with a half life of years and mrh with a half life of years or about years these factors make the source unattractive and no large scale extraction has been attempted applications the primary use of this element is in automobiles as a catalytic converter changing harmful unburned hydrocarbons carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide exhaust emissions into less noxious gases of kg of rhodium consumed worldwide in kg went into this application and kg was recovered from old converters about kg of rhodium was used in the glass industry mostly for production of fiberglass and flat panel glass and kg was used in the chemical industry catalyst rhodium is preferable to the other platinum metals in the reduction of nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and oxygen in net demand with the recycling accounted for of rhodium for automotive converters made up of the world usage with the number fluctuating around during in rhodium catalysts are used in a number of industrial processes notably in catalytic carbonylation of methanol to produce acetic acid by the monsanto process it is also used to catalyze addition of hydrosilanes to molecular double bonds a process important in manufacture of certain silicone rubbers rhodium catalysts are also used to reduce benzene to cyclohexane the complex of a rhodium ion with binap is a widely used chiral catalyst for chiral synthesis as in the synthesis of menthol ornamental uses rhodium finds use in jewelry and for decorations it is electroplated on white gold and platinum to give it a reflective white surface at time of sale after which the thin layer wears away with use this is known as rhodium flashing in the jewelry business it may also be used in coating sterling silver to protect against tarnish silver sulfide ag s produced from atmospheric hydrogen sulfide h s solid pure rhodium jewelry is very rare more because of the difficulty of fabrication high melting point and poor malleability than because of the high price the high cost ensures that rhodium is applied only as an electroplate rhodium has also been used for honors or to signify elite status when more commonly used metals such as silver gold or platinum were deemed insufficient in the guinness book of world records gave paul mccartney a rhodium plated disc for being history s all time best selling songwriter and recording artist other uses rhodium is used as an alloying agent for hardening and improving the corrosion resistance of platinum and palladium these alloys are used in furnace windings bushings for glass fiber production thermocouple elements electrodes for aircraft spark plugs and laboratory crucibles other uses include electrical contacts where it is valued for small electrical resistance small and stable contact resistance and great corrosion resistance rhodium plated by either electroplating or evaporation is extremely hard and useful for optical instruments filters in mammography systems for the characteristic x rays it produces rhodium neutron detectors are used in nuclear reactors to measure neutron flux levels this method requires a digital filter to determine the current neutron flux level generating three separate signals immediate a few seconds delay and a minute delay each with its own signal level all three are combined in the rhodium detector signal the three palo verde nuclear reactors each have rhodium neutron detectors detectors on each of five vertical levels providing an accurate d picture of reactivity and allowing fine tuning to consume the nuclear fuel most economically in automobile manufacturing rhodium is also used in the construction of headlight reflectors precautions being a noble metal pure rhodium is inert and harmless in elemental form however chemical complexes of rhodium can be reactive for rhodium chloride the median lethal dose ld for rats is mg rhcl per kilogram of body weight like the other noble metals rhodium has not been found to serve any biological function people can be exposed to rhodium in the workplace by inhalation the occupational safety and health administration osha has specified the legal limit permissible exposure limit for rhodium exposure in the workplace at mg m over an hour workday and the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set the recommended exposure limit rel at the same level at levels of mg m rhodium is immediately dangerous to life or health for soluble compounds the pel and rel are both mg m ,45
Palladium,Pd,palladium is a chemical element with the symbol pd and atomic number it is a rare and lustrous silvery white metal discovered in by the english chemist william hyde wollaston he named it after the asteroid pallas which was itself named after the epithet of the greek goddess athena acquired by her when she slew pallas palladium platinum rhodium ruthenium iridium and osmium form a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals pgms they have similar chemical properties but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them more than half the supply of palladium and its congener platinum is used in catalytic converters which convert as much as of the harmful gases in automobile exhaust hydrocarbons carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide into nontoxic substances nitrogen carbon dioxide and water vapor palladium is also used in electronics dentistry medicine hydrogen purification chemical applications groundwater treatment and jewelry palladium is a key component of fuel cells in which hydrogen and oxygen react to produce electricity heat and water ore deposits of palladium and other pgms are rare the most extensive deposits have been found in the norite belt of the bushveld igneous complex covering the transvaal basin in south africa the stillwater complex in montana united states the sudbury basin and thunder bay district of ontario canada and the norilsk complex in russia recycling is also a source mostly from scrapped catalytic converters the numerous applications and limited supply sources result in considerable investment interest characteristics palladium belongs to group in the periodic table but the configuration in the outermost electrons is in accordance with hund s rule electrons that by the madelung rule would be expected to occupy the s instead fill the d orbitals as it is more energetically favorable to have a completely filled d shell instead of the s d configuration this s configuration unique in period makes palladium the heaviest element having only one incomplete electron shell with all shells above it empty palladium has the appearance of a soft silver white metal that resembles platinum it is the least dense and has the lowest melting point of the platinum group metals it is soft and ductile when annealed and is greatly increased in strength and hardness when cold worked palladium dissolves slowly in concentrated nitric acid in hot concentrated sulfuric acid and when finely ground in hydrochloric acid it dissolves readily at room temperature in aqua regia palladium does not react with oxygen at standard temperature and thus does not tarnish in air palladium heated to c will produce a layer of palladium ii oxide pdo it may slowly develop a slight brownish coloration over time likely due to the formation of a surface layer of its monoxide palladium films with defects produced by alpha particle bombardment at low temperature exhibit superconductivity having tc k isotopes naturally occurring palladium is composed of seven isotopes six of which are stable the most stable radioisotopes are pd with a half life of million years found in nature pd with days and pd with days eighteen other radioisotopes have been characterized with atomic weights ranging from u pd to u pd these have half lives of less than thirty minutes except pd half life hours pd half life hours and pd half life hours for isotopes with atomic mass unit values less than that of the most abundant stable isotope pd the primary decay mode is electron capture with the primary decay product being rhodium the primary mode of decay for those isotopes of pd with atomic mass greater than is beta decay with the primary product of this decay being silver radiogenic ag is a decay product of pd and was first discovered in in the santa clara meteorite of the discoverers suggest that the coalescence and differentiation of iron cored small planets may have occurred million years after a nucleosynthetic event pd versus ag correlations observed in bodies which have been melted since accretion of the solar system must reflect the presence of short lived nuclides in the early solar system pd is also produced as a fission product in spontaneous or induced fission of u as it is not very mobile in the environment and has a relatively low decay energy pd is usually considered to be among the less concerning of the long lived fission products compounds palladium compounds exist primarily in the and oxidation state other less common states are also recognized generally the compounds of palladium are more similar to those of platinum than those of any other element palladium ii palladium ii chloride is the principal starting material for other palladium compounds it arises by the reaction of palladium with chlorine it is used to prepare heterogeneous palladium catalysts such as palladium on barium sulfate palladium on carbon and palladium chloride on carbon solutions of pdcl in nitric acid react with acetic acid to give palladium ii acetate also a versatile reagent pdcl reacts with ligands l to give square planar complexes of the type pdcl l one example of such complexes is the benzonitrile derivative pdx phcn pdcl l pdcl l l phcn pph nh etc the complex bis triphenylphosphine palladium ii dichloride is a useful catalyst palladium palladium forms a range of zerovalent complexes with the formula pdl pdl and pdl for example reduction of a mixture of pdcl pph and pph gives tetrakis triphenylphosphine palladium pdcl pph pph n h pd pph n n h cl another major palladium complex tris dibenzylideneacetone dipalladium pd dba is prepared by reducing sodium tetrachloropalladate in the presence of dibenzylideneacetone palladium as well as palladium ii are catalysts in coupling reactions as has been recognized by the nobel prize in chemistry to richard f heck ei ichi negishi and akira suzuki such reactions are widely practiced for the synthesis of fine chemicals prominent coupling reactions include the heck suzuki sonogashira coupling stille reactions and the kumada coupling palladium ii acetate tetrakis triphenylphosphine palladium pd pph and tris dibenzylideneacetone dipalladium pd dba serve either as catalysts or precatalysts other oxidation states although pd iv compounds are comparatively rare one example is sodium hexachloropalladate iv na pdcl a few compounds of palladium iii are also known palladium vi was claimed in but subsequently disproven mixed valence palladium complexes exist e g pd co oac pd acac forms an infinite pd chain structure with alternatively interconnected pd co oac and pd acac units when alloyed with a more electropositive element palladium can acquire a negative charge such compounds are known as palladides such as gallium palladide palladides with the stoichiometry rpd exist where r is scandium yttrium or any of the lanthanides occurrence as overall mine production of palladium reached kilograms in russia was the top producer with kilograms followed by south africa canada and the u s russia s company norilsk nickel ranks first among the largest palladium producers globally accounting for of the world s production palladium can be found as a free metal alloyed with gold and other platinum group metals in placer deposits of the ural mountains australia ethiopia north and south america for the production of palladium these deposits play only a minor role the most important commercial sources are nickel copper deposits found in the sudbury basin ontario and the norilsk talnakh deposits in siberia the other large deposit is the merensky reef platinum group metals deposit within the bushveld igneous complex south africa the stillwater igneous complex of montana and the roby zone ore body of the lac des les igneous complex of ontario are the two other sources of palladium in canada and the united states palladium is found in the rare minerals cooperite and polarite many more pd minerals are known but all of them are very rare palladium is also produced in nuclear fission reactors and can be extracted from spent nuclear fuel see synthesis of precious metals though this source for palladium is not used none of the existing nuclear reprocessing facilities are equipped to extract palladium from the high level radioactive waste a complication for the recovery of palladium in spent fuel is the presence of pd a slightly radioactive long lived fission product depending on end use the radioactivity contributed by the pd might make the recovered palladium unusable without a costly step of isotope separation applications the largest use of palladium today is in catalytic converters palladium is also used in jewelry dentistry watch making blood sugar test strips aircraft spark plugs surgical instruments and electrical contacts palladium is also used to make professional transverse concert or classical flutes as a commodity palladium bullion has iso currency codes of xpd and palladium is one of only four metals to have such codes the others being gold silver and platinum because it adsorbs hydrogen palladium was a key component of the controversial cold fusion experiments of the late s catalysis when it is finely divided as with palladium on carbon palladium forms a versatile catalyst it speeds heterogeneous catalytic processes like hydrogenation dehydrogenation and petroleum cracking palladium is also essential to the lindlar catalyst also called lindlar s palladium a large number of carbon carbon bonding reactions in organic chemistry are facilitated by palladium compound catalysts for example heck reaction suzuki coupling tsuji trost reactions wacker process negishi reaction stille coupling sonogashira coupling see palladium compounds and palladium catalyzed coupling reactions when dispersed on conductive materials palladium is an excellent electrocatalyst for oxidation of primary alcohols in alkaline media palladium is also a versatile metal for homogeneous catalysis used in combination with a broad variety of ligands for highly selective chemical transformations in the nobel prize in chemistry was awarded for palladium catalyzed cross couplings in organic synthesis to richard f heck ei ichi negishi and akira suzuki a study showed that palladium is an effective catalyst for carbon fluorine bonds palladium catalysis is primarily employed in organic chemistry and industrial applications although its use is growing as a tool for synthetic biology in effective in vivo catalytic activity of palladium nanoparticles was demonstrated in mammals to treat disease electronics the primary application of palladium in electronics is in multi layer ceramic capacitors in which palladium and palladium silver alloy is used for electrodes palladium sometimes alloyed with nickel is or can be used for component and connector plating in consumer electronics and in soldering materials the electronic sector consumed million troy ounces tonnes of palladium in according to a johnson matthey report technology hydrogen easily diffuses through heated palladium and membrane reactors with pd membranes are used in the production of high purity hydrogen palladium is used in palladium hydrogen electrodes in electrochemical studies palladium ii chloride readily catalyzes carbon monoxide gas to carbon dioxide and is useful in carbon monoxide detectors hydrogen storage palladium readily adsorbs hydrogen at room temperatures forming palladium hydride pdhx with x less than while this property is common to many transition metals palladium has a uniquely high absorption capacity and does not lose its ductility until x approaches this property has been investigated in designing an efficient inexpensive and safe hydrogen fuel storage medium though palladium itself is currently prohibitively expensive for this purpose the content of hydrogen in palladium can be linked to magnetic susceptibility which decreases with the increase of hydrogen and becomes zero for pdh at any higher ratio the solid solution becomes diamagnetic palladium is also used for hydrogen purification via hydrogen purification membranes dentistry palladium is used in small amounts about in some alloys of dental amalgam to decrease corrosion and increase the metallic lustre of the final restoration jewelry palladium has been used as a precious metal in jewelry since as an alternative to platinum in the alloys called white gold where the naturally white color of palladium does not require rhodium plating palladium is much less dense than platinum similar to gold palladium can be beaten into leaf as thin as nm in unlike platinum palladium may discolor at temperatures above c f due to oxidation making it more brittle and thus less suitable for use in jewelry to prevent this palladium intended for jewelry is heated under controlled conditions prior to the principal use of palladium in jewelry was the manufacture of white gold palladium is one of the three most popular alloying metals in white gold nickel and silver can also be used palladium gold is more expensive than nickel gold but seldom causes allergic reactions though certain cross allergies with nickel may occur when platinum became a strategic resource during world war ii many jewelry bands were made out of palladium palladium was little used in jewelry because of the technical difficulty of casting with the casting problem resolved the use of palladium in jewelry increased originally because platinum increased in price while the price of palladium decreased in early when gold and platinum prices rose steeply china began fabricating volumes of palladium jewelry consuming tonnes in subsequent changes in the relative price of platinum lowered demand for palladium to tonnes in demand for palladium as a catalyst has increased the price of palladium to about higher than that of platinum in january in january hallmarks for palladium were introduced by assay offices in the united kingdom and hallmarking became mandatory for all jewelry advertising pure or alloyed palladium articles can be marked as or parts of palladium per thousand of the alloy fountain pen nibs made from gold are sometimes plated with palladium when a silver rather than gold appearance is desired sheaffer has used palladium plating for decades either as an accent on otherwise gold nibs or covering the gold completely palladium is also used by the luxury brand hermes as one of the metals plating the hardware on their handbags most famous of which being the highly sought after birkin photography in the platinotype printing process photographers make fine art black and white prints using platinum or palladium salts often used with platinum palladium provides an alternative to silver effects on health toxicity palladium is a metal with low toxicity as conventionally measured e g ld recent research on the mechanism of palladium toxicity suggests high toxicity if measured on a longer timeframe and at the cellular level in the liver and kidney mitochondria appear to have a key role in palladium toxicity via mitochondrial membrane potential collapse and depletion of the cellular glutathione gsh level until that recent work it had been thought that palladium was poorly absorbed by the human body when ingested plants such as the water hyacinth are killed by low levels of palladium salts but most other plants tolerate it although tests show that at levels above growth is affected high doses of palladium could be poisonous tests on rodents suggest it may be carcinogenic though until the recent research cited above no clear evidence indicated that the element harms humans precautions like other platinum group metals bulk pd is quite inert although contact dermatitis has been reported data on the effects are limited it has been shown that people with an allergic reaction to palladium also react to nickel making it advisable to avoid the use of dental alloys containing palladium on those so allergic some palladium is emitted with the exhaust gases of cars with catalytic converters between and ng km of palladium particulate is released by such cars while the total uptake from food is estimated to be less than g per person a day the second possible source of palladium is dental restoration from which the uptake of palladium is estimated to be less than g per person per day people working with palladium or its compounds might have a considerably greater uptake for soluble compounds such as palladium chloride is eliminated from the body within days the median lethal dose ld of soluble palladium compounds in mice is mg kg for oral and mg kg for intravenous administration history william hyde wollaston noted the discovery of a new noble metal in july in his lab book and named it palladium in august of the same year wollaston purified a quantity of the material and offered it without naming the discoverer in a small shop in soho in april after harsh criticism from richard chenevix who claimed that palladium was an alloy of platinum and mercury wollaston anonymously offered a reward of for grains of synthetic palladium alloy chenevix received the copley medal in after he published his experiments on palladium wollaston published the discovery of rhodium in and mentions some of his work on palladium he disclosed that he was the discoverer of palladium in a publication in it was named by wollaston in after the asteroid pallas which had been discovered two months earlier wollaston found palladium in crude platinum ore from south america by dissolving the ore in aqua regia neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide and precipitating platinum as ammonium chloroplatinate with ammonium chloride he added mercuric cyanide to form the compound palladium ii cyanide which was heated to extract palladium metal palladium chloride was at one time prescribed as a tuberculosis treatment at the rate of g per day approximately one milligram per kilogram of body weight this treatment had many negative side effects and was later replaced by more effective drugs most palladium is used for catalytic converters in the automobile industry catalytic converters are targets for thieves because they contain palladium and other rare metals in the run up to year the russian supply of palladium to the global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted for political reasons the export quota was not granted on time the ensuing market panic drove the price to an all time high of per troy ounce g in january around that time the ford motor company fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a palladium shortage stockpiled the metal when prices fell in early ford lost nearly us billion world demand for palladium increased from tons in to nearly tons in the global production of palladium from mines was tonnes in according to the united states geological survey many were concerned about a steady supply of palladium in the wake of russia s annexation of crimea partly as sanctions could hamper russian palladium exports any restrictions on russian palladium exports could have exacerbated what was already expected to be a large palladium deficit in those concerns pushed palladium prices to their highest level since in september they soared above the per ounce mark in however palladium cost around per ounce as russia managed to maintain stable supplies in january palladium futures climbed past per ounce for the first time on record mainly due to the strong demand from the automotive industry palladium reached per troy ounce g on january passing per troy ounce the first time the price rose above per troy ounce in may and march palladium as investment global palladium sales were million ounces tonnes in of which was used in the manufacturing of automotive catalytic converters followed by industrial jewelry and investment usages more than of global platinum and of palladium are mined in south africa russia s mining company norilsk nickel produces another of palladium with us and canada based mines producing most of the rest the price for palladium reached an all time high of per ounce on may driven mainly on speculation of the catalytic converter demand from the automobile industry palladium is traded in the spot market with the code xpd when settled in usd the code is xpdusd a later surplus of the metal was caused by the russian government selling stockpiles from the soviet era at a rate of about to million ounces to t a year the amount and status of this stockpile are a state secret during the russo ukrainian war in march prices for palladium increased since the first of

Silver,Ag,silver is a chemical element with the symbol ag from the latin argentum derived from the proto indo european h er shiny or white and atomic number a soft white lustrous transition metal it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity thermal conductivity and reflectivity of any metal the metal is found in the earth s crust in the pure free elemental form native silver as an alloy with gold and other metals and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper gold lead and zinc refining silver has long been valued as a precious metal silver metal is used in many bullion coins sometimes alongside gold while it is more abundant than gold it is much less abundant as a native metal its purity is typically measured on a per mille basis a pure alloy is described as fine as one of the seven metals of antiquity silver has had an enduring role in most human cultures other than in currency and as an investment medium coins and bullion silver is used in solar panels water filtration jewellery ornaments high value tableware and utensils hence the term silverware in electrical contacts and conductors in specialized mirrors window coatings in catalysis of chemical reactions as a colorant in stained glass and in specialized confectionery its compounds are used in photographic and x ray film dilute solutions of silver nitrate and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants and microbiocides oligodynamic effect added to bandages wound dressings catheters and other medical instruments characteristics silver is similar in its physical and chemical properties to its two vertical neighbours in group of the periodic table copper and gold its electrons are arranged in the configuration kr d s similarly to copper ar d s and gold xe f d s group is one of the few groups in the d block which has a completely consistent set of electron configurations this distinctive electron configuration with a single electron in the highest occupied s subshell over a filled d subshell accounts for many of the singular properties of metallic silver silver is a relatively soft and extremely ductile and malleable transition metal though it is slightly less malleable than gold silver crystallizes in a face centered cubic lattice with bulk coordination number where only the single s electron is delocalized similarly to copper and gold unlike metals with incomplete d shells metallic bonds in silver are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak this observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of silver silver has a brilliant white metallic luster that can take a high polish and which is so characteristic that the name of the metal itself has become a colour name unlike copper and gold the energy required to excite an electron from the filled d band to the s p conduction band in silver is large enough around kj mol that it no longer corresponds to absorption in the visible region of the spectrum but rather in the ultraviolet hence silver is not a coloured metal protected silver has greater optical reflectivity than aluminium at all wavelengths longer than nm at wavelengths shorter than nm silver s reflectivity is inferior to that of aluminium and drops to zero near nm very high electrical and thermal conductivity are common to the elements in group because their single s electron is free and does not interact with the filled d subshell as such interactions which occur in the preceding transition metals lower electron mobility the thermal conductivity of silver is among the highest of all materials although the thermal conductivity of carbon in the diamond allotrope and superfluid helium are higher the electrical conductivity of silver is the highest of all metals greater even than copper silver also has the lowest contact resistance of any metal silver is rarely used for its electrical conductivity due to its high cost although an exception is in radio frequency engineering particularly at vhf and higher frequencies where silver plating improves electrical conductivity because those currents tend to flow on the surface of conductors rather than through the interior during world war ii in the us tons of silver were used for the electromagnets in calutrons for enriching uranium mainly because of the wartime shortage of copper silver readily forms alloys with copper gold and zinc zinc silver alloys with low zinc concentration may be considered as face centred cubic solid solutions of zinc in silver as the structure of the silver is largely unchanged while the electron concentration rises as more zinc is added increasing the electron concentration further leads to body centred cubic electron concentration complex cubic and hexagonal close packed phases isotopes naturally occurring silver is composed of two stable isotopes ag and ag with ag being slightly more abundant natural abundance this almost equal abundance is rare in the periodic table the atomic weight is u this value is very important because of the importance of silver compounds particularly halides in gravimetric analysis both isotopes of silver are produced in stars via the s process slow neutron capture as well as in supernovas via the r process rapid neutron capture twenty eight radioisotopes have been characterized the most stable being ag with a half life of days ag with a half life of days and ag with a half life of hours silver has numerous nuclear isomers the most stable being mag t years mag t days and mag t days all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives of less than an hour and the majority of these have half lives of less than three minutes isotopes of silver range in relative atomic mass from u ag to u ag the primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope ag is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta decay the primary decay products before ag are palladium element isotopes and the primary products after are cadmium element isotopes the palladium isotope pd decays by beta emission to ag with a half life of million years iron meteorites are the only objects with a high enough palladium to silver ratio to yield measurable variations in ag abundance radiogenic ag was first discovered in the santa clara meteorite in pd ag correlations observed in bodies that have clearly been melted since the accretion of the solar system must reflect the presence of unstable nuclides in the early solar system chemistry silver is a rather unreactive metal this is because its filled d shell is not very effective in shielding the electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus to the outermost s electron and hence silver is near the bottom of the electrochemical series e ag ag v in group silver has the lowest first ionization energy showing the instability of the s orbital but has higher second and third ionization energies than copper and gold showing the stability of the d orbitals so that the chemistry of silver is predominantly that of the oxidation state reflecting the increasingly limited range of oxidation states along the transition series as the d orbitals fill and stabilize unlike copper for which the larger hydration energy of cu as compared to cu is the reason why the former is the more stable in aqueous solution and solids despite lacking the stable filled d subshell of the latter with silver this effect is swamped by its larger second ionisation energy hence ag is the stable species in aqueous solution and solids with ag being much less stable as it oxidizes water most silver compounds have significant covalent character due to the small size and high first ionization energy kj mol of silver furthermore silver s pauling electronegativity of is higher than that of lead and its electron affinity of kj mol is much higher than that of hydrogen kj mol and not much less than that of oxygen kj mol due to its full d subshell silver in its main oxidation state exhibits relatively few properties of the transition metals proper from groups to forming rather unstable organometallic compounds forming linear complexes showing very low coordination numbers like and forming an amphoteric oxide as well as zintl phases like the post transition metals unlike the preceding transition metals the oxidation state of silver is stable even in the absence of acceptor ligands silver does not react with air even at red heat and thus was considered by alchemists as a noble metal along with gold its reactivity is intermediate between that of copper which forms copper i oxide when heated in air to red heat and gold like copper silver reacts with sulfur and its compounds in their presence silver tarnishes in air to form the black silver sulfide copper forms the green sulfate instead while gold does not react unlike copper silver will not react with the halogens with the exception of fluorine gas with which it forms the difluoride while silver is not attacked by non oxidizing acids the metal dissolves readily in hot concentrated sulfuric acid as well as dilute or concentrated nitric acid in the presence of air and especially in the presence of hydrogen peroxide silver dissolves readily in aqueous solutions of cyanide the three main forms of deterioration in historical silver artifacts are tarnishing formation of silver chloride due to long term immersion in salt water as well as reaction with nitrate ions or oxygen fresh silver chloride is pale yellow becoming purplish on exposure to light it projects slightly from the surface of the artifact or coin the precipitation of copper in ancient silver can be used to date artifacts as copper is nearly always a constituent of silver alloys silver metal is attacked by strong oxidizers such as potassium permanganate kmno and potassium dichromate k cr o and in the presence of potassium bromide kbr these compounds are used in photography to bleach silver images converting them to silver bromide that can either be fixed with thiosulfate or redeveloped to intensify the original image silver forms cyanide complexes silver cyanide that are soluble in water in the presence of an excess of cyanide ions silver cyanide solutions are used in electroplating of silver the common oxidation states of silver are in order of commonness the most stable state for example silver nitrate agno highly oxidising for example silver ii fluoride agf and even very rarely extreme oxidising for example potassium tetrafluoroargentate iii kagf the state requires very strong oxidising agents to attain such as fluorine or peroxodisulfate and some silver iii compounds react with atmospheric moisture and attack glass indeed silver iii fluoride is usually obtained by reacting silver or silver monofluoride with the strongest known oxidizing agent krypton difluoride compounds oxides and chalcogenides silver and gold have rather low chemical affinities for oxygen lower than copper and it is therefore expected that silver oxides are thermally quite unstable soluble silver i salts precipitate dark brown silver i oxide ag o upon the addition of alkali the hydroxide agoh exists only in solution otherwise it spontaneously decomposes to the oxide silver i oxide is very easily reduced to metallic silver and decomposes to silver and oxygen above c this and other silver i compounds may be oxidized by the strong oxidizing agent peroxodisulfate to black ago a mixed silver i iii oxide of formula agiagiiio some other mixed oxides with silver in non integral oxidation states namely ag o and ag o are also known as is ag o which behaves as a metallic conductor silver i sulfide ag s is very readily formed from its constituent elements and is the cause of the black tarnish on some old silver objects it may also be formed from the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with silver metal or aqueous ag ions many non stoichiometric selenides and tellurides are known in particular agte is a low temperature superconductor halides the only known dihalide of silver is the difluoride agf which can be obtained from the elements under heat a strong yet thermally stable and therefore safe fluorinating agent silver ii fluoride is often used to synthesize hydrofluorocarbons in stark contrast to this all four silver i halides are known the fluoride chloride and bromide have the sodium chloride structure but the iodide has three known stable forms at different temperatures that at room temperature is the cubic zinc blende structure they can all be obtained by the direct reaction of their respective elements as the halogen group is descended the silver halide gains more and more covalent character solubility decreases and the color changes from the white chloride to the yellow iodide as the energy required for ligand metal charge transfer x ag xag decreases the fluoride is anomalous as the fluoride ion is so small that it has a considerable solvation energy and hence is highly water soluble and forms di and tetrahydrates the other three silver halides are highly insoluble in aqueous solutions and are very commonly used in gravimetric analytical methods all four are photosensitive though the monofluoride is so only to ultraviolet light especially the bromide and iodide which photodecompose to silver metal and thus were used in traditional photography the reaction involved is x h x e excitation of the halide ion which gives up its extra electron into the conduction band ag e ag liberation of a silver ion which gains an electron to become a silver atom the process is not reversible because the silver atom liberated is typically found at a crystal defect or an impurity site so that the electron s energy is lowered enough that it is trapped other inorganic compounds white silver nitrate agno is a versatile precursor to many other silver compounds especially the halides and is much less sensitive to light it was once called lunar caustic because silver was called luna by the ancient alchemists who believed that silver was associated with the moon it is often used for gravimetric analysis exploiting the insolubility of the heavier silver halides which it is a common precursor to silver nitrate is used in many ways in organic synthesis e g for deprotection and oxidations ag binds alkenes reversibly and silver nitrate has been used to separate mixtures of alkenes by selective absorption the resulting adduct can be decomposed with ammonia to release the free alkene yellow silver carbonate ag co can be easily prepared by reacting aqueous solutions of sodium carbonate with a deficiency of silver nitrate its principal use is for the production of silver powder for use in microelectronics it is reduced with formaldehyde producing silver free of alkali metals ag co ch o ag co h silver carbonate is also used as a reagent in organic synthesis such as the koenigs knorr reaction in the f tizon oxidation silver carbonate on celite acts as an oxidising agent to form lactones from diols it is also employed to convert alkyl bromides into alcohols silver fulminate agcno a powerful touch sensitive explosive used in percussion caps is made by reaction of silver metal with nitric acid in the presence of ethanol other dangerously explosive silver compounds are silver azide agn formed by reaction of silver nitrate with sodium azide and silver acetylide ag c formed when silver reacts with acetylene gas in ammonia solution in its most characteristic reaction silver azide decomposes explosively releasing nitrogen gas given the photosensitivity of silver salts this behaviour may be induced by shining a light on its crystals agn s n g ag s coordination compounds silver complexes tend to be similar to those of its lighter homologue copper silver iii complexes tend to be rare and very easily reduced to the more stable lower oxidation states though they are slightly more stable than those of copper iii for instance the square planar periodate ag io oh and tellurate ag teo oh complexes may be prepared by oxidising silver i with alkaline peroxodisulfate the yellow diamagnetic agf is much less stable fuming in moist air and reacting with glass silver ii complexes are more common like the valence isoelectronic copper ii complexes they are usually square planar and paramagnetic which is increased by the greater field splitting for d electrons than for d electrons aqueous ag produced by oxidation of ag by ozone is a very strong oxidising agent even in acidic solutions it is stabilized in phosphoric acid due to complex formation peroxodisulfate oxidation is generally necessary to give the more stable complexes with heterocyclic amines such as ag py and ag bipy these are stable provided the counterion cannot reduce the silver back to the oxidation state agf is also known in its violet barium salt as are some silver ii complexes with n or o donor ligands such as pyridine carboxylates by far the most important oxidation state for silver in complexes is the ag cation is diamagnetic like its homologues cu and au as all three have closed shell electron configurations with no unpaired electrons its complexes are colourless provided the ligands are not too easily polarized such as i ag forms salts with most anions but it is reluctant to coordinate to oxygen and thus most of these salts are insoluble in water the exceptions are the nitrate perchlorate and fluoride the tetracoordinate tetrahedral aqueous ion ag h o is known but the characteristic geometry for the ag cation is coordinate linear for example silver chloride dissolves readily in excess aqueous ammonia to form ag nh silver salts are dissolved in photography due to the formation of the thiosulfate complex ag s o and cyanide extraction for silver and gold works by the formation of the complex ag cn silver cyanide forms the linear polymer ag c n ag c n silver thiocyanate has a similar structure but forms a zigzag instead because of the sp hybridized sulfur atom chelating ligands are unable to form linear complexes and thus silver i complexes with them tend to form polymers a few exceptions exist such as the near tetrahedral diphosphine and diarsine complexes ag l l organometallic under standard conditions silver does not form simple carbonyls due to the weakness of the ag c bond a few are known at very low temperatures around k such as the green planar paramagnetic ag co which dimerizes at k probably by forming ag ag bonds additionally the silver carbonyl ag co b otef is known polymeric aglx complexes with alkenes and alkynes are known but their bonds are thermodynamically weaker than even those of the platinum complexes though they are formed more readily than those of the analogous gold complexes they are also quite unsymmetrical showing the weak bonding in group ag c bonds may also be formed by silver i like copper i and gold i but the simple alkyls and aryls of silver i are even less stable than those of copper i which tend to explode under ambient conditions for example poor thermal stability is reflected in the relative decomposition temperatures of agme c and cume c as well as those of phag c and phcu c the c ag bond is stabilized by perfluoroalkyl ligands for example in agcf cf alkenylsilver compounds are also more stable than their alkylsilver counterparts silver nhc complexes are easily prepared and are commonly used to prepare other nhc complexes by displacing labile ligands for example the reaction of the bis nhc silver i complex with bis acetonitrile palladium dichloride or chlorido dimethyl sulfide gold i intermetallic silver forms alloys with most other elements on the periodic table the elements from groups except for hydrogen lithium and beryllium are very miscible with silver in the condensed phase and form intermetallic compounds those from groups are only poorly miscible the elements in groups except boron and carbon have very complex ag m phase diagrams and form the most commercially important alloys and the remaining elements on the periodic table have no consistency in their ag m phase diagrams by far the most important such alloys are those with copper most silver used for coinage and jewellery is in reality a silver copper alloy and the eutectic mixture is used in vacuum brazing the two metals are completely miscible as liquids but not as solids their importance in industry comes from the fact that their properties tend to be suitable over a wide range of variation in silver and copper concentration although most useful alloys tend to be richer in silver than the eutectic mixture silver and copper by weight and silver and copper by atom most other binary alloys are of little use for example silver gold alloys are too soft and silver cadmium alloys too toxic ternary alloys have much greater importance dental amalgams are usually silver tin mercury alloys silver copper gold alloys are very important in jewellery usually on the gold rich side and have a vast range of hardnesses and colours silver copper zinc alloys are useful as low melting brazing alloys and silver cadmium indium involving three adjacent elements on the periodic table is useful in nuclear reactors because of its high thermal neutron capture cross section good conduction of heat mechanical stability and resistance to corrosion in hot water etymology the word silver appears in old english in various spellings such as seolfor and siolfor it is cognate with old high german silabar gothic silubr or old norse silfr all ultimately deriving from proto germanic silubra the balto slavic words for silver are rather similar to the germanic ones e g russian serebr polish srebro lithuanian sid bras as is the celtiberian form silabur they may have a common indo european origin although their morphology rather suggest a non indo european wanderwort some scholars have thus proposed a paleo hispanic origin pointing to the basque form zilharr as an evidence the chemical symbol ag is from the latin word for silver argentum compare ancient greek rgyros from the proto indo european root h er formerly reconstructed as ar meaning white or shining this was the usual proto indo european word for the metal whose reflexes are missing in germanic and balto slavic history silver was one of the seven metals of antiquity that were known to prehistoric humans and whose discovery is thus lost to history in particular the three metals of group copper silver and gold occur in the elemental form in nature and were probably used as the first primitive forms of money as opposed to simple bartering however unlike copper silver did not lead to the growth of metallurgy on account of its low structural strength and was more often used ornamentally or as money since silver is more reactive than gold supplies of native silver were much more limited than those of gold for example silver was more expensive than gold in egypt until around the fifteenth century bc the egyptians are thought to have separated gold from silver by heating the metals with salt and then reducing the silver chloride produced to the metal the situation changed with the discovery of cupellation a technique that allowed silver metal to be extracted from its ores while slag heaps found in asia minor and on the islands of the aegean sea indicate that silver was being separated from lead as early as the th millennium bc and one of the earliest silver extraction centres in europe was sardinia in the early chalcolithic period these techniques did not spread widely until later when it spread throughout the region and beyond the origins of silver production in india china and japan were almost certainly equally ancient but are not well documented due to their great age when the phoenicians first came to what is now spain they obtained so much silver that they could not fit it all on their ships and as a result used silver to weight their anchors instead of lead by the time of the greek and roman civilizations silver coins were a staple of the economy the greeks were already extracting silver from galena by the th century bc and the rise of athens was partly made possible by the nearby silver mines at laurium from which they extracted about tonnes a year from to bc the stability of the roman currency relied to a high degree on the supply of silver bullion mostly from spain which roman miners produced on a scale unparalleled before the discovery of the new world reaching a peak production of tonnes per year an estimated silver stock of tonnes circulated in the roman economy in the middle of the second century ad five to ten times larger than the combined amount of silver available to medieval europe and the abbasid caliphate around ad the romans also recorded the extraction of silver in central and northern europe in the same time period this production came to a nearly complete halt with the fall of the roman empire not to resume until the time of charlemagne by then tens of thousands of tonnes of silver had already been extracted central europe became the centre of silver production during the middle ages as the mediterranean deposits exploited by the ancient civilisations had been exhausted silver mines were opened in bohemia saxony erzgebirge alsace the lahn region siegerland silesia hungary norway steiermark salzburg and the southern black forest most of these ores were quite rich in silver and could simply be separated by hand from the remaining rock and then smelted some deposits of native silver were also encountered many of these mines were soon exhausted but a few of them remained active until the industrial revolution before which the world production of silver was around a meagre tonnes per year in the americas high temperature silver lead cupellation technology was developed by pre inca civilizations as early as ad silver deposits in india china japan and pre columbian america continued to be mined during this time with the discovery of america and the plundering of silver by the spanish conquistadors central and south america became the dominant producers of silver until around the beginning of the th century particularly peru bolivia chile and argentina the last of these countries later took its name from that of the metal that composed so much of its mineral wealth the silver trade gave way to a global network of exchange as one historian put it silver went round the world and made the world go round much of this silver ended up in the hands of the chinese a portuguese merchant in noted that silver wanders throughout all the world before flocking to china where it remains as if at its natural center still much of it went to spain allowing spanish rulers to pursue military and political ambitions in both europe and the americas new world mines concluded several historians supported the spanish empire in the th century primary production of silver moved to north america particularly canada mexico and nevada in the united states some secondary production from lead and zinc ores also took place in europe and deposits in siberia and the russian far east as well as in australia were mined poland emerged as an important producer during the s after the discovery of copper deposits that were rich in silver before the centre of production returned to the americas the following decade today peru and mexico are still among the primary silver producers but the distribution of silver production around the world is quite balanced and about one fifth of the silver supply comes from recycling instead of new production symbolic role silver plays a certain role in mythology and has found various usage as a metaphor and in folklore the greek poet hesiod s works and days lines lists different ages of man named after metals like gold silver bronze and iron to account for successive ages of humanity ovid s metamorphoses contains another retelling of the story containing an illustration of silver s metaphorical use of signifying the second best in a series better than bronze but worse than gold in folklore silver was commonly thought to have mystic powers for example a bullet cast from silver is often supposed in such folklore the only weapon that is effective against a werewolf witch or other monsters from this the idiom of a silver bullet developed into figuratively referring to any simple solution with very high effectiveness or almost miraculous results as in the widely discussed software engineering paper no silver bullet other powers attributed to silver include detection of poison and facilitation of passage into the mythical realm of fairies silver production has also inspired figurative language clear references to cupellation occur throughout the old testament of the bible such as in jeremiah s rebuke to judah the bellows are burned the lead is consumed of the fire the founder melteth in vain for the wicked are not plucked away reprobate silver shall men call them because the lord hath rejected them jeremiah jeremiah was also aware of sheet silver exemplifying the malleability and ductility of the metal silver spread into plates is brought from tarshish and gold from uphaz the work of the workman and of the hands of the founder blue and purple is their clothing they are all the work of cunning men jeremiah silver also has more negative cultural meanings the idiom thirty pieces of silver referring to a reward for betrayal references the bribe judas iscariot is said in the new testament to have taken from jewish leaders in jerusalem to turn jesus of nazareth over to soldiers of the high priest caiaphas ethically silver also symbolizes greed and degradation of consciousness this is the negative aspect the perverting of its value occurrence and production the abundance of silver in the earth s crust is parts per million almost exactly the same as that of mercury it mostly occurs in sulfide ores especially acanthite and argentite ag s argentite deposits sometimes also contain native silver when they occur in reducing environments and when in contact with salt water they are converted to chlorargyrite including horn silver agcl which is prevalent in chile and new south wales most other silver minerals are silver pnictides or chalcogenides they are generally lustrous semiconductors most true silver deposits as opposed to argentiferous deposits of other metals came from tertiary period vulcanism the principal sources of silver are the ores of copper copper nickel lead and lead zinc obtained from peru bolivia mexico china australia chile poland and serbia peru bolivia and mexico have been mining silver since and are still major world producers top silver producing mines are cannington australia fresnillo mexico san crist bal bolivia antamina peru rudna poland and penasquito mexico top near term mine development projects through are pascua lama chile navidad argentina jaunicipio mexico malku khota bolivia and hackett river canada in central asia tajikistan is known to have some of the largest silver deposits in the world silver is usually found in nature combined with other metals or in minerals that contain silver compounds generally in the form of sulfides such as galena lead sulfide or cerussite lead carbonate so the primary production of silver requires the smelting and then cupellation of argentiferous lead ores a historically important process lead melts at c lead oxide at c and silver melts at c to separate the silver the alloy is melted again at the high temperature of c to c in an oxidizing environment the lead oxidises to lead monoxide then known as litharge which captures the oxygen from the other metals present the liquid lead oxide is removed or absorbed by capillary action into the hearth linings ag s pb s o g pbo absorbed ag l today silver metal is primarily produced instead as a secondary byproduct of electrolytic refining of copper lead and zinc and by application of the parkes process on lead bullion from ore that also contains silver in such processes silver follows the non ferrous metal in question through its concentration and smelting and is later purified out for example in copper production purified copper is electrolytically deposited on the cathode while the less reactive precious metals such as silver and gold collect under the anode as the so called anode slime this is then separated and purified of base metals by treatment with hot aerated dilute sulfuric acid and heating with lime or silica flux before the silver is purified to over purity via electrolysis in nitrate solution commercial grade fine silver is at least pure and purities greater than are available in mexico was the top producer of silver tonnes or of the world s total of t followed by china t and peru t in marine environments silver concentration is low in seawater pmol l levels vary by depth and between water bodies dissolved silver concentrations range from pmol l in coastal surface waters to pmol l in pelagic deep waters analyzing the presence and dynamics of silver in marine environments is difficult due to these particularly low concentrations and complex interactions in the environment although a rare trace metal concentrations are greatly impacted by fluvial aeolian atmospheric and upwelling inputs as well as anthropogenic inputs via discharge waste disposal and emissions from industrial companies other internal processes such as decomposition of organic matter may be a source of dissolved silver in deeper waters which feeds into some surface waters through upwelling and vertical mixing in the atlantic and pacific silver concentrations are minimal at the surface but rise in deeper waters silver is taken up by plankton in the photic zone remobilized with depth and enriched in deep waters silver is transported from the atlantic to the other oceanic water masses in north pacific waters silver is remobilized at a slower rate and increasingly enriched compared to deep atlantic waters silver has increasing concentrations that follow the major oceanic conveyor belt that cycles water and nutrients from the north atlantic to the south atlantic to the north pacific there is not an extensive amount of data focused on how marine life is affected by silver despite the likely deleterious effects it could have on organisms through bioaccumulation association with particulate matters and sorption not until about did scientists begin to understand the chemical characteristics of silver and the potential toxicity in fact mercury is the only other trace metal that surpasses the toxic effects of silver however the full extent of silver toxicity is not expected in oceanic conditions because of its ability to transfer into nonreactive biological compounds in one study the presence of excess ionic silver and silver nanoparticles caused bioaccumulation effects on zebrafish organs and altered the chemical pathways within their gills in addition very early experimental studies demonstrated how the toxic effects of silver fluctuate with salinity and other parameters as well as between life stages and different species such as finfish molluscs and crustaceans another study found raised concentrations of silver in the muscles and liver of dolphins and whales indicating pollution of this metal within recent decades silver is not an easy metal for an organism to eliminate and elevated concentrations can cause death monetary use the earliest known coins were minted in the kingdom of lydia in asia minor around bc the coins of lydia were made of electrum which is a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver that was available within the territory of lydia since that time silver standards in which the standard economic unit of account is a fixed weight of silver have been widespread throughout the world until the th century notable silver coins through the centuries include the greek drachma the roman denarius the islamic dirham the karshapana from ancient india and rupee from the time of the mughal empire grouped with copper and gold coins to create a trimetallic standard and the spanish dollar the ratio between the amount of silver used for coinage and that used for other purposes has fluctuated greatly over time for example in wartime more silver tends to have been used for coinage to finance the war today silver bullion has the iso currency code xag one of only four precious metals to have one the others being palladium platinum and gold silver coins are produced from cast rods or ingots rolled to the correct thickness heat treated and then used to cut blanks from these blanks are then milled and minted in a coining press modern coining presses can produce silver coins per hour price silver prices are normally quoted in troy ounces one troy ounce is equal to grams the london silver fix is published every working day at noon london time this price is determined by several major international banks and is used by london bullion market members for trading that day prices are most commonly shown as the united states dollar usd the pound sterling gbp and the euro eur applications jewellery and silverware the major use of silver besides coinage throughout most of history was in the manufacture of jewellery and other general use items and this continues to be a major use today examples include table silver for cutlery for which silver is highly suited due to its antibacterial properties western concert flutes are usually plated with or made out of sterling silver in fact most silverware is only silver plated rather than made out of pure silver the silver is normally put in place by electroplating silver plated glass as opposed to metal is used for mirrors vacuum flasks and christmas tree decorations because pure silver is very soft most silver used for these purposes is alloyed with copper with finenesses of and being common one drawback is the easy tarnishing of silver in the presence of hydrogen sulfide and its derivatives including precious metals such as palladium platinum and gold gives resistance to tarnishing but is quite costly base metals like zinc cadmium silicon and germanium do not totally prevent corrosion and tend to affect the lustre and colour of the alloy electrolytically refined pure silver plating is effective at increasing resistance to tarnishing the usual solutions for restoring the lustre of tarnished silver are dipping baths that reduce the silver sulfide surface to metallic silver and cleaning off the layer of tarnish with a paste the latter approach also has the welcome side effect of polishing the silver concurrently medicine in medicine silver is incorporated into wound dressings and used as an antibiotic coating in medical devices wound dressings containing silver sulfadiazine or silver nanomaterials are used to treat external infections silver is also used in some medical applications such as urinary catheters where tentative evidence indicates it reduces catheter related urinary tract infections and in endotracheal breathing tubes where evidence suggests it reduces ventilator associated pneumonia the silver ion is bioactive and in sufficient concentration readily kills bacteria in vitro silver ions interfere with enzymes in the bacteria that transport nutrients form structures and synthesise cell walls these ions also bond with the bacteria s genetic material silver and silver nanoparticles are used as an antimicrobial in a variety of industrial healthcare and domestic application for example infusing clothing with nanosilver particles thus allows them to stay odourless for longer bacteria can however develop resistance to the antimicrobial action of silver silver compounds are taken up by the body like mercury compounds but lack the toxicity of the latter silver and its alloys are used in cranial surgery to replace bone and silver tin mercury amalgams are used in dentistry silver diammine fluoride the fluoride salt of a coordination complex with the formula ag nh f is a topical medicament drug used to treat and prevent dental caries cavities and relieve dentinal hypersensitivity electronics silver is very important in electronics for conductors and electrodes on account of its high electrical conductivity even when tarnished bulk silver and silver foils were used to make vacuum tubes and continue to be used today in the manufacture of semiconductor devices circuits and their components for example silver is used in high quality connectors for rf vhf and higher frequencies particularly in tuned circuits such as cavity filters where conductors cannot be scaled by more than printed circuits and rfid antennas are made with silver paints powdered silver and its alloys are used in paste preparations for conductor layers and electrodes ceramic capacitors and other ceramic components brazing alloys silver containing brazing alloys are used for brazing metallic materials mostly cobalt nickel and copper based alloys tool steels and precious metals the basic components are silver and copper with other elements selected according to the specific application desired examples include zinc tin cadmium palladium manganese and phosphorus silver provides increased workability and corrosion resistance during usage chemical equipment silver is useful in the manufacture of chemical equipment on account of its low chemical reactivity high thermal conductivity and being easily workable silver crucibles alloyed with nickel to avoid recrystallisation of the metal at red heat are used for carrying out alkaline fusion copper and silver are also used when doing chemistry with fluorine equipment made to work at high temperatures is often silver plated silver and its alloys with gold are used as wire or ring seals for oxygen compressors and vacuum equipment catalysis silver metal is a good catalyst for oxidation reactions in fact it is somewhat too good for most purposes as finely divided silver tends to result in complete oxidation of organic substances to carbon dioxide and water and hence coarser grained silver tends to be used instead for instance silver supported on al o or silicates is a catalyst for the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide at c dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde is conducted at c over silver gauze or crystals as the catalyst as is dehydrogenation of isopropanol to acetone in the gas phase glycol yields glyoxal and ethanol yields acetaldehyde while organic amines are dehydrated to nitriles photography the photosensitivity of the silver halides allowed for their use in traditional photography although digital photography which does not use silver is now dominant the photosensitive emulsion used in black and white photography is a suspension of silver halide crystals in gelatin possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved photosensitivity developing and tuning colour photography requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers so that the initial black and white silver image couples with a different dye component the original silver images are bleached off and the silver is then recovered and recycled silver nitrate is the starting material in all cases the use of silver nitrate and silver halides in photography has rapidly declined with the advent of digital technology from the peak global demand for photographic silver in troy ounces or tonnes the market contracted almost by nanoparticles nanosilver particles between and nanometres in size are used in many applications they are used in conductive inks for printed electronics and have a much lower melting point than larger silver particles of micrometre size they are also used medicinally in antibacterials and antifungals in much the same way as larger silver particles in addition according to the european union observatory for nanomaterials euon silver nanoparticles are used both in pigments as well as cosmetics miscellanea pure silver metal is used as a food colouring it has the e designation and is approved in the european union traditional indian and pakistani dishes sometimes include decorative silver foil known as vark and in various other cultures silver drag e are used to decorate cakes cookies and other dessert items photochromic lenses include silver halides so that ultraviolet light in natural daylight liberates metallic silver darkening the lenses the silver halides are reformed in lower light intensities colourless silver chloride films are used in radiation detectors zeolite sieves incorporating ag ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues using silver ions to precipitate chloride as silver chloride silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation but the application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption colloidal silver is similarly used to disinfect closed swimming pools while it has the advantage of not giving off a smell like hypochlorite treatments do colloidal silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools small silver iodide crystals are used in cloud seeding to cause rain the texas legislature designated silver the official precious metal of texas in precautions silver compounds have low toxicity compared to those of most other heavy metals as they are poorly absorbed by the human body when ingested and that which does get absorbed is rapidly converted to insoluble silver compounds or complexed by metallothionein however silver fluoride and silver nitrate are caustic and can cause tissue damage resulting in gastroenteritis diarrhoea falling blood pressure cramps paralysis and respiratory arrest animals repeatedly dosed with silver salts have been observed to experience anaemia slowed growth necrosis of the liver and fatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys rats implanted with silver foil or injected with colloidal silver have been observed to develop localised tumours parenterally admistered colloidal silver causes acute silver poisoning some waterborne species are particularly sensitive to silver salts and those of the other precious metals in most situations however silver does not pose serious environmental hazards in large doses silver and compounds containing it can be absorbed into the circulatory system and become deposited in various body tissues leading to argyria which results in a blue grayish pigmentation of the skin eyes and mucous membranes argyria is rare and so far as is known does not otherwise harm a person s health though it is disfiguring and usually permanent mild forms of argyria are sometimes mistaken for cyanosis a blue tint on skin caused by lack of oxygen metallic silver like copper is an antibacterial agent which was known to the ancients and first scientifically investigated and named the oligodynamic effect by carl n geli silver ions damage the metabolism of bacteria even at such low concentrations as milligrams per litre metallic silver has a similar effect due to the formation of silver oxide this effect is lost in the presence of sulfur due to the extreme insolubility of silver sulfide some silver compounds are very explosive such as the nitrogen compounds silver azide silver amide and silver fulminate as well as silver acetylide silver oxalate and silver ii oxide they can explode on heating force drying illumination or sometimes spontaneously to avoid the formation of such compounds ammonia and acetylene should be kept away from silver equipment salts of silver with strongly oxidising acids such as silver chlorate and silver nitrate can explode on contact with materials that can be readily oxidised such as organic compounds sulfur and soot ,47
Cadmium,Cd,cadmium is a chemical element with the symbol cd and atomic number this soft silvery white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in group zinc and mercury like zinc it demonstrates oxidation state in most of its compounds and like mercury it has a lower melting point than the transition metals in groups through cadmium and its congeners in group are often not considered transition metals in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states the average concentration of cadmium in earth s crust is between and parts per million ppm it was discovered in simultaneously by stromeyer and hermann both in germany as an impurity in zinc carbonate cadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production cadmium was used for a long time as a corrosion resistant plating on steel and cadmium compounds are used as red orange and yellow pigments to color glass and to stabilize plastic cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is toxic it is specifically listed in the european restriction of hazardous substances directive and nickel cadmium batteries have been replaced with nickel metal hydride and lithium ion batteries one of its few new uses is in cadmium telluride solar panels although cadmium has no known biological function in higher organisms a cadmium dependent carbonic anhydrase has been found in marine diatoms characteristics physical properties cadmium is a soft malleable ductile silvery white divalent metal it is similar in many respects to zinc but forms complex compounds unlike most other metals cadmium is resistant to corrosion and is used as a protective plate on other metals as a bulk metal cadmium is insoluble in water and is not flammable however in its powdered form it may burn and release toxic fumes chemical properties although cadmium usually has an oxidation state of it also exists in the state cadmium and its congeners are not always considered transition metals in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states cadmium burns in air to form brown amorphous cadmium oxide cdo the crystalline form of this compound is a dark red which changes color when heated similar to zinc oxide hydrochloric acid sulfuric acid and nitric acid dissolve cadmium by forming cadmium chloride cdcl cadmium sulfate cdso or cadmium nitrate cd no the oxidation state can be produced by dissolving cadmium in a mixture of cadmium chloride and aluminium chloride forming the cd cation which is similar to the hg cation in mercury i chloride cd cdcl alcl cd alcl the structures of many cadmium complexes with nucleobases amino acids and vitamins have been determined isotopes naturally occurring cadmium is composed of eight isotopes two of them are radioactive and three are expected to decay but have not done so under laboratory conditions the two natural radioactive isotopes are cd beta decay half life is y and cd two neutrino double beta decay half life is y the other three are cd cd both double electron capture and cd double beta decay only lower limits on these half lives have been determined at least three isotopes cd cd and cd are stable among the isotopes that do not occur naturally the most long lived are cd with a half life of days and cd with a half life of hours all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives of less than hours and the majority have half lives of less than minutes cadmium has known meta states with the most stable being mcd t years mcd t days and mcd t hours the known isotopes of cadmium range in atomic mass from u cd to u cd for isotopes lighter than u the primary decay mode is electron capture and the dominant decay product is element silver heavier isotopes decay mostly through beta emission producing element indium one isotope of cadmium cd absorbs neutrons with high selectivity with very high probability neutrons with energy below the cadmium cut off will be absorbed those higher than the cut off will be transmitted the cadmium cut off is about ev and neutrons below that level are deemed slow neutrons distinct from intermediate and fast neutrons cadmium is created via the s process in low to medium mass stars with masses of to solar masses over thousands of years in that process a silver atom captures a neutron and then undergoes beta decay history cadmium latin cadmia greek meaning calamine a cadmium bearing mixture of minerals that was named after the greek mythological character cadmus the founder of thebes was discovered in contaminated zinc compounds sold in pharmacies in germany in by friedrich stromeyer karl samuel leberecht hermann simultaneously investigated the discoloration in zinc oxide and found an impurity first suspected to be arsenic because of the yellow precipitate with hydrogen sulfide additionally stromeyer discovered that one supplier sold zinc carbonate instead of zinc oxide stromeyer found the new element as an impurity in zinc carbonate calamine and for years germany remained the only important producer of the metal the metal was named after the latin word for calamine because it was found in this zinc ore stromeyer noted that some impure samples of calamine changed color when heated but pure calamine did not he was persistent in studying these results and eventually isolated cadmium metal by roasting and reducing the sulfide the potential for cadmium yellow as pigment was recognized in the s but the lack of cadmium limited this application even though cadmium and its compounds are toxic in certain forms and concentrations the british pharmaceutical codex from states that cadmium iodide was used as a medication to treat enlarged joints scrofulous glands and chilblains in the international astronomical union defined the international ngstr m in terms of a red cadmium spectral line wavelength this was adopted by the th general conference on weights and measures in in the definitions of both the metre and ngstr m were changed to use krypton after the industrial scale production of cadmium started in the s and s the major application of cadmium was the coating of iron and steel to prevent corrosion in and in of the cadmium in the united states was used for plating in of the cadmium in the united states was used for a second application in red orange and yellow pigments from sulfides and selenides of cadmium the stabilizing effect of cadmium chemicals like the carboxylates cadmium laurate and cadmium stearate on pvc led to an increased use of those compounds in the s and s the demand for cadmium in pigments coatings stabilizers and alloys declined as a result of environmental and health regulations in the s and s in only of to total cadmium consumption was used for plating and only was used for pigments at the same time these decreases in consumption were compensated by a growing demand for cadmium for nickel cadmium batteries which accounted for of the cadmium consumption in the united states in occurrence cadmium makes up about ppm of earth s crust it is much rarer than zinc which makes up about ppm no significant deposits of cadmium containing ores are known the only cadmium mineral of importance greenockite cds is nearly always associated with sphalerite zns this association is caused by geochemical similarity between zinc and cadmium with no geological process likely to separate them thus cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct of mining smelting and refining sulfidic ores of zinc and to a lesser degree lead and copper small amounts of cadmium about of consumption are produced from secondary sources mainly from dust generated by recycling iron and steel scrap production in the united states began in but wide use began after world war i metallic cadmium can be found in the vilyuy river basin in siberia rocks mined for phosphate fertilizers contain varying amounts of cadmium resulting in a cadmium concentration of as much as mg kg in the fertilizers and a high cadmium content in agricultural soils coal can contain significant amounts of cadmium which ends up mostly in coal fly ash cadmium in soil can be absorbed by crops such as rice chinese ministry of agriculture measured in that of rice it sampled had excess lead and had excess cadmium above limits defined by law some plants such as willow trees and poplars have been found to clean both lead and cadmium from soil typical background concentrations of cadmium do not exceed ng m in the atmosphere mg kg in soil g l in freshwater and ng l in seawater concentrations of cadmium above g l may be stable in water having low total solute concentrations and p h and can be difficult to remove by conventional water treatment processes production cadmium is a common impurity in zinc ores and it is most often isolated during the production of zinc some zinc ores concentrates from zinc sulfate ores contain up to of cadmium in the s the output of cadmium was pounds kg per ton of zinc zinc sulfide ores are roasted in the presence of oxygen converting the zinc sulfide to the oxide zinc metal is produced either by smelting the oxide with carbon or by electrolysis in sulfuric acid cadmium is isolated from the zinc metal by vacuum distillation if the zinc is smelted or cadmium sulfate is precipitated from the electrolysis solution the british geological survey reports that in china was the top producer of cadmium with almost one sixth of the world s production closely followed by south korea and japan applications cadmium is a common component of electric batteries pigments coatings and electroplating batteries in of cadmium was used in batteries predominantly in rechargeable nickel cadmium batteries nickel cadmium cells have a nominal cell potential of v the cell consists of a positive nickel hydroxide electrode and a negative cadmium electrode plate separated by an alkaline electrolyte potassium hydroxide the european union put a limit on cadmium in electronics in of with some exceptions and in reduced the limit on cadmium content to another type of battery based on cadmium is the silver cadmium battery electroplating cadmium electroplating consuming of the global production is used in the aircraft industry to reduce corrosion of steel components this coating is passivated by chromate salts a limitation of cadmium plating is hydrogen embrittlement of high strength steels from the electroplating process therefore steel parts heat treated to tensile strength above mpa ksi should be coated by an alternative method such as special low embrittlement cadmium electroplating processes or physical vapor deposition titanium embrittlement from cadmium plated tool residues resulted in banishment of those tools and the implementation of routine tool testing to detect cadmium contamination in the a sr u and subsequent aircraft programs that use titanium nuclear fission cadmium is used in the control rods of nuclear reactors acting as a very effective neutron poison to control neutron flux in nuclear fission when cadmium rods are inserted in the core of a nuclear reactor cadmium absorbs neutrons preventing them from creating additional fission events thus controlling the amount of reactivity the pressurized water reactor designed by westinghouse electric company uses an alloy consisting of silver indium and cadmium televisions qled tvs have been starting to include cadmium in construction some companies have been looking to reduce the environmental impact of human exposure and pollution of the material in televisions during production anticancer drugs complexes based on heavy metals have great potential for the treatment of a wide variety of cancers but their use is often limited due to toxic side effects however scientists are advancing in the field and new promising cadmium complex compounds with reduced toxicity have been discovered compounds cadmium oxide was used in black and white television phosphors and in the blue and green phosphors of color television cathode ray tubes cadmium sulfide cds is used as a photoconductive surface coating for photocopier drums various cadmium salts are used in paint pigments with cds as a yellow pigment being the most common cadmium selenide is a red pigment commonly called cadmium red to painters who work with the pigment cadmium provides the most brilliant and durable yellows oranges and reds so much so that during production these colors are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders or blended into watercolors gouaches acrylics and other paint and pigment formulations because these pigments are potentially toxic users should use a barrier cream on the hands to prevent absorption through the skin even though the amount of cadmium absorbed into the body through the skin is reported to be less than in pvc cadmium was used as heat light and weathering stabilizers currently cadmium stabilizers have been completely replaced with barium zinc calcium zinc and organo tin stabilizers cadmium is used in many kinds of solder and bearing alloys because it has a low coefficient of friction and fatigue resistance it is also found in some of the lowest melting alloys such as wood s metal semiconductors cadmium is an element in some semiconductor materials cadmium sulfide cadmium selenide and cadmium telluride are used in some photodetectors and solar cells hgcdte detectors are sensitive to mid infrared light and used in some motion detectors laboratory uses helium cadmium lasers are a common source of blue or ultraviolet laser light lasers at wavelengths of and nm are made using this gain medium some models can switch between these wavelengths they are notably used in fluorescence microscopy as well as various laboratory uses requiring laser light at these wavelengths cadmium selenide quantum dots emit bright luminescence under uv excitation he cd laser for example the color of this luminescence can be green yellow or red depending on the particle size colloidal solutions of those particles are used for imaging of biological tissues and solutions with a fluorescence microscope in molecular biology cadmium is used to block voltage dependent calcium channels from fluxing calcium ions as well as in hypoxia research to stimulate proteasome dependent degradation of hif cadmium selective sensors based on the fluorophore bodipy have been developed for imaging and sensing of cadmium in cells one powerful method for monitoring cadmium in aqueous environments involves electrochemistry by employing a self assembled monolayer one can obtain a cadmium selective electrode with a ppt level sensitivity biological role and research cadmium has no known function in higher organisms and is considered toxic cadmium is considered an environmental pollutant that causes health hazard to living organisms administration of cadmium to cells causes oxidative stress and increases the levels of antioxidants produced by cells to protect against macro molecular damage however a cadmium dependent carbonic anhydrase has been found in some marine diatoms the diatoms live in environments with very low zinc concentrations and cadmium performs the function normally carried out by zinc in other anhydrases this was discovered with x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectroscopy cadmium is preferentially absorbed in the kidneys of humans up to about mg of cadmium is commonly inhaled throughout human childhood and adolescence cadmium is under research regarding its toxicity in humans potentially elevating risks of cancer cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis environment the biogeochemistry of cadmium and its release to the environment has been the subject of review as has the speciation of cadmium in the environment safety individuals and organizations have been reviewing cadmium s bioinorganic aspects for its toxicity the most dangerous form of occupational exposure to cadmium is inhalation of fine dust and fumes or ingestion of highly soluble cadmium compounds inhalation of cadmium fumes can result initially in metal fume fever but may progress to chemical pneumonitis pulmonary edema and death cadmium is also an environmental hazard human exposure is primarily from fossil fuel combustion phosphate fertilizers natural sources iron and steel production cement production and related activities nonferrous metals production and municipal solid waste incineration other sources of cadmium include bread root crops and vegetables there have been a few instances of general population poisoning as the result of long term exposure to cadmium in contaminated food and water research into an estrogen mimicry that may induce breast cancer is ongoing in the decades leading up to world war ii mining operations contaminated the jinz river in japan with cadmium and traces of other toxic metals as a consequence cadmium accumulated in the rice crops along the riverbanks downstream of the mines some members of the local agricultural communities consumed the contaminated rice and developed itai itai disease and renal abnormalities including proteinuria and glucosuria the victims of this poisoning were almost exclusively post menopausal women with low iron and low body stores of other minerals similar general population cadmium exposures in other parts of the world have not resulted in the same health problems because the populations maintained sufficient iron and other mineral levels thus although cadmium is a major factor in the itai itai disease in japan most researchers have concluded that it was one of several factors cadmium is one of six substances banned by the european union s restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive which regulates hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment but allows for certain exemptions and exclusions from the scope of the law the international agency for research on cancer has classified cadmium and cadmium compounds as carcinogenic to humans although occupational exposure to cadmium is linked to lung and prostate cancer there is still uncertainty about the carcinogenicity of cadmium in low environmental exposure recent data from epidemiological studies suggest that intake of cadmium through diet is associated with a higher risk of endometrial breast and prostate cancer as well as with osteoporosis in humans a recent study has demonstrated that endometrial tissue is characterized by higher levels of cadmium in current and former smoking females cadmium exposure is associated with a large number of illnesses including kidney disease early atherosclerosis hypertension and cardiovascular diseases although studies show a significant correlation between cadmium exposure and occurrence of disease in human populations a molecular mechanism has not yet been identified one hypothesis holds that cadmium is an endocrine disruptor and some experimental studies have shown that it can interact with different hormonal signaling pathways for example cadmium can bind to the estrogen receptor alpha and affect signal transduction along the estrogen and mapk signaling pathways at low doses the tobacco plant absorbs and accumulates heavy metals such as cadmium from the surrounding soil into its leaves following tobacco smoke inhalation these are readily absorbed into the body of users tobacco smoking is the most important single source of cadmium exposure in the general population an estimated of the cadmium content of a cigarette is inhaled through smoking absorption of cadmium through the lungs is more effective than through the gut as much as of the cadmium inhaled in cigarette smoke may be absorbed on average cadmium concentrations in the blood of smokers is to times greater than non smokers and in the kidney times greater than in non smokers despite the high cadmium content in cigarette smoke there seems to be little exposure to cadmium from passive smoking in a non smoking population food is the greatest source of exposure high quantities of cadmium can be found in crustaceans mollusks offal frog legs cocoa solids bitter and semi bitter chocolate seaweed fungi and algae products however grains vegetables and starchy roots and tubers are consumed in much greater quantity in the u s and are the source of the greatest dietary exposure there most plants bio accumulate metal toxins such as cadmium and when composted to form organic fertilizers yield a product that often can contain high amounts e g over mg of metal toxins for every kilogram of fertilizer fertilizers made from animal dung e g cow dung or urban waste can contain similar amounts of cadmium the cadmium added to the soil from fertilizers rock phosphates or organic fertilizers become bio available and toxic only if the soil ph is low i e acidic soils zinc copper calcium and iron ions and selenium with vitamin c are used to treat cadmium intoxication though it is not easily reversed regulations because of the adverse effects of cadmium on the environment and human health the supply and use of cadmium is restricted in europe under the reach regulation the efsa panel on contaminants in the food chain specifies that g kg body weight is a tolerable weekly intake for humans the joint fao who expert committee on food additives has declared g kg body weight to be the provisional tolerable weekly intake level the state of california requires a food label to carry a warning about potential exposure to cadmium on products such as cocoa powder the u s occupational safety and health administration osha has set the permissible exposure limit pel for cadmium at a time weighted average twa of ppm the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has not set a recommended exposure limit rel and has designated cadmium as a known human carcinogen the idlh immediately dangerous to life and health level for cadmium is mg m in addition to mercury the presence of cadmium in some batteries has led to the requirement of proper disposal or recycling of batteries product recalls in may a sale of the seats from arsenal f c s old stadium highbury in london england was cancelled when the seats were discovered to contain trace amounts of cadmium reports of high levels of cadmium use in children s jewelry in led to a us consumer product safety commission investigation the u s cpsc issued specific

Indium,In,indium is a chemical element with the symbol in and atomic number indium is the softest metal that is not an alkali metal it is a silvery white metal that resembles tin in appearance it is a post transition metal that makes up parts per million of the earth s crust indium has a melting point higher than sodium and gallium but lower than lithium and tin chemically indium is similar to gallium and thallium and it is largely intermediate between the two in terms of its properties indium was discovered in by ferdinand reich and hieronymous theodor richter by spectroscopic methods they named it for the indigo blue line in its spectrum indium was isolated the next year indium is a minor component in zinc sulfide ores and is produced as a byproduct of zinc refinement it is most notably used in the semiconductor industry in low melting point metal alloys such as solders in soft metal high vacuum seals and in the production of transparent conductive coatings of indium tin oxide ito on glass indium is considered a technology critical element indium has no biological role its compounds are toxic when injected into the bloodstream most occupational exposure is through ingestion from which indium compounds are not absorbed well and inhalation from which they are moderately absorbed properties physical indium is a silvery white highly ductile post transition metal with a bright luster it is so soft mohs hardness that like sodium it can be cut with a knife it also leaves a visible line on paper it is a member of group on the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between its vertical neighbours gallium and thallium like tin a high pitched cry is heard when indium is bent a crackling sound due to crystal twinning like gallium indium is able to wet glass like both indium has a low melting point c f higher than its lighter homologue gallium but lower than its heavier homologue thallium and lower than tin the boiling point is c f higher than that of thallium but lower than gallium conversely to the general trend of melting points but similarly to the trends down the other post transition metal groups because of the weakness of the metallic bonding with few electrons delocalized the density of indium g cm is also greater than gallium but lower than thallium below the critical temperature k indium becomes a superconductor indium crystallizes in the body centered tetragonal crystal system in the space group i mmm lattice parameters a pm c pm this is a slightly distorted face centered cubic structure where each indium atom has four neighbours at pm distance and eight neighbours slightly further pm indium has greater solubility in liquid mercury than any other metal more than mass percent of indium at c indium displays a ductile viscoplastic response found to be size independent in tension and compression however it does have a size effect in bending and indentation associated to a length scale of order m significantly large when compared with other metals chemical indium has electrons with an electronic configuration of kr d s p in compounds indium most commonly donates the three outermost electrons to become indium iii in in some cases the pair of s electrons are not donated resulting in indium i in the stabilization of the monovalent state is attributed to the inert pair effect in which relativistic effects stabilize the s orbital observed in heavier elements thallium indium s heavier homolog shows an even stronger effect causing oxidation to thallium i to be more probable than to thallium iii whereas gallium indium s lighter homolog commonly shows only the oxidation state thus although thallium iii is a moderately strong oxidizing agent indium iii is not and many indium i compounds are powerful reducing agents while the energy required to include the s electrons in chemical bonding is lowest for indium among the group metals bond energies decrease down the group so that by indium the energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining the state is not always enough to outweigh the energy needed to involve the s electrons indium i oxide and hydroxide are more basic and indium iii oxide and hydroxide are more acidic a number of standard electrode potentials depending on the reaction under study are reported for indium reflecting the decreased stability of the oxidation state indium metal does not react with water but it is oxidized by stronger oxidizing agents such as halogens to give indium iii compounds it does not form a boride silicide or carbide and the hydride inh has at best a transitory existence in ethereal solutions at low temperatures being unstable enough to spontaneously polymerize without coordination indium is rather basic in aqueous solution showing only slight amphoteric characteristics and unlike its lighter homologs aluminium and gallium it is insoluble in aqueous alkaline solutions isotopes indium has known isotopes ranging in mass number from to only two isotopes occur naturally as primordial nuclides indium the only stable isotope and indium which has a half life of years four orders of magnitude greater than the age of the universe and nearly times greater than that of natural thorium the half life of in is very long because the beta decay to sn is spin forbidden indium makes up of all indium indium is one of three known elements the others being tellurium and rhenium of which the stable isotope is less abundant in nature than the long lived primordial radioisotopes the stablest artificial isotope is indium with a half life of approximately days all other isotopes have half lives shorter than hours indium also has meta states among which indium m half life about days is the most stable more stable than the ground state of any indium isotope other than the primordial all decay by isomeric transition the indium isotopes lighter than in predominantly decay through electron capture or positron emission to form cadmium isotopes while the other indium isotopes from in and greater predominantly decay through beta minus decay to form tin isotopes compounds indium iii indium iii oxide in o forms when indium metal is burned in air or when the hydroxide or nitrate is heated in o adopts a structure like alumina and is amphoteric that is able to react with both acids and bases indium reacts with water to reproduce soluble indium iii hydroxide which is also amphoteric with alkalis to produce indates iii and with acids to produce indium iii salts in oh hcl incl h othe analogous sesquichalcogenides with sulfur selenium and tellurium are also known indium forms the expected trihalides chlorination bromination and iodination of in produce colorless incl inbr and yellow ini the compounds are lewis acids somewhat akin to the better known aluminium trihalides again like the related aluminium compound inf is polymeric direct reaction of indium with the pnictogens produces the gray or semimetallic iii v semiconductors many of them slowly decompose in moist air necessitating careful storage of semiconductor compounds to prevent contact with the atmosphere indium nitride is readily attacked by acids and alkalis indium i indium i compounds are not common the chloride bromide and iodide are deeply colored unlike the parent trihalides from which they are prepared the fluoride is known only as an unstable gaseous compound indium i oxide black powder is produced when indium iii oxide decomposes upon heating to c other oxidation states less frequently indium forms compounds in oxidation state and even fractional oxidation states usually such materials feature in in bonding most notably in the halides in x and in x and various subchalcogenides such as in se several other compounds are known to combine indium i and indium iii such as ini iniiicl cl ini iniiibr iniiibr and iniiniiibr organoindium compounds organoindium compounds feature in c bonds most are in iii derivatives but cyclopentadienylindium i is an exception it was the first known organoindium i compound and is polymeric consisting of zigzag chains of alternating indium atoms and cyclopentadienyl complexes perhaps the best known organoindium compound is trimethylindium in ch used to prepare certain semiconducting materials history in the german chemists ferdinand reich and hieronymous theodor richter were testing ores from the mines around freiberg saxony they dissolved the minerals pyrite arsenopyrite galena and sphalerite in hydrochloric acid and distilled raw zinc chloride reich who was color blind employed richter as an assistant for detecting the colored spectral lines knowing that ores from that region sometimes contain thallium they searched for the green thallium emission spectrum lines instead they found a bright blue line because that blue line did not match any known element they hypothesized a new element was present in the minerals they named the element indium from the indigo color seen in its spectrum after the latin indicum meaning of india richter went on to isolate the metal in an ingot of kg lb was presented at the world fair reich and richter later fell out when the latter claimed to be the sole discoverer occurrence indium is created by the long lasting up to thousands of years s process slow neutron capture in low to medium mass stars range in mass between and solar masses when a silver atom captures a neutron it transmutes into silver which then undergoes beta decay to become cadmium capturing further neutrons it becomes cadmium which decays to indium by another beta decay this explains why the radioactive isotope is more abundant than the stable one the stable indium isotope indium is one of the p nuclei the origin of which is not fully understood although indium is known to be made directly in the s and r processes rapid neutron capture and also as the daughter of very long lived cadmium which has a half life of about eight quadrillion years this cannot account for all indium indium is the th most abundant element in earth s crust at approximately ppb this is similar to the crustal abundance of silver bismuth and mercury it very rarely forms its own minerals or occurs in elemental form fewer than indium minerals such as roquesite cuins are known and none occur at sufficient concentrations for economic extraction instead indium is usually a trace constituent of more common ore minerals such as sphalerite and chalcopyrite from these it can be extracted as a by product during smelting while the enrichment of indium in these deposits is high relative to its crustal abundance it is insufficient at current prices to support extraction of indium as the main product different estimates exist of the amounts of indium contained within the ores of other metals however these amounts are not extractable without mining of the host materials see production and availability thus the availability of indium is fundamentally determined by the rate at which these ores are extracted and not their absolute amount this is an aspect that is often forgotten in the current debate e g by the graedel group at yale in their criticality assessments explaining the paradoxically low depletion times some studies cite production and availability indium is produced exclusively as a by product during the processing of the ores of other metals its main source material are sulfidic zinc ores where it is mostly hosted by sphalerite minor amounts are probably also extracted from sulfidic copper ores during the roast leach electrowinning process of zinc smelting indium accumulates in the iron rich residues from these it can be extracted in different ways it may also be recovered directly from the process solutions further purification is done by electrolysis the exact process varies with the mode of operation of the smelter its by product status means that indium production is constrained by the amount of sulfidic zinc and copper ores extracted each year therefore its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential the supply potential of a by product is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its host materials per year under current market conditions i e technology and price reserves and resources are not relevant for by products since they cannot be extracted independently from the main products recent estimates put the supply potential of indium at a minimum of t yr from sulfidic zinc ores and t yr from sulfidic copper ores these figures are significantly greater than current production t in thus major future increases in the by product production of indium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price the average indium price in was us kg down from us kg in china is a leading producer of indium tonnes in followed by south korea t japan t and canada t the teck resources refinery in trail british columbia is a large single source indium producer with an output of tonnes in tonnes in and tonnes in the primary consumption of indium worldwide is lcd production demand rose rapidly from the late s to with the popularity of lcd computer monitors and television sets which now account for of indium consumption increased manufacturing efficiency and recycling especially in japan maintain a balance between demand and supply according to the unep indium s end of life recycling rate is less than applications in indium was found to have a valued property of stabilizing non ferrous metals and that became the first significant use for the element the first large scale application for indium was coating bearings in high performance aircraft engines during world war ii to protect against damage and corrosion this is no longer a major use of the element new uses were found in fusible alloys solders and electronics in the s tiny beads of indium were used for the emitters and collectors of pnp alloy junction transistors in the middle and late s the development of indium phosphide semiconductors and indium tin oxide thin films for liquid crystal displays lcd aroused much interest by the thin film application had become the largest end use indium iii oxide and indium tin oxide ito are used as a transparent conductive coating on glass substrates in electroluminescent panels indium tin oxide is used as a light filter in low pressure sodium vapor lamps the infrared radiation is reflected back into the lamp which increases the temperature within the tube and improves the performance of the lamp indium has many semiconductor related applications some indium compounds such as indium antimonide and indium phosphide are semiconductors with useful properties one precursor is usually trimethylindium tmi which is also used as the semiconductor dopant in ii vi compound semiconductors inas and insb are used for low temperature transistors and inp for high temperature transistors the compound semiconductors ingan and ingap are used in light emitting diodes leds and laser diodes indium is used in photovoltaics as the semiconductor copper indium gallium selenide cigs also called cigs solar cells a type of second generation thin film solar cell indium is used in pnp bipolar junction transistors with germanium when soldered at low temperature indium does not stress the germanium indium wire is used as a vacuum seal and a thermal conductor in cryogenics and ultra high vacuum applications in such manufacturing applications as gaskets that deform to fill gaps owing to its great plasticity and adhesion to metals indium sheets are sometimes used for cold soldering in microwave circuits and waveguide joints where direct soldering is complicated indium is an ingredient in the gallium indium tin alloy galinstan which is liquid at room temperature and replaces mercury in some thermometers other alloys of indium with bismuth cadmium lead and tin which have higher but still low melting points between and c are used in fire sprinkler systems and heat regulators indium is one of many substitutes for mercury in alkaline batteries to prevent the zinc from corroding and releasing hydrogen gas indium is added to some dental amalgam alloys to decrease the surface tension of the mercury and allow for less mercury and easier amalgamation indium s high neutron capture cross section for thermal neutrons makes it suitable for use in control rods for nuclear reactors typically in an alloy of silver indium and cadmium in nuclear engineering the n n reactions of in and in are used to determine magnitudes of neutron fluxes in professor mas subramanian and associates at oregon state university discovered that indium can be combined with yttrium and manganese to form an intensely blue non toxic inert fade resistant pigment yinmn blue the first new inorganic blue pigment discovered in years biological role and precautions indium has no metabolic role in any organism in a similar way to aluminium salts indium iii ions can be toxic to the kidney when given by injection indium tin oxide and indium phosphide harm the pulmonary and immune systems predominantly through ionic indium though hydrated indium oxide is more than forty times as toxic when injected measured by the quantity of indium introduced radioactive indium in very small amounts on a chemical basis is used in nuclear medicine tests as a radiotracer to follow the movement of labeled proteins and white blood cells in the body indium compounds are mostly not absorbed upon ingestion and are only moderately absorbed on inhalation they tend to be stored temporarily in the muscles skin and bones before being excreted and the biological half life of indium is about two weeks in humans people can be exposed to indium in the workplace by inhalation ingestion skin contact and eye contact indium lung is a lung disease characterized by pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and pulmonary fibrosis first described by japanese researchers in as of cases had been described though more than indium workers had documented respiratory abnormalities the national institute for

Tin,Sn,tin is a chemical element with the symbol sn from latin stannum and atomic number tin is a silvery coloured metal tin is soft enough to be cut with little force and a bar of tin can be bent by hand with little effort when bent the so called tin cry can be heard as a result of twinning in tin crystals this trait is shared by indium cadmium zinc and mercury in the solid state pure tin after solidifying presents a mirror like appearance similar to most metals in most tin alloys such as pewter the metal solidifies with a dull gray color tin is a post transition metal in group of the periodic table of elements it is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite which contains stannic oxide sno tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group germanium and lead and has two main oxidation states and the slightly more stable tin is the th most abundant element on earth and has with stable isotopes the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table thanks to its magic number of protons it has two main allotropes at room temperature the stable allotrope is tin a silvery white malleable metal at low temperatures it is less dense grey tin which has the diamond cubic structure metallic tin does not easily oxidize in air and water the first tin alloy used on a large scale was bronze made of tin and copper from as early as bc after bc pure metallic tin was produced pewter which is an alloy of tin with the remainder commonly consisting of copper antimony bismuth and sometimes lead and silver has been used for flatware since the bronze age in modern times tin is used in many alloys most notably tin lead soft solders which are typically or more tin and in the manufacture of transparent electrically conducting films of indium tin oxide in optoelectronic applications another large application is corrosion resistant tin plating of steel because of the low toxicity of inorganic tin tin plated steel is widely used for food packaging as tin cans some organotin compounds can be extremely toxic characteristics physical tin is a soft malleable ductile and highly crystalline silvery white metal when a bar of tin is bent a crackling sound known as the tin cry can be heard from the twinning of the crystals tin melts at about c f the lowest in group the melting point is further lowered to c f for nm particles tin the metallic form or white tin has bct structure and is stable at and above room temperature and is malleable tin the nonmetallic form or gray tin is stable below c f and is brittle tin has a diamond cubic crystal structure similar to diamond silicon or germanium tin has no metallic properties because its atoms form a covalent structure in which electrons cannot move freely tin is a dull gray powdery material with no common uses other than specialized semiconductor applications tin and tin exist at temperatures above c f and pressures above several gpa in cold conditions tin tends to transform spontaneously into tin a phenomenon known as tin pest or tin disease some unverifiable sources also say that during napoleon s russian campaign of the temperatures became so cold that the tin buttons on the soldiers uniforms disintegrated over time contributing to the defeat of the grande arm e a persistent legend the transformation temperature is c f but impurities e g al zn etc lower it well below c f with the addition of antimony or bismuth the transformation might not occur at all increasing durability commercial grades of tin tin content resist transformation because of the inhibiting effect of small amounts of bismuth antimony lead and silver present as impurities alloying elements such as copper antimony bismuth cadmium and silver increase the hardness of tin tin easily forms hard brittle intermetallic phases that are typically undesirable it does not mix into a solution with most metals and elements so tin does not have much solid solubility tin mixes well with bismuth gallium lead thallium and zinc forming simple eutectic systems tin becomes a superconductor below k and was one of the first superconductors to be studied the meissner effect one of the characteristic features of superconductors was first discovered in superconducting tin crystals chemical tin resists corrosion from water but can be corroded by acids and alkalis tin can be highly polished and is used as a protective coat for other metals a protective oxide passivation layer prevents further oxidation tin acts as a catalyst triggering a chemical reaction of a solution containing oxygen and helps to increase the speed of the chemical reaction that results isotopes tin has ten stable isotopes the greatest number of any element the isotopes of tin have atomic masses of and sn makes up almost a third of all tin sn and sn are also common while sn is the least common stable isotope the isotopes with even mass numbers have no nuclear spin while those with odd mass numbers have a spin of tin is among the easiest elements to detect and analyze by nmr spectroscopy which relies on molecular weight and its chemical shifts are referenced against snme the large number of stable isotopes is thought to be a direct result of tin having the atomic number a magic number in nuclear physics of the stable isotopes tin has a high capture cross section for fast neutron energies at barns two other isotopes tin ranks next with a cross section of barn while isotope tin has a slightly smaller cross section of barn before these cross sections were well known it was proposed to use tin lead solder as a reactor coolant for fast reactors because of its low melting point current studies are for lead or lead bismuth reactor coolants because both heavy metals are nearly transparent to fast neutrons with very low capture cross sections in order to use a tin or tin lead coolant the tin would first have to go through isotopes separation to remove the and isotopes from the material combined these three isotopes make up about of the entire mass of natural tin but represent nearly all of the capture cross section of the remaining seven isotopes tin has a capture cross section of barn the other six isotopes forming of all tin have capture cross sections of barn or less making them effectively transparent to neutrons like lead and bismuth tin has unstable isotopes ranging in mass number from to the unstable tin isotopes have a half life of less than a year except sn which has a half life of years sn and sn are two of the few nuclides with a doubly magic nucleus which despite being unstable as they have very uneven neutron proton ratios are the endpoints beyond which tin isotopes lighter than sn and heavier than sn are much less stable another metastable isomers have been identified for tin isotopes between and the most stable being msn with a half life of years the relative differences in the number of tin s stable isotopes can be explained by how they are formed during stellar nucleosynthesis sn through sn are formed in the s process slow neutron capture in most stars which leads to them being the most common tin isotopes while sn and sn are only formed in the r process rapid neutron capture in supernovae and are less common tin isotopes sn through sn are also produced in the r process sn sn and sn cannot be made in significant amounts in the s or r processes and are among the p nuclei whose origins are not well understood some ideas about for their formation include proton capture and photodisintegration sn might be partially produced in the s process both directly and as the daughter of long lived in etymology the word tin is shared among germanic languages and can be traced back to reconstructed proto germanic tin om cognates include german zinn swedish tenn and dutch tin it is not found in other branches of indo european except by borrowing from germanic e g irish tinne from english the latin name for tin stannum originally meant an alloy of silver and lead and came to mean tin in the fourth century the earlier latin word for it was plumbum candidum or white lead stannum apparently came from an earlier st gnum meaning the same substance the origin of the romance and celtic terms for tin such as french tain spanish esta o italian stagno and irish st n the origin of stannum st gnum is unknown it may be pre indo european the meyers konversations lexikon suggests instead that stannum came from cornish stean and is evidence that cornwall in the first centuries ad was the main source of tin history tin extraction and use can be dated to the beginnings of the bronze age around bc when it was observed that copper objects formed of polymetallic ores with different metal contents had different physical properties the earliest bronze objects had a tin or arsenic content of less than and are believed to be the result of unintentional alloying due to trace metal content in the copper ore the addition of a second metal to copper increases its hardness lowers the melting temperature and improves the casting process by producing a more fluid melt that cools to a denser less spongy metal this was an important innovation that allowed for the much more complex shapes cast in closed molds of the bronze age arsenical bronze objects appear first in the near east where arsenic is commonly found with copper ore but the health risks were quickly realized and the quest for sources of the much less hazardous tin ores began early in the bronze age this created the demand for rare tin metal and formed a trade network that linked the distant sources of tin to the markets of bronze age cultures cassiterite sno the oxide form of tin was most likely the original source of tin other tin ores are less common sulfides such as stannite that require a more involved smelting process cassiterite often accumulates in alluvial channels as placer deposits because it is harder heavier and more chemically resistant than the accompanying granite cassiterite is usually black or dark in color and these deposits can be easily seen in river banks alluvial placer deposits may incidentally have been collected and separated by methods similar to gold panning compounds and chemistry in the great majority of its compounds tin has the oxidation state ii or iv compounds containing bivalent tin are called stannous while those containing tetravalent tin are termed stannic inorganic compounds halide compounds are known for both oxidation states for sn iv all four halides are well known snf sncl snbr and sni the three heavier members are volatile molecular compounds whereas the tetrafluoride is polymeric all four halides are known for sn ii also snf sncl snbr and sni all are polymeric solids of these eight compounds only the iodides are colored tin ii chloride also known as stannous chloride is the most important commercial tin halide illustrating the routes to such compounds chlorine reacts with tin metal to give sncl whereas the reaction of hydrochloric acid and tin produces sncl and hydrogen gas alternatively sncl and sn combine to stannous chloride by a process called comproportionation sncl sn sncl tin can form many oxides sulfides and other chalcogenide derivatives the dioxide sno cassiterite forms when tin is heated in the presence of air sn is amphoteric which means that it dissolves in both acidic and basic solutions stannates with the structure sn oh like k sn oh are also known though the free stannic acid h sn oh is unknown sulfides of tin exist in both the and oxidation states tin ii sulfide and tin iv sulfide mosaic gold hydrides stannane snh with tin in the oxidation state is unstable organotin hydrides are however well known e g tributyltin hydride sn c h h these compound release transient tributyl tin radicals which are rare examples of compounds of tin iii organotin compounds organotin compounds sometimes called stannanes are chemical compounds with tin carbon bonds of the tin compounds the organic derivatives are commercially the most useful some organotin compounds are highly toxic and have been used as biocides the first organotin compound to be reported was diethyltin diiodide c h sni reported by edward frankland in most organotin compounds are colorless liquids or solids that are stable to air and water they adopt tetrahedral geometry tetraalkyl and tetraaryltin compounds can be prepared using grignard reagents sncl rmgbr r sn mgbrclthe mixed halide alkyls which are more common and more important commercially than the tetraorgano derivatives are prepared by redistribution reactions sncl r sn sncl r divalent organotin compounds are uncommon although more common than related divalent organogermanium and organosilicon compounds the greater stabilization enjoyed by sn ii is attributed to the inert pair effect organotin ii compounds include both stannylenes formula r sn as seen for singlet carbenes and distannylenes r sn which are roughly equivalent to alkenes both classes exhibit unusual reactions occurrence tin is generated via the long s process in low to medium mass stars with masses of to times that of the sun and finally by beta decay of the heavy isotopes of indium tin is the th most abundant element in earth s crust representing ppm compared with ppm for zinc ppm for copper and ppm for lead tin does not occur as the native element but must be extracted from various ores cassiterite sno is the only commercially important source of tin although small quantities of tin are recovered from complex sulfides such as stannite cylindrite franckeite canfieldite and teallite minerals with tin are almost always associated with granite rock usually at a level of tin oxide content because of the higher specific gravity of tin dioxide about of mined tin is from secondary deposits found downstream from the primary lodes tin is often recovered from granules washed downstream in the past and deposited in valleys or the sea the most economical ways of mining tin are by dredging hydraulicking or open pits most of the world s tin is produced from placer deposits which can contain as little as tin about tonnes of tin were mined in mostly in china t indonesia t peru t bolivia t and brazil t estimates of tin production have historically varied with the market and mining technology it is estimated that at current consumption rates and technologies the earth will run out of mine able tin in years in lester brown suggested tin could run out within years based on conservative estimates of annual growth scrap tin is an important source of the metal recovery of tin through recycling is increasing rapidly whereas the united states has neither mined since nor smelted since tin it was the largest secondary producer recycling nearly tonnes in new deposits are reported in mongolia and in new deposits of tin were discovered in colombia production tin is produced by carbothermic reduction of the oxide ore with carbon or coke both reverberatory furnace and electric furnace can be used mining and smelting industry the ten largest companies produced most of the world s tin in most of the world s tin is traded on lme from countries under brands international tin council was established in to control the price of tin it collapsed in in association of tin producing countries was created with australia bolivia indonesia malaysia nigeria thailand and zaire as members price and exchanges tin is unique among mineral commodities because of the complex agreements between producer countries and consumer countries dating back to earlier agreements tended to be somewhat informal and led to the first international tin agreement in the first of a series that effectively collapsed in through these agreements the international tin council itc had a considerable effect on tin prices itc supported the price of tin during periods of low prices by buying tin for its buffer stockpile and was able to restrain the price during periods of high prices by selling from the stockpile this was an anti free market approach designed to assure a sufficient flow of tin to consumer countries and a profit for producer countries however the buffer stockpile was not sufficiently large and during most of those years tin prices rose sometimes sharply especially from through when rampant inflation plagued many world economies during the late s and early s the u s reduced its strategic tin stockpile partly to take advantage of historically high tin prices the recession damaged the tin industry tin consumption declined dramatically itc was able to avoid truly steep declines through accelerated buying for its buffer stockpile this activity required extensive borrowing itc continued to borrow until late when it reached its credit limit immediately a major tin crisis ensued tin was delisted from trading on the london metal exchange for about three years itc dissolved soon afterward and the price of tin now in a free market environment fell to per pound and remained around that level through the s the price increased again by with a rebound in consumption following the economic crisis accompanying restocking and continued growth in consumption london metal exchange lme is tin s principal trading site other tin contract markets are kuala lumpur tin market kltm and indonesia tin exchange inatin due to factors involved in the global supply chain crisis tin prices almost doubled between and have had their largest annual rise in over years the international tin association estimated that global refined tin consumption will grow percent in after losing percent in as the covid pandemic disrupted global manufacturing industries applications in just under half of all tin produced was used in solder the rest was divided between tin plating tin chemicals brass and bronze alloys and niche uses solder tin has long been used in alloys with lead as solder in amounts of to w w tin with lead forms a eutectic mixture at the weight proportion of tin and lead the atomic proportion tin and lead with melting temperature of c f such solders are primarily used for joining pipes or electric circuits since the european union waste electrical and electronic equipment directive weee directive and restriction of hazardous substances directive came into effect on july the lead content in such alloys has decreased while lead exposure is associated with serious health problems lead free solder is not without its challenges including a higher melting point and the formation of tin whiskers that cause electrical problems tin pest can occur in lead free solders leading to loss of the soldered joint replacement alloys are being found but the problems of joint integrity remain tin plating tin bonds readily to iron and is used for coating lead zinc and steel to prevent corrosion tin plated or tinning steel containers is widely used for food preservation and this forms a large part of the market for metallic tin a tinplate canister for preserving food was first manufactured in london in speakers of british english call such containers tins while speakers of american english call them cans or tin cans one derivation of such use is the slang term tinnie or tinny meaning can of beer in australia the tin whistle is so called because it was mass produced first in tin plated steel copper cooking vessels such as saucepans and frying pans are frequently lined with a thin plating of tin by electroplating or by traditional chemical methods since use of copper cookware with acidic foods can be toxic specialized alloys tin in combination with other elements forms a wide variety of useful alloys tin is most commonly alloyed with copper pewter is tin bearing metal has a high percentage of tin as well bronze is mostly copper with tin while the addition of phosphorus yields phosphor bronze bell metal is also a copper tin alloy containing tin tin has sometimes been used in coinage it once formed a single digit percentage usually five percent or less of american and canadian pennies because copper is often the major metal in such coins sometimes including zinc these could be called bronze or brass alloys the niobium tin compound nb sn is commercially used in coils of superconducting magnets for its high critical temperature k and critical magnetic field t a superconducting magnet weighing as little as two kilograms is capable of producing the magnetic field of a conventional electromagnet weighing tons a small percentage of tin is added to zirconium alloys for the cladding of nuclear fuel most metal pipes in a pipe organ are of a tin lead alloy with as the most common composition the proportion of tin in the pipe defines the pipe s tone since tin has a desirable tonal resonance when a tin lead alloy cools the lead phase solidifies first then when the eutectic temperature is reached the remaining liquid forms the layered tin lead eutectic structure which is shiny contrast with the lead phase produces a mottled or spotted effect this metal alloy is referred to as spotted metal major advantages of using tin for pipes include its appearance workability and resistance to corrosion optoelectronics the oxides of indium and tin are electrically conductive and transparent and are used to make transparent electrically conducting films with applications in optoelectronics devices such as liquid crystal displays other applications punched tin plated steel also called pierced tin is an artisan technique originating in central europe for creating functional and decorative housewares decorative piercing designs exist in a wide variety based on local tradition and the artisan punched tin lanterns are the most common application of this artisan technique the light of a candle shining through the pierced design creates a decorative light pattern in the room where it sits lanterns and other punched tin articles were created in the new world from the earliest european settlement a well known example is the revere lantern named after paul revere before the modern era in some areas of the alps a goat or sheep s horn would be sharpened and a tin panel would be punched out using the alphabet and numbers from one to nine this learning tool was known appropriately as the horn modern reproductions are decorated with such motifs as hearts and tulips in america pie safes and food safes were in use in the days before refrigeration these were wooden cupboards of various styles and sizes either floor standing or hanging cupboards meant to discourage vermin and insects and to keep dust from perishable foodstuffs these cabinets had tinplate inserts in the doors and sometimes in the sides punched out by the homeowner cabinetmaker or a tinsmith in varying designs to allow for air circulation while excluding flies modern reproductions of these articles remain popular in north america window glass is most often made by floating molten glass on molten tin float glass resulting in a flat and flawless surface this is also called the pilkington process tin is used as a negative electrode in advanced li ion batteries its application is somewhat limited by the fact that some tin surfaces catalyze decomposition of carbonate based electrolytes used in li ion batteries tin ii fluoride is added to some dental care products as stannous fluoride snf tin ii fluoride can be mixed with calcium abrasives while the more common sodium fluoride gradually becomes biologically inactive in the presence of calcium compounds it has also been shown to be more effective than sodium fluoride in controlling gingivitis tin is used as a target to create laser induced plasmas that act as the light source for extreme ultraviolet lithography organotin compounds the organotin compounds are most heavily used worldwide industrial production probably exceeds tonnes pvc stabilizers the major commercial application of organotin compounds is in the stabilization of pvc plastics in the absence of such stabilizers pvc would rapidly degrade under heat light and atmospheric oxygen resulting in discolored brittle products tin scavenges labile chloride ions cl which would otherwise strip hcl from the plastic material typical tin compounds are carboxylic acid derivatives of dibutyltin dichloride such as the dilaurate biocides some organotin compounds are relatively toxic with both advantages and problems they are used for biocidal properties as fungicides pesticides algaecides wood preservatives and antifouling agents tributyltin oxide is used as a wood preservative tributyltin is also used for various industrial purposes such as slime control in paper mills and disinfection of circulating industrial cooling waters tributyltin was used as additive for ship paint to prevent growth of fouling organisms on ships with use declining after organotin compounds were recognized as persistent organic pollutants with high toxicity for some marine organisms the dog whelk for example the eu banned the use of organotin compounds in while concerns over the toxicity of these compounds to marine life and damage to the reproduction and growth of some marine species some reports describe biological effects to marine life at a concentration of nanogram per liter have led to a worldwide ban by the international maritime organization many nations now restrict the use of organotin compounds to vessels greater than m ft long the persistence of tributyltin in the aquatic environment is dependent upon the nature of the ecosystem because of this persistence and its use as an additive in ship paint high concentrations of tributyltin have been found in marine sediments located near naval docks tributyltin has been used as a biomarker for imposex in neograstropods with at least known species with the high levels of tbt in the local inshore areas due to shipping activities the shellfish had an adverse effect imposex is the imposition of male sexual characteristics on female specimens where they grow a penis and a pallial vas deferens a high level of tbt can damage mammalian endocrine glands reproductive and central nervous systems bone structure and gastrointestinal tract not only does tributyltin affect mammals it affects sea otters whales dolphins and humans organic chemistry some tin reagents are useful in organic chemistry in the largest application stannous chloride is a common reducing agent for the conversion of nitro and oxime groups to amines the stille reaction couples organotin compounds with organic halides or pseudohalides li ion batteries tin forms several inter metallic phases with lithium metal making it a potentially attractive material for battery applications large volumetric expansion of tin upon alloying with lithium and instability of the tin organic electrolyte interface at low electrochemical potentials are the greatest challenges to employment in commercial cells tin inter metallic compound with cobalt and carbon was implemented by sony in its nexelion cells released in the late s the composition of the active material is approximately sn co c research showed that only some crystalline facets of tetragonal beta sn are responsible for undesirable electrochemical activity precautions cases of poisoning from tin metal its oxides and its salts are almost unknown on the other hand certain organotin compounds are almost as toxic as cyanide exposure to tin in the workplace can occur by inhalation skin contact and eye contact the us occupational safety and health administration osha set the permissible exposure limit for tin exposure in the workplace as mg m over an hour workday the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh determined a recommended exposure limit rel of mg m over an hour workday at levels of mg m tin is immediately dangerous to life and health ,50
Antimony,Sb,antimony is a chemical element with the symbol sb from latin stibium and atomic number a lustrous gray metalloid it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite sb s antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were powdered for use as medicine and cosmetics often known by the arabic name kohl the earliest known description of the metal in the west was written in by vannoccio biringuccio china is the largest producer of antimony and its compounds with most production coming from the xikuangshan mine in hunan the industrial methods for refining antimony from stibnite are roasting followed by reduction with carbon or direct reduction of stibnite with iron the largest applications for metallic antimony are in alloys with lead and tin which have improved properties for solders bullets and plain bearings it improves the rigidity of lead alloy plates in lead acid batteries antimony trioxide is a prominent additive for halogen containing flame retardants antimony is used as a dopant in semiconductor devices characteristics properties antimony is a member of group of the periodic table one of the elements called pnictogens and has an electronegativity of in accordance with periodic trends it is more electronegative than tin or bismuth and less electronegative than tellurium or arsenic antimony is stable in air at room temperature but reacts with oxygen if heated to produce antimony trioxide sb o antimony is a silvery lustrous gray metalloid with a mohs scale hardness of which is too soft to mark hard objects coins of antimony were issued in china s guizhou province in durability was poor and minting was soon discontinued antimony is resistant to attack by acids four allotropes of antimony are known a stable metallic form and three metastable forms explosive black and yellow elemental antimony is a brittle silver white shiny metalloid when slowly cooled molten antimony crystallizes into a trigonal cell isomorphic with the gray allotrope of arsenic a rare explosive form of antimony can be formed from the electrolysis of antimony trichloride when scratched with a sharp implement an exothermic reaction occurs and white fumes are given off as metallic antimony forms when rubbed with a pestle in a mortar a strong detonation occurs black antimony is formed upon rapid cooling of antimony vapor it has the same crystal structure as red phosphorus and black arsenic it oxidizes in air and may ignite spontaneously at c it gradually transforms into the stable form the yellow allotrope of antimony is the most unstable it has been generated only by oxidation of stibine sbh at c above this temperature and in ambient light this metastable allotrope transforms into the more stable black allotrope elemental antimony adopts a layered structure space group r m no whose layers consist of fused ruffled six membered rings the nearest and next nearest neighbors form an irregular octahedral complex with the three atoms in each double layer slightly closer than the three atoms in the next this relatively close packing leads to a high density of g cm but the weak bonding between the layers leads to the low hardness and brittleness of antimony isotopes antimony has two stable isotopes sb with a natural abundance of and sb with a natural abundance of it also has radioisotopes of which the longest lived is sb with a half life of years in addition metastable states have been characterized the most stable of these is m sb with a half life of days isotopes that are lighter than the stable sb tend to decay by decay and those that are heavier tend to decay by decay with some exceptions occurrence the abundance of antimony in the earth s crust is estimated to be to parts per million comparable to thallium at parts per million and silver at ppm even though this element is not abundant it is found in more than mineral species antimony is sometimes found natively e g on antimony peak but more frequently it is found in the sulfide stibnite sb s which is the predominant ore mineral compounds antimony compounds are often classified according to their oxidation state sb iii and sb v the oxidation state is more stable oxides and hydroxides antimony trioxide is formed when antimony is burnt in air in the gas phase the molecule of the compound is sb o but it polymerizes upon condensing antimony pentoxide sb o can be formed only by oxidation with concentrated nitric acid antimony also forms a mixed valence oxide antimony tetroxide sb o which features both sb iii and sb v unlike oxides of phosphorus and arsenic these oxides are amphoteric do not form well defined oxoacids and react with acids to form antimony salts antimonous acid sb oh is unknown but the conjugate base sodium antimonite na sbo forms upon fusing sodium oxide and sb o transition metal antimonites are also known antimonic acid exists only as the hydrate hsb oh forming salts as the antimonate anion sb oh when a solution containing this anion is dehydrated the precipitate contains mixed oxides many antimony ores are sulfides including stibnite sb s pyrargyrite ag sbs zinkenite jamesonite and boulangerite antimony pentasulfide is non stoichiometric and features antimony in the oxidation state and s s bonds several thioantimonides are known such as sb s and sb s halides antimony forms two series of halides sbx and sbx the trihalides sbf sbcl sbbr and sbi are all molecular compounds having trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry the trifluoride sbf is prepared by the reaction of sb o with hf sb o hf sbf h oit is lewis acidic and readily accepts fluoride ions to form the complex anions sbf and sbf molten sbf is a weak electrical conductor the trichloride sbcl is prepared by dissolving sb s in hydrochloric acid sb s hcl sbcl h s the pentahalides sbf and sbcl have trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry in the gas phase but in the liquid phase sbf is polymeric whereas sbcl is monomeric sbf is a powerful lewis acid used to make the superacid fluoroantimonic acid h sbf oxyhalides are more common for antimony than for arsenic and phosphorus antimony trioxide dissolves in concentrated acid to form oxoantimonyl compounds such as sbocl and sbo so antimonides hydrides and organoantimony compounds compounds in this class generally are described as derivatives of sb antimony forms antimonides with metals such as indium antimonide insb and silver antimonide ag sb the alkali metal and zinc antimonides such as na sb and zn sb are more reactive treating these antimonides with acid produces the highly unstable gas stibine sbh sb h sbh stibine can also be produced by treating sb salts with hydride reagents such as sodium borohydride stibine decomposes spontaneously at room temperature because stibine has a positive heat of formation it is thermodynamically unstable and thus antimony does not react with hydrogen directly organoantimony compounds are typically prepared by alkylation of antimony halides with grignard reagents a large variety of compounds are known with both sb iii and sb v centers including mixed chloro organic derivatives anions and cations examples include sb c h triphenylstibine sb c h with an sb sb bond and cyclic sb c h n pentacoordinated organoantimony compounds are common examples being sb c h and several related halides history antimony iii sulfide sb s was recognized in predynastic egypt as an eye cosmetic kohl as early as about bc when the cosmetic palette was invented an artifact said to be part of a vase made of antimony dating to about bc was found at telloh chaldea part of present day iraq and a copper object plated with antimony dating between bc and bc has been found in egypt austen at a lecture by herbert gladstone in commented that we only know of antimony at the present day as a highly brittle and crystalline metal which could hardly be fashioned into a useful vase and therefore this remarkable find artifact mentioned above must represent the lost art of rendering antimony malleable the british archaeologist roger moorey was unconvinced the artifact was indeed a vase mentioning that selimkhanov after his analysis of the tello object published in attempted to relate the metal to transcaucasian natural antimony i e native metal and that the antimony objects from transcaucasia are all small personal ornaments this weakens the evidence for a lost art of rendering antimony malleable the roman scholar pliny the elder described several ways of preparing antimony sulfide for medical purposes in his treatise natural history around ad pliny the elder also made a distinction between male and female forms of antimony the male form is probably the sulfide while the female form which is superior heavier and less friable has been suspected to be native metallic antimony the greek naturalist pedanius dioscorides mentioned that antimony sulfide could be roasted by heating by a current of air it is thought that this produced metallic antimony antimony was frequently described in alchemical manuscripts including the summa perfectionis of pseudo geber written around the th century a description of a procedure for isolating antimony is later given in the book de la pirotechnia by vannoccio biringuccio predating the more famous book by agricola de re metallica in this context agricola has been often incorrectly credited with the discovery of metallic antimony the book currus triumphalis antimonii the triumphal chariot of antimony describing the preparation of metallic antimony was published in germany in it was purported to be written by a benedictine monk writing under the name basilius valentinus in the th century if it were authentic which it is not it would predate biringuccio the metal antimony was known to german chemist andreas libavius in who obtained it by adding iron to a molten mixture of antimony sulfide salt and potassium tartrate this procedure produced antimony with a crystalline or starred surface with the advent of challenges to phlogiston theory it was recognized that antimony is an element forming sulfides oxides and other compounds as do other metals the first discovery of naturally occurring pure antimony in the earth s crust was described by the swedish scientist and local mine district engineer anton von swab in the type sample was collected from the sala silver mine in the bergslagen mining district of sala v stmanland sweden etymology the medieval latin form from which the modern languages and late byzantine greek take their names for antimony is antimonium the origin of this is uncertain all suggestions have some difficulty either of form or interpretation the popular etymology from anti monachos or french antimoine still has adherents this would mean monk killer and is explained by many early alchemists being monks and antimony being poisonous however the low toxicity of antimony see below makes this unlikely another popular etymology is the hypothetical greek word antimonos against aloneness explained as not found as metal or not found unalloyed lippmann conjectured a hypothetical greek word anthemonion which would mean floret and cites several examples of related greek words but not that one which describe chemical or biological efflorescence the early uses of antimonium include the translations in by constantine the african of arabic medical treatises several authorities believe antimonium is a scribal corruption of some arabic form meyerhof derives it from ithmid other possibilities include athimar the arabic name of the metalloid and a hypothetical as stimmi derived from or parallel to the greek the standard chemical symbol for antimony sb is credited to j ns jakob berzelius who derived the abbreviation from stibium the ancient words for antimony mostly have as their chief meaning kohl the sulfide of antimony the egyptians called antimony m dmt in hieroglyphs the vowels are uncertain but the coptic form of the word is st m egyptian stm the greek word stimmi is used by attic tragic poets of the th century bc and is possibly a loan word from arabic or from egyptian stm later greeks also used stibi as did celsus and pliny writing in latin in the first century ad pliny also gives the names stimi larbaris alabaster and the very common platyophthalmos wide eye from the effect of the cosmetic later latin authors adapted the word to latin as stibium the arabic word for the substance as opposed to the cosmetic can appear as ithmid athmoud othmod or uthmod littr suggests the first form which is the earliest derives from stimmida an accusative for stimmi production process the extraction of antimony from ores depends on the quality and composition of the ore most antimony is mined as the sulfide lower grade ores are concentrated by froth flotation while higher grade ores are heated to c the temperature at which stibnite melts and separates from the gangue minerals antimony can be isolated from the crude antimony sulfide by reduction with scrap iron sb s fe sb festhe sulfide is converted to an oxide the product is then roasted sometimes for the purpose of vaporizing the volatile antimony iii oxide which is recovered this material is often used directly for the main applications impurities being arsenic and sulfide antimony is isolated from the oxide by a carbothermal reduction sb o c sb co the lower grade ores are reduced in blast furnaces while the higher grade ores are reduced in reverberatory furnaces top producers and production volumes the british geological survey bgs reported that in china was the top producer of antimony with approximately of the world share followed at a distance by south africa bolivia and tajikistan xikuangshan mine in hunan province has the largest deposits in china with an estimated deposit of million metric tons in according to the us geological survey china accounted for of total antimony production followed in second place by russia with and tajikistan with chinese production of antimony is expected to decline in the future as mines and smelters are closed down by the government as part of pollution control especially due to an environmental protection law having gone into effect in january and revised emission standards of pollutants for stanum antimony and mercury having gone into effect hurdles for economic production are higher according to the national bureau of statistics in china by september of antimony production capacity in the hunan province the province with biggest antimony reserves in china had not been used reported production of antimony in china has fallen and is unlikely to increase in the coming years according to the roskill report no significant antimony deposits in china have been developed for about ten years and the remaining economic reserves are being rapidly depleted the world s largest antimony producers according to roskill are listed below

applications about of antimony is consumed in flame retardants and is used in alloys for batteries plain bearings and solders flame retardants antimony is mainly used as the trioxide for flame proofing compounds always in combination with halogenated flame retardants except in halogen containing polymers the flame retarding effect of antimony trioxide is produced by the formation of halogenated antimony compounds which react with hydrogen atoms and probably also with oxygen atoms and oh radicals thus inhibiting fire markets for these flame retardants include children s clothing toys aircraft and automobile seat covers they are also added to polyester resins in fiberglass composites for such items as light aircraft engine covers the resin will burn in the presence of an externally generated flame but will extinguish when the external flame is removed alloys antimony forms a highly useful alloy with lead increasing its hardness and mechanical strength for most applications involving lead varying amounts of antimony are used as alloying metal in lead acid batteries this addition improves plate strength and charging characteristics for sailboats lead keels

metal does not affect human and environmental health inhalation of antimony trioxide and similar poorly soluble sb iii dust particles such as antimony dust is considered harmful and suspected of

Tellurium,Te,tellurium is a chemical element with the symbol te and atomic number it is a brittle mildly toxic rare silver white metalloid tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur all three of which are chalcogens it is occasionally found in native form as elemental crystals tellurium is far more common in the universe as a whole than on earth its extreme rarity in the earth s crust comparable to that of platinum is due partly to its formation of a volatile hydride that caused tellurium to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of earth tellurium bearing compounds were first discovered in in a gold mine in kleinschlatten transylvania now zlatna romania by austrian mineralogist franz joseph m ller von reichenstein although it was martin heinrich klaproth who named the new element in after the latin tellus earth gold telluride minerals are the most notable natural gold compounds however they are not a commercially significant source of tellurium itself which is normally extracted as a by product of copper and lead production commercially the primary use of tellurium is copper tellurium copper and steel alloys where it improves machinability applications in cdte solar panels and cadmium telluride semiconductors also consume a considerable portion of tellurium production tellurium is considered a technology critical element tellurium has no biological function although fungi can use it in place of sulfur and selenium in amino acids such as tellurocysteine and telluromethionine in humans tellurium is partly metabolized into dimethyl telluride ch te a gas with a garlic like odor exhaled in the breath of victims of tellurium exposure or poisoning characteristics physical properties tellurium has two allotropes crystalline and amorphous when crystalline tellurium is silvery white with a metallic luster the crystals are trigonal and chiral space group or depending on the chirality like the gray form of selenium it is a brittle and easily pulverized metalloid amorphous tellurium is a black brown powder prepared by precipitating it from a solution of tellurous acid or telluric acid te oh tellurium is a semiconductor that shows a greater electrical conductivity in certain directions depending on atomic alignment the conductivity increases slightly when exposed to light photoconductivity when molten tellurium is corrosive to copper iron and stainless steel of the chalcogens oxygen family elements tellurium has the highest melting and boiling points at k c and k c respectively chemical properties crystalline tellurium consists of parallel helical chains of te atoms with three atoms per turn this gray material resists oxidation by air and is not volatile isotopes naturally occurring tellurium has eight isotopes six of those isotopes te te te te te and te are stable the other two te and te have been found to be slightly radioactive with extremely long half lives including years for te this is the longest known half life among all radionuclides and is about trillion times the age of the known universe stable isotopes comprise only of naturally occurring tellurium a further artificial radioisotopes of tellurium are known with atomic masses ranging from to and with half lives of days or less also nuclear isomers are known with half lives up to days with the exception of beryllium and beta delayed alpha emission branches in some lighter nuclides tellurium te to te is the lightest element with isotopes known to undergo alpha decay the atomic mass of tellurium g mol exceeds that of iodine g mol the next element in the periodic table occurrence with an abundance in the earth s crust comparable to that of platinum about g kg tellurium is one of the rarest stable solid elements in comparison even thulium the rarest of the stable lanthanides have crustal abundances of g kg see abundance of the chemical elements this rarity of tellurium in the earth s crust is not a reflection of its cosmic abundance tellurium is more abundant than rubidium in the cosmos though rubidium is times more abundant in the earth s crust the rarity of tellurium on earth is thought to be caused by conditions during preaccretional sorting in the solar nebula when the stable form of certain elements in the absence of oxygen and water was controlled by the reductive power of free hydrogen under this scenario certain elements that form volatile hydrides such as tellurium were severely depleted through evaporation of these hydrides tellurium and selenium are the heavy elements most depleted by this process tellurium is sometimes found in its native i e elemental form but is more often found as the tellurides of gold such as calaverite and krennerite two different polymorphs of aute petzite ag aute and sylvanite agaute the town of telluride colorado was named in hope of a strike of gold telluride which never materialized though gold metal ore was found gold itself is usually found uncombined but when found as a chemical compound it is most often combined with tellurium although tellurium is found with gold more often than in uncombined form it is found even more often combined as tellurides of more common metals e g melonite nite natural tellurite and tellurate minerals also occur formed by oxidation of tellurides near the earth s surface in contrast to selenium tellurium does not usually replace sulfur in minerals because of the great difference in ion radii thus many common sulfide minerals contain substantial quantities of selenium and only traces of tellurium in the gold rush of miners in kalgoorlie discarded a pyritic material as they searched for pure gold and it was used to fill in potholes and build sidewalks in that tailing was discovered to be calaverite a telluride of gold and it sparked a second gold rush that included mining the streets history tellurium latin tellus meaning earth was discovered in the th century in a gold ore from the mines in kleinschlatten today zlatna near today s city of alba iulia romania this ore was known as faczebajer wei es bl ttriges golderz white leafy gold ore from faczebaja german name of faceb nya now fa a b ii in alba county or antimonalischer goldkies antimonic gold pyrite and according to anton von rupprecht was spie glask nig argent molybdique containing native antimony in franz joseph m ller von reichenstein who was then serving as the austrian chief inspector of mines in transylvania concluded that the ore did not contain antimony but was bismuth sulfide the following year he reported that this was erroneous and that the ore contained mostly gold and an unknown metal very similar to antimony after a thorough investigation that lasted three years and included more than fifty tests m ller determined the specific gravity of the mineral and noted that when heated the new metal gives off a white smoke with a radish like odor that it imparts a red color to sulfuric acid and that when this solution is diluted with water it has a black precipitate nevertheless he was not able to identify this metal and gave it the names aurum paradoxum paradoxical gold and metallum problematicum problem metal because it did not exhibit the properties predicted for antimony in a hungarian scientist p l kitaibel discovered the element independently in an ore from deutsch pilsen that had been regarded as argentiferous molybdenite but later he gave the credit to m ller in it was named by martin heinrich klaproth who had earlier isolated it from the mineral calaverite in the early s thomas midgley jr found tellurium prevented engine knocking when added to fuel but ruled it out due to the difficult to eradicate smell midgley went on to discover and popularize the use of tetraethyl lead the s brought an increase in thermoelectric applications for tellurium as bismuth telluride and in free machining steel alloys which became the dominant use production most te and se is obtained from porphyry copper deposits where it occurs in trace amounts the element is recovered from anode sludges from the electrolytic refining of blister copper it is a component of dusts from blast furnace refining of lead treatment of tons of copper ore typically yields one kilogram pounds of tellurium the anode sludges contain the selenides and tellurides of the noble metals in compounds with the formula m se or m te m cu ag au at temperatures of c the anode sludges are roasted with sodium carbonate under air the metal ions are reduced to the metals while the telluride is converted to sodium tellurite tellurites can be leached from the mixture with water and are normally present as hydrotellurites hteo in solution selenites are also formed during this process but they can be separated by adding sulfuric acid the hydrotellurites are converted into the insoluble tellurium dioxide while the selenites stay in solution the metal is produced from the oxide reduced either by electrolysis or by reacting the tellurium dioxide with sulfur dioxide in sulfuric acid commercial grade tellurium is usually marketed as mesh powder but is also available as slabs ingots sticks or lumps the year end price for tellurium in was us per pound in recent years the tellurium price was driven up by increased demand and limited supply reaching as high as us per pound in despite the expectation that improved production methods will double production the united states department of energy doe anticipates a supply shortfall of tellurium by tellurium is produced mainly in the united states peru japan and canada the british geological survey gives the following production numbers for united states t peru t japan t and canada t compounds tellurium belongs to the chalcogen group family of elements on the periodic table which also includes oxygen sulfur selenium and polonium tellurium and selenium compounds are similar tellurium exhibits the oxidation states and with being most common tellurides reduction of te metal produces the tellurides and polytellurides ten the oxidation state is exhibited in binary compounds with many metals such as zinc telluride znte produced by heating tellurium with zinc decomposition of znte with hydrochloric acid yields hydrogen telluride h te a highly unstable analogue of the other chalcogen hydrides h o h s and h se h te is unstable whereas salts of its conjugate base teh are stable halides the oxidation state is exhibited by the dihalides tecl tebr and tei the dihalides have not been obtained in pure form although they are known decomposition products of the tetrahalides in organic solvents and the derived tetrahalotellurates are well characterized where x is cl br or i these anions are square planar in geometry polynuclear anionic species also exist such as the dark brown te i and the black te i with fluorine te forms the mixed valence te f and tef in the oxidation state the otef structural group occurs in a number of compounds such as hotef b otef xe otef te otef and te otef the square antiprismatic anion tef is also attested the other halogens do not form halides with tellurium in the oxidation state but only tetrahalides tecl tebr and tei in the state and other lower halides te cl te cl te br te i and two forms of tei in the oxidation state halotellurate anions are known such as tecl and te cl halotellurium cations are also attested including tei found in tei asf oxocompounds tellurium monoxide was first reported in as a black amorphous solid formed by the heat decomposition of teso in vacuum disproportionating into tellurium dioxide teo and elemental tellurium upon heating since then however existence in the solid phase is doubted and in dispute although it is known as a vapor fragment the black solid may be merely an equimolar mixture of elemental tellurium and tellurium dioxide tellurium dioxide is formed by heating tellurium in air where it burns with a blue flame tellurium trioxide teo is obtained by thermal decomposition of te oh the other two forms of trioxide reported in the literature the and forms were found not to be true oxides of tellurium in the oxidation state but a mixture of te oh and o tellurium also exhibits mixed valence oxides te o and te o the tellurium oxides and hydrated oxides form a series of acids including tellurous acid h teo orthotelluric acid te oh and metatelluric acid h teo n the two forms of telluric acid form tellurate salts containing the teo and teo anions respectively tellurous acid forms tellurite salts containing the anion teo zintl cations when tellurium is treated with concentrated sulfuric acid the result is a red solution of the zintl ion te the oxidation of tellurium by asf in liquid so produces the same square planar cation in addition to the trigonal prismatic yellow orange te other tellurium zintl cations include the polymeric te and the blue black te consisting of two fused membered tellurium rings the latter cation is formed by the reaction of tellurium with tungsten hexachloride interchalcogen cations also exist such as te se distorted cubic geometry and te se these are formed by oxidizing mixtures of tellurium and selenium with asf or sbf organotellurium compounds tellurium does not readily form analogues of alcohols and thiols with the functional group teh that are called tellurols the teh functional group is also attributed using the prefix tellanyl like h te these species are unstable with respect to loss of hydrogen telluraethers r te r are more stable as are telluroxides tritelluride quantum materials recently physicists and materials scientists have been discovering unusual quantum properties associated with layered compounds composed of tellurium that s combined with certain rare earth elements as well as yttrium y these novel materials have the general formula of r te where r represents a rare earth lanthanide or y with the full family consisting of r y la ce pr nd sm gd tb dy ho er tm not yet observed are compounds containing pm eu yb lu these materials have a two dimensional character within an orthorhombic crystal structure with slabs of r te separated by sheets of pure te it s thought that this d layered structure is what leads to a number of interesting quantum features such as charge density waves high carrier mobility superconductivity under specific conditions and other peculiar properties whose natures are only now emerging for example in a small group of physicists at boston college in massachusetts led an international team that used optical methods to demonstrate a novel axial mode of a higgs like particle in r te compounds that incorporate either of two rare earth elements r la gd this long hypothesized axial higgs like particle also shows magnetic properties and may serve as a candidate for dark matter applications the largest consumer of tellurium is metallurgy in iron stainless steel copper and lead alloys the addition of steel and copper produces an alloy more machinable it is alloyed into cast iron for promoting chill for spectroscopy where the presence of electrically conductive free graphite tends to interfere with spark emission testing results tellurium decreases the corrosive action of sulfuric acid and it improves the strength and durability of lead alloys heterogeneous catalysis tellurium oxides are components of commercial oxidation catalysts te containing catalysts are used for the ammoxidation route to acrylonitrile ch ch c n related catalysts are used in the production of tetramethylene glycol niche synthetic rubber vulcanized with tellurium shows mechanical and thermal properties that in some ways are superior to sulfur vulcanized materials tellurium compounds are specialized pigments for ceramics selenides and tellurides greatly increase the optical refraction of glass widely used in glass optical fibers for telecommunications mixtures of selenium and tellurium are used with barium peroxide as an oxidizer in the delay powder of electric blasting caps neutron bombardment of tellurium is the most common way to produce iodine this in turn is used to treat some thyroid conditions and as a tracer compound in hydraulic fracturing among other applications semiconductor and electronic because of its low electronegativity tellurium form a variety of materials with small band gaps which are addressable by relatively long wavelength light this feature is the basis for potential applications in photoconductive materials solar cells infrared detectors the main concern holding back some application are the modest stability of these materials and concerns about environmental impact cadmium telluride cdte solar panels exhibit some of the greatest efficiencies for solar cell electric power generators cd zn te based x ray detectors have been demonstrated mercury cadmium telluride is a semiconductor material that is sensitive to infrared radiation organotellurium compounds organotellurium compounds are mainly of interest in the research context several have been examined such as precursors for metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy

dipte is the preferred precursor for low temperature growth of cdhgte by movpe the greatest purity metalorganics of both selenium and tellurium are used in these processes the compounds for semiconductor industry and are prepared by adduct purification tellurium suboxide is used in the media layer of rewritable optical discs including rewritable compact discs cd rw rewritable digital video discs dvd rw and rewritable blu ray discs tellurium dioxide is used to create acousto optic modulators aotfs and aobss for confocal microscopy tellurium is used in the phase change memory chips developed by intel bismuth telluride bi te and lead telluride are working elements of thermoelectric devices lead telluride exhibits promise in far infrared detectors photocathodes tellurium shows up in a number of photocathodes used in solar blind photomultiplier tubes and for high brightness photoinjectors driving modern particle accelerators the photocathode cs te which is predominantly cs te has a photoemission threshold of ev and exhibits the uncommon combination of high quantum efficiency and high durability in poor vacuum environments lasting for months under use in rf electron guns this has made it the go to choice for photoemission electron guns used in driving free electron lasers in this application it is usually driven at the wavelength nm which is the third harmonic of commonly used ti sapphire lasers more te containing photocathodes have been grown using other alkali metals such as rubidium potassium and sodium but they have not found the same popularity that cs te has enjoyed thermoelectric material tellurium itself can be used as a high performance elemental thermoelectric material a trigonal te with the space group of p can transfer into a topological insulator phase which is suitable for thermoelectric material though often not considered as a thermoelectric material alone polycrystalline tellurium does show great thermoelectric performance with the thermoelectric figure of merit zt as high as which is even higher than some of other conventional te materials like sige and bisb telluride which is a compound form of tellurium is a more common te material typical and ongoing research includes bi te and la xte etc bi te is widely used from energy conversion to sensing to cooling due to its great te properties the bite based te material can achieve a conversion efficiency of an average zt value of for p type and for n type bismuth telluride alloys lanthanum telluride can be potentially used in deep space as a thermoelectric generator due to the huge temperature difference in space the zt value reaches to a maximum of for a la xte system with x near this composition also allows other chemical substitution which may enhance the te performance the addition of yb for example may increase the zt value from to at k which is greater than the current sige power system biological role tellurium has no known biological function although fungi can incorporate it in place of sulfur and selenium into amino acids such as telluro cysteine and telluro methionine organisms have shown a highly variable tolerance to tellurium compounds many bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa take up tellurite and reduce it to elemental tellurium which accumulates and causes a characteristic and often dramatic darkening of cells in yeast this reduction is mediated by the sulfate assimilation pathway tellurium accumulation seems to account for a major part of the toxicity effects many organisms also metabolize tellurium partly to form dimethyl telluride although dimethyl ditelluride is also formed by some species dimethyl telluride has been observed in hot springs at very low concentrations tellurite agar is used to identify members of the corynebacterium genus most typically corynebacterium diphtheriae the pathogen responsible for diphtheria precautions tellurium and tellurium compounds are considered to be mildly toxic and need to be handled with care although acute poisoning is rare tellurium poisoning is particularly difficult to treat as many chelation agents used in the treatment of metal poisoning will increase the toxicity of tellurium tellurium is not reported to be carcinogenic humans exposed to as little as mg m or less in air exude a foul garlic like odor known as tellurium breath this is caused by the body converting tellurium from any oxidation state to dimethyl telluride ch te this is a volatile compound with a pungent garlic like smell even though the metabolic pathways of tellurium are not known it is generally assumed that they resemble those of the more extensively studied selenium because the final methylated metabolic products of the two elements are similar people can be exposed to tellurium in the workplace by inhalation ingestion skin contact and eye contact the occupational safety and health administration osha limits permissible exposure limit tellurium exposure in the workplace to mg m over an eight hour workday the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set the recommended exposure limit rel at mg m over an eight hour workday in concentrations of mg m tellurium is immediately dangerous to life and health ,52
Iodine,I,iodine is a chemical element with the symbol i and atomic number the heaviest of the stable halogens it exists as a semi lustrous non metallic solid at standard conditions that melts to form a deep violet liquid at c f and boils to a violet gas at c f the element was discovered by the french chemist bernard courtois in and was named two years later by joseph louis gay lussac after the ancient greek violet coloured iodine occurs in many oxidation states including iodide i iodate io and the various periodate anions it is the least abundant of the stable halogens being the sixty first most abundant element as the heaviest essential mineral nutrient iodine is required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones iodine deficiency affects about two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of intellectual disabilities the dominant producers of iodine today are chile and japan due to its high atomic number and ease of attachment to organic compounds it has also found favour as a non toxic radiocontrast material because of the specificity of its uptake by the human body radioactive isotopes of iodine can also be used to treat thyroid cancer iodine is also used as a catalyst in the industrial production of acetic acid and some polymers it is on the world health organization s list of essential medicines history in iodine was discovered by french chemist bernard courtois who was born to a manufacturer of saltpetre an essential component of gunpowder at the time of the napoleonic wars saltpetre was in great demand in france saltpetre produced from french nitre beds required sodium carbonate which could be isolated from seaweed collected on the coasts of normandy and brittany to isolate the sodium carbonate seaweed was burned and the ash washed with water the remaining waste was destroyed by adding sulfuric acid courtois once added excessive sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapour rose he noted that the vapour crystallised on cold surfaces making dark crystals courtois suspected that this material was a new element but lacked funding to pursue it further courtois gave samples to his friends charles bernard desormes and nicolas cl ment to continue research he also gave some of the substance to chemist joseph louis gay lussac and to physicist andr marie amp re on november desormes and cl ment made courtois discovery public they described the substance to a meeting of the imperial institute of france on december gay lussac announced that the new substance was either an element or a compound of oxygen gay lussac suggested the name iode from the ancient greek ioeid s violet because of the colour of iodine vapor amp re had given some of his sample to english chemist humphry davy who experimented on the substance and noted its similarity to chlorine davy sent a letter dated december to the royal society of london stating that he had identified a new element arguments erupted between davy and gay lussac over who identified iodine first but both scientists acknowledged courtois as the first to isolate the element in the french medical researcher casimir joseph davaine discovered the antiseptic action of iodine antonio grossich an istrian born surgeon was among the first to use sterilisation of the operative field in he introduced tincture of iodine as a way to rapidly sterilise the human skin in the surgical field in early periodic tables iodine was often given the symbol j for jod its name in german properties iodine is the fourth halogen being a member of group in the periodic table below fluorine chlorine and bromine it is the heaviest stable member of its group the fifth and sixth halogens the radioactive astatine and tennessine are not well studied due to their expense and inaccessibility in large quantities but appear to show various unusual properties for the group due to relativistic effects iodine has an electron configuration of kr d s p with the seven electrons in the fifth and outermost shell being its valence electrons like the other halogens it is one electron short of a full octet and is hence an oxidising agent reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell although in keeping with periodic trends it is the weakest oxidising agent among the stable halogens it has the lowest electronegativity among them just on the pauling scale compare fluorine chlorine and bromine at and respectively astatine continues the trend with an electronegativity of elemental iodine hence forms diatomic molecules with chemical formula i where two iodine atoms share a pair of electrons in order to each achieve a stable octet for themselves at high temperatures these diatomic molecules reversibly dissociate a pair of iodine atoms similarly the iodide anion i is the strongest reducing agent among the stable halogens being the most easily oxidised back to diatomic i astatine goes further being indeed unstable as at and readily oxidised to at or at the halogens darken in colour as the group is descended fluorine is a very pale yellow chlorine is greenish yellow bromine is reddish brown and iodine is violet elemental iodine is slightly soluble in water with one gram dissolving in ml at c and ml at c potassium iodide may be added to increase solubility via formation of triiodide ions among other polyiodides nonpolar solvents such as hexane and carbon tetrachloride provide a higher solubility polar solutions such as aqueous solutions are brown reflecting the role of these solvents as lewis bases on the other hand nonpolar solutions are violet the color of iodine vapour charge transfer complexes form when iodine is dissolved in polar solvents hence changing the colour iodine is violet when dissolved in carbon tetrachloride and saturated hydrocarbons but deep brown in alcohols and amines solvents that form charge transfer adducts the melting and boiling points of iodine are the highest among the halogens conforming to the increasing trend down the group since iodine has the largest electron cloud among them that is the most easily polarised resulting in its molecules having the strongest van der waals interactions among the halogens similarly iodine is the least volatile of the halogens though the solid still can be observed to give off purple vapor due to this property iodine is commonly used to demonstrate sublimation directly from solid to gas which gives rise to a misconception that it does not melt in atmospheric pressure because it has the largest atomic radius among the halogens iodine has the lowest first ionisation energy lowest electron affinity lowest electronegativity and lowest reactivity of the halogens the interhalogen bond in diiodine is the weakest of all the halogens as such of a sample of gaseous iodine at atmospheric pressure is dissociated into iodine atoms at c temperatures greater than c are required for fluorine chlorine and bromine to dissociate to a similar extent most bonds to iodine are weaker than the analogous bonds to the lighter halogens gaseous iodine is composed of i molecules with an i i bond length of pm the i i bond is one of the longest single bonds known it is even longer pm in solid orthorhombic crystalline iodine which has the same crystal structure as chlorine and bromine the record is held by iodine s neighbour xenon the xe xe bond length is pm as such within the iodine molecule significant electronic interactions occur with the two next nearest neighbours of each atom and these interactions give rise in bulk iodine to a shiny appearance and semiconducting properties iodine is a two dimensional semiconductor with a band gap of ev kj mol it is a semiconductor in the plane of its crystalline layers and an insulator in the perpendicular direction isotopes of the thirty seven known isotopes of iodine only one occurs in nature iodine the others are radioactive and have half lives too short to be primordial as such iodine is both monoisotopic and mononuclidic and its atomic weight is known to great precision as it is a constant of nature the longest lived of the radioactive isotopes of iodine is iodine which has a half life of million years decaying via beta decay to stable xenon some iodine was formed along with iodine before the formation of the solar system but it has by now completely decayed away making it an extinct radionuclide that is nevertheless still useful in dating the history of the early solar system or very old groundwaters due to its mobility in the environment its former presence may be determined from an excess of its daughter xenon traces of iodine still exist today as it is also a cosmogenic nuclide formed from cosmic ray spallation of atmospheric xenon these traces make up to of all terrestrial iodine it also occurs from open air nuclear testing and is not hazardous because of its very long half life the longest of all fission products at the peak of thermonuclear testing in the s and s iodine still made up only about of all terrestrial iodine excited states of iodine and iodine are often used in m ssbauer spectroscopy the other iodine radioisotopes have much shorter half lives no longer than days some of them have medical applications involving the thyroid gland where the iodine that enters the body is stored and concentrated iodine has a half life of thirteen hours and decays by electron capture to tellurium emitting gamma radiation it is used in nuclear medicine imaging including single photon emission computed tomography spect and x ray computed tomography x ray ct scans iodine has a half life of fifty nine days decaying by electron capture to tellurium and emitting low energy gamma radiation the second longest lived iodine radioisotope it has uses in biological assays nuclear medicine imaging and in radiation therapy as brachytherapy to treat a number of conditions including prostate cancer uveal melanomas and brain tumours finally iodine with a half life of eight days beta decays to an excited state of stable xenon that then converts to the ground state by emitting gamma radiation it is a common fission product and thus is present in high levels in radioactive fallout it may then be absorbed through contaminated food and will also accumulate in the thyroid as it decays it may cause damage to the thyroid the primary risk from exposure to high levels of iodine is the chance occurrence of radiogenic thyroid cancer in later life other risks include the possibility of non cancerous growths and thyroiditis the usual means of protection against the negative effects of iodine is by saturating the thyroid gland with stable iodine in the form of potassium iodide tablets taken daily for optimal prophylaxis however iodine may also be used for medicinal purposes in radiation therapy for this very reason when tissue destruction is desired after iodine uptake by the tissue iodine is also used as a radioactive tracer chemistry and compounds iodine is quite reactive but it is much less reactive than the other halogens for example while chlorine gas will halogenate carbon monoxide nitric oxide and sulfur dioxide to phosgene nitrosyl chloride and sulfuryl chloride respectively iodine will not do so furthermore iodination of metals tends to result in lower oxidation states than chlorination or bromination for example rhenium metal reacts with chlorine to form rhenium hexachloride but with bromine it forms only rhenium pentabromide and iodine can achieve only rhenium tetraiodide by the same token however since iodine has the lowest ionisation energy among the halogens and is the most easily oxidised of them it has a more significant cationic chemistry and its higher oxidation states are rather more stable than those of bromine and chlorine for example in iodine heptafluoride charge transfer complexes the iodine molecule i dissolves in ccl and aliphatic hydrocarbons to give bright violet solutions in these solvents the absorption band maximum occurs in the nm region and is assigned to a to transition when i reacts with lewis bases in these solvents a blue shift in i peak is seen and the new peak nm arises that is due to the formation of adducts which are referred to as charge transfer complexes hydrogen iodide the simplest compound of iodine is hydrogen iodide hi it is a colourless gas that reacts with oxygen to give water and iodine although it is useful in iodination reactions in the laboratory it does not have large scale industrial uses unlike the other hydrogen halides commercially it is usually made by reacting iodine with hydrogen sulfide or hydrazine i n h h o hi n at room temperature it is a colourless gas like all of the hydrogen halides except hydrogen fluoride since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative iodine atom it melts at c and boils at c it is an endothermic compound that can exothermically dissociate at room temperature although the process is very slow unless a catalyst is present the reaction between hydrogen and iodine at room temperature to give hydrogen iodide does not proceed to completion the h i bond dissociation energy is likewise the smallest of the hydrogen halides at kj mol aqueous hydrogen iodide is known as hydroiodic acid which is a strong acid hydrogen iodide is exceptionally soluble in water one litre of water will dissolve litres of hydrogen iodide and the saturated solution has only four water molecules per molecule of hydrogen iodide commercial so called concentrated hydroiodic acid usually contains hi by mass the solution forms an azeotrope with boiling point c at g hi per g solution hence hydroiodic acid cannot be concentrated past this point by evaporation of water unlike hydrogen fluoride anhydrous liquid hydrogen iodide is difficult to work with as a solvent because its boiling point is low it has a small liquid range its dielectric constant is low and it does not dissociate appreciably into h i and hi ions the latter in any case are much less stable than the bifluoride ions hf due to the very weak hydrogen bonding between hydrogen and iodine though its salts with very large and weakly polarising cations such as cs and nr r me et bun may still be isolated anhydrous hydrogen iodide is a poor solvent able to dissolve only small molecular compounds such as nitrosyl chloride and phenol or salts with very low lattice energies such as tetraalkylammonium halides other binary iodides nearly all elements in the periodic table form binary iodides the exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions the noble gases extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation many of the heaviest elements beyond bismuth and having an electronegativity higher than iodine s oxygen nitrogen and the first three halogens so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not iodides but rather oxides nitrides or halides of iodine nonetheless nitrogen triiodide is named as an iodide as it is analogous to the other nitrogen trihalides given the large size of the iodide anion and iodine s weak oxidising power high oxidation states are difficult to achieve in binary iodides the maximum known being in the pentaiodides of niobium tantalum and protactinium iodides can be made by reaction of an element or its oxide hydroxide or carbonate with hydroiodic acid and then dehydrated by mildly high temperatures combined with either low pressure or anhydrous hydrogen iodide gas these methods work best when the iodide product is stable to hydrolysis otherwise the possibilities include high temperature oxidative iodination of the element with iodine or hydrogen iodide high temperature iodination of a metal oxide or other halide by iodine a volatile metal halide carbon tetraiodide or an organic iodide for example molybdenum iv oxide reacts with aluminium iii iodide at c to give molybdenum ii iodide an example involving halogen exchange is given below involving the reaction of tantalum v chloride with excess aluminium iii iodide at c to give tantalum v iodide tacl ali excess tai alcl displaystyle ce tacl underset excess ali tai alcl lower iodides may be produced either through thermal decomposition or disproportionation or by reducing the higher iodide with hydrogen or a metal for example tai ta c c thermal gradient ta i displaystyle ce tai ta text thermal gradient ce circ c circ c ta i most metal iodides with the metal in low oxidation states to are ionic nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular iodides as do metals in high oxidation states from and above both ionic and covalent iodides are known for metals in oxidation state e g scandium iodide is mostly ionic but aluminium iodide is not ionic iodides min tend to have the lowest melting and boiling points among the halides mxn of the same element because the electrostatic forces of attraction between the cations and anions are weakest for the large iodide anion in contrast covalent iodides tend to instead have the highest melting and boiling points among the halides of the same element since iodine is the most polarisable of the halogens and having the most electrons among them can contribute the most to van der waals forces naturally exceptions abound in intermediate iodides where one trend gives way to the other similarly solubilities in water of predominantly ionic iodides e g potassium and calcium are the greatest among ionic halides of that element while those of covalent iodides e g silver are the lowest of that element in particular silver iodide is very insoluble in water and its formation is often used as a qualitative test for iodine iodine halides the halogens form many binary diamagnetic interhalogen compounds with stoichiometries xy xy xy and xy where x is heavier than y and iodine is no exception iodine forms all three possible diatomic interhalogens a trifluoride and trichloride as well as a pentafluoride and exceptionally among the halogens a heptafluoride numerous cationic and anionic derivatives are also characterised such as the wine red or bright orange compounds of icl and the dark brown or purplish black compounds of i cl apart from these some pseudohalides are also known such as cyanogen iodide icn iodine thiocyanate iscn and iodine azide in iodine monofluoride if is unstable at room temperature and disproportionates very readily and irreversibly to iodine and iodine pentafluoride and thus cannot be obtained pure it can be synthesised from the reaction of iodine with fluorine gas in trichlorofluoromethane at c with iodine trifluoride in trichlorofluoromethane at c or with silver i fluoride at c iodine monochloride icl and iodine monobromide ibr on the other hand are moderately stable the former a volatile red brown compound was discovered independently by joseph louis gay lussac and humphry davy in not long after the discoveries of chlorine and iodine and it mimics the intermediate halogen bromine so well that justus von liebig was misled into mistaking bromine which he had found for iodine monochloride iodine monochloride and iodine monobromide may be prepared simply by reacting iodine with chlorine or bromine at room temperature and purified by fractional crystallisation both are quite reactive and attack even platinum and gold though not boron carbon cadmium lead zirconium niobium molybdenum and tungsten their reaction with organic compounds depends on conditions iodine chloride vapour tends to chlorinate phenol and salicyclic acid since when iodine chloride undergoes homolytic dissociation chlorine and iodine are produced and the former is more reactive however iodine chloride in tetrachloromethane solution results in iodination being the main reaction since now heterolytic fission of the i cl bond occurs and i attacks phenol as an electrophile however iodine monobromide tends to brominate phenol even in tetrachloromethane solution because it tends to dissociate into its elements in solution and bromine is more reactive than iodine when liquid iodine monochloride and iodine monobromide dissociate into i x and ix anions x cl br thus they are significant conductors of electricity and can be used as ionising solvents iodine trifluoride if is an unstable yellow solid that decomposes above c it is thus little known it is difficult to produce because fluorine gas would tend to oxidise iodine all the way to the pentafluoride reaction at low temperature with xenon difluoride is necessary iodine trichloride which exists in the solid state as the planar dimer i cl is a bright yellow solid synthesised by reacting iodine with liquid chlorine at c caution is necessary during purification because it easily dissociates to iodine monochloride and chlorine and hence can act as a strong chlorinating agent liquid iodine trichloride conducts electricity possibly indicating dissociation to icl and icl ions iodine pentafluoride if a colourless volatile liquid is the most thermodynamically stable iodine fluoride and can be made by reacting iodine with fluorine gas at room temperature it is a fluorinating agent but is mild enough to store in glass apparatus again slight electrical conductivity is present in the liquid state because of dissociation to if and if the pentagonal bipyramidal iodine heptafluoride if is an extremely powerful fluorinating agent behind only chlorine trifluoride chlorine pentafluoride and bromine pentafluoride among the interhalogens it reacts with almost all the elements even at low temperatures fluorinates pyrex glass to form iodine vii oxyfluoride iof and sets carbon monoxide on fire iodine oxides and oxoacids iodine oxides are the most stable of all the halogen oxides because of the strong i o bonds resulting from the large electronegativity difference between iodine and oxygen and they have been known for the longest time the stable white hygroscopic iodine pentoxide i o has been known since its formation in by gay lussac and davy it is most easily made by the dehydration of iodic acid hio of which it is the anhydride it will quickly oxidise carbon monoxide completely to carbon dioxide at room temperature and is thus a useful reagent in determining carbon monoxide concentration it also oxidises nitrogen oxide ethylene and hydrogen sulfide it reacts with sulfur trioxide and peroxydisulfuryl difluoride s o f to form salts of the iodyl cation io and is reduced by concentrated sulfuric acids to iodosyl salts involving io it may be fluorinated by fluorine bromine trifluoride sulfur tetrafluoride or chloryl fluoride resulting iodine pentafluoride which also reacts with iodine pentoxide giving iodine v oxyfluoride iof a few other less stable oxides are known notably i o and i o their structures have not been determined but reasonable guesses are iiii ivo and io io respectively more important are the four oxoacids hypoiodous acid hio iodous acid hio iodic acid hio and periodic acid hio or h io when iodine dissolves in aqueous solution the following reactions occur hypoiodous acid is unstable to disproportionation the hypoiodite ions thus formed disproportionate immediately to give iodide and iodate iodous acid and iodite are even less stable and exist only as a fleeting intermediate in the oxidation of iodide to iodate if at all iodates are by far the most important of these compounds which can be made by oxidising alkali metal iodides with oxygen at c and high pressure or by oxidising iodine with chlorates unlike chlorates which disproportionate very slowly to form chloride and perchlorate iodates are stable to disproportionation in both acidic and alkaline solutions from these salts of most metals can be obtained iodic acid is most easily made by oxidation of an aqueous iodine suspension by electrolysis or fuming nitric acid iodate has the weakest oxidising power of the halates but reacts the quickest many periodates are known including not only the expected tetrahedral io but also square pyramidal io octahedral orthoperiodate io io oh i o oh and i o they are usually made by oxidising alkaline sodium iodate electrochemically with lead iv oxide as the anode or by chlorine gas io oh io h o e io oh cl io cl h othey are thermodymically and kinetically powerful oxidising agents quickly oxidising mn to mno and cleaving glycols diketones ketols aminoalcohols and diamines orthoperiodate especially stabilises high oxidation states among metals because of its very high negative charge of orthoperiodic acid h io is stable and dehydrates at c in a vacuum to metaperiodic acid hio attempting to go further does not result in the nonexistent iodine heptoxide i o but rather iodine pentoxide and oxygen periodic acid may be protonated by sulfuric acid to give the i oh cation isoelectronic to te oh and sb oh and giving salts with bisulfate and sulfate polyiodine compounds when iodine dissolves in strong acids such as fuming sulfuric acid a bright blue paramagnetic solution including i cations is formed a solid salt of the diiodine cation may be obtained by oxidising iodine with antimony pentafluoride i sbf so c i sb f sbf the salt i sb f is dark blue and the blue tantalum analogue i ta f is also known whereas the i i bond length in i is pm that in i is only pm as the missing electron in the latter has been removed from an antibonding orbital making the bond stronger and hence shorter in fluorosulfuric acid solution deep blue i reversibly dimerises below c forming red rectangular diamagnetic i other polyiodine cations are not as well characterised including bent dark brown or black i and centrosymmetric c h green or black i known in the asf and alcl salts among others the only important polyiodide anion in aqueous solution is linear triiodide i its formation explains why the solubility of iodine in water may be increased by the addition of potassium iodide solution i i i keq at c many other polyiodides may be found when solutions containing iodine and iodide crystallise such as i i i and i whose salts with large weakly polarising cations such as cs may be isolated organoiodine compounds organoiodine compounds have been fundamental in the development of organic synthesis such as in the hofmann elimination of amines the williamson ether synthesis the wurtz coupling reaction and in grignard reagents the carbon iodine bond is a common functional group that forms part of core organic chemistry formally these compounds may be thought of as organic derivatives of the iodide anion the simplest organoiodine compounds alkyl iodides may be synthesised by the reaction of alcohols with phosphorus triiodide these may then be used in nucleophilic substitution reactions or for preparing grignard reagents the c i bond is the weakest of all the carbon halogen bonds due to the minuscule difference in electronegativity between carbon and iodine as such iodide is the best leaving group among the halogens to such an extent that many organoiodine compounds turn yellow when stored over time due to decomposition into elemental iodine as such they are commonly used in organic synthesis because of the easy formation and cleavage of the c i bond they are also significantly denser than the other organohalogen compounds thanks to the high atomic weight of iodine a few organic oxidising agents like the iodanes contain iodine in a higher oxidation state than such as iodoxybenzoic acid a common reagent for the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and iodobenzene dichloride phicl used for the selective chlorination of alkenes and alkynes one of the more well known uses of organoiodine compounds is the so called iodoform test where iodoform chi is produced by the exhaustive iodination of a methyl ketone or another compound capable of being oxidised to a methyl ketone as follows some drawbacks of using organoiodine compounds as compared to organochlorine or organobromine compounds is the greater expense and toxicity of the iodine derivatives since iodine is expensive and organoiodine compounds are stronger alkylating agents for example iodoacetamide and iodoacetic acid denature proteins by irreversibly alkylating cysteine residues and preventing the reformation of disulfide linkages halogen exchange to produce iodoalkanes by the finkelstein reaction is slightly complicated by the fact that iodide is a better leaving group than chloride or bromide the difference is nevertheless small enough that the reaction can be driven to completion by exploiting the differential solubility of halide salts or by using a large excess of the halide salt in the classic finkelstein reaction an alkyl chloride or an alkyl bromide is converted to an alkyl iodide by treatment with a solution of sodium iodide in acetone sodium iodide is soluble in acetone and sodium chloride and sodium bromide are not the reaction is driven toward products by mass action due to the precipitation of the insoluble salt occurrence and production iodine is the least abundant of the stable halogens comprising only parts per million of earth s crustal rocks compare fluorine ppm chlorine ppm bromine ppm among the elements which occur in significant quantities elements and it ranks st in abundance iodide minerals are rare and most deposits that are concentrated enough for economical extraction are iodate minerals instead examples include lautarite ca io and dietzeite ca io cacro these are the minerals that occur as trace impurities in the caliche found in chile whose main product is sodium nitrate in total they can contain at least and at most iodine by mass sodium iodate is extracted from the caliche and reduced to iodide by sodium bisulfite this solution is then reacted with freshly extracted iodate resulting in comproportionation to iodine which may be filtered off the caliche was the main source of iodine in the th century and continues to be important today replacing kelp which is no longer an economically viable source but in the late th century brines emerged as a comparable source the japanese minami kanto gas field east of tokyo and the american anadarko basin gas field in northwest oklahoma are the two largest such sources the brine is hotter than c from the depth of the source the brine is first purified and acidified using sulfuric acid then the iodide present is oxidised to iodine with chlorine an iodine solution is produced but is dilute and must be concentrated air is blown into the solution to evaporate the iodine which is passed into an absorbing tower where sulfur dioxide reduces the iodine the hydrogen iodide hi is reacted with chlorine to precipitate the iodine after filtering and purification the iodine is packed hi cl i hcl i h o so hi h so hi cl i hclthese sources ensure that chile and japan are the largest producers of iodine today alternatively the brine may be treated with silver nitrate to precipitate out iodine as silver iodide which is then decomposed by reaction with iron to form metallic silver and a solution of iron ii iodide the iodine may then be liberated by displacement with chlorine applications about half of all produced iodine goes into various organoiodine compounds another remains as the pure element another is used to form potassium iodide and another for other inorganic iodine compounds among the major uses of iodine compounds are catalysts animal feed supplements stabilisers dyes colourants and pigments pharmaceutical sanitation from tincture of iodine and photography minor uses include smog inhibition cloud seeding and various uses in analytical chemistry chemical analysis the iodide and iodate anions are often used for quantitative volumetric analysis for example in iodometry iodine and starch form a blue complex and this reaction is often used to test for either starch or iodine and as an indicator in iodometry the iodine test for starch is still used to detect counterfeit banknotes printed on starch containing paper the iodine value is the mass of iodine in grams that is consumed by grams of a chemical substance typically fats or oils iodine numbers are often used to determine the amount of unsaturation in fatty acids this unsaturation is in the form of double bonds which react with iodine compounds potassium tetraiodomercurate ii k hgi is also known as nessler s reagent it is often used as a sensitive spot test for ammonia similarly mayer s reagent potassium tetraiodomercurate ii solution is used as a precipitating reagent to test for alkaloids aqueous alkaline iodine solution is used in the iodoform test for methyl ketones spectroscopy the spectrum of the iodine molecule i consists of not exclusively tens of thousands of sharp spectral lines in the wavelength range nm it is therefore a commonly used wavelength reference secondary standard by measuring with a spectroscopic doppler free technique while focusing on one of these lines the hyperfine structure of the iodine molecule reveals itself a line is now resolved such that either components from even rotational quantum numbers jeven or components from odd rotational quantum numbers jodd are measurable cesium iodide and thallium doped sodium iodide are used in crystal scintillators for the detection of gamma rays the efficiency is high and energy dispersive spectroscopy is possible but the resolution is rather poor spacecraft propulsion propulsion systems employing iodine as the propellant can be built more compactly with less mass and cost and operate more efficiently than the gridded ion thrusters that were utilized to propel previous spacecraft such as japan s hayabusa probes esa s goce satellite or nasa s dart mission all of which used xenon as the reaction mass iodine s atomic weight is only less than that of xenon while its first two ionisation energies average less together these make iodine ions a promising substitute use of iodine should allow more widespread application of ion thrust technology particularly with smaller scale space vehicles according to the european space agency this small but potentially disruptive innovation could help to clear the skies of space junk by enabling tiny satellites to self destruct cheaply and easily at the end of their missions by steering themselves into the atmosphere where they would burn up in early the french group thrustme performed an in orbit demonstration of an electric powered ion thruster for spacecraft where iodine was used in lieu of xenon as the source of plasma in order to generate thrust by accelerating ions with an electrostatic field medicine elemental iodine elemental iodine is used as an antiseptic either as the element or as the water soluble triiodide anion i generated in situ by adding iodide to poorly water soluble elemental iodine the reverse chemical reaction makes some free elemental iodine available for antisepsis elemental iodine may also be used to treat iodine deficiency in the alternative iodine may be produced from iodophors which contain iodine complexed with a solubilizing agent the iodide ion may be thought of loosely as the iodophor in triiodide water solutions examples of such preparations include tincture of iodine iodine in ethanol or iodine and sodium iodide in a mixture of ethanol and water lugol s iodine iodine and iodide in water alone forming mostly triiodide unlike tincture of iodine lugol s iodine has a minimised amount of the free iodine i component povidone iodine an iodophor iodine v iodine i and fulvic acid form a clathrate compound iodine molecules are caged by fulvic acid in this host guest complex a water soluble solid stable crystalline complex unlike other iodophors iodine v only contains iodine in molecular i form the antimicrobial action of iodine is quick and works at low concentrations and thus it is used in operating theatres its specific mode of action is unknown it penetrates into microorganisms and attacks particular amino acids such as cysteine and methionine nucleotides and fatty acids ultimately resulting in cell death it also has an antiviral action but nonlipid viruses and parvoviruses are less sensitive than lipid enveloped viruses iodine probably attacks surface proteins of enveloped viruses and it may also destabilise membrane fatty acids by reacting with unsaturated carbon bonds other formulations in medicine a saturated solution of potassium iodide is used to treat acute thyrotoxicosis it is also used to block uptake of iodine in the thyroid gland see isotopes section above when this isotope is used as part of radiopharmaceuticals such as iobenguane that are not targeted to the thyroid or thyroid type tissues iodine usually as iodide is a component of nuclear fallout and is particularly dangerous owing to the thyroid gland s propensity to concentrate ingested iodine and retain it for periods longer than this isotope s radiological half life of eight days for this reason people at risk of exposure to environmental radioactive iodine iodine in fallout may be instructed to take non radioactive potassium iodide tablets the typical adult dose is one mg tablet per hours supplying mg micrograms of ionic iodine the typical daily dose of iodine for normal health is of order micrograms see dietary intake below ingestion of this large dose of non radioactive iodine minimises the uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid gland as an element with high electron density and atomic number iodine absorbs x rays weaker than kev due to the photoelectric effect of the innermost electrons organoiodine compounds are used with intravenous injection as x ray radiocontrast agents this application is often in conjunction with advanced x ray techniques such as angiography and ct scanning at present all water soluble radiocontrast agents rely on iodine others the production of ethylenediamine dihydroiodide provided as a nutritional supplement for livestock consumes a large portion of available iodine another significant use is a catalyst for the production of acetic acid by the monsanto and cativa processes in these technologies which support the world s demand for acetic acid hydroiodic acid converts the methanol feedstock into methyl iodide which undergoes carbonylation hydrolysis of the resulting acetyl iodide regenerates hydroiodic acid and gives acetic acid inorganic iodides find specialised uses titanium zirconium hafnium and thorium are purified by the van arkel de boer process which involves the reversible formation of the tetraiodides of these elements silver iodide is a major ingredient to traditional photographic film thousands of kilograms of silver iodide are used annually for cloud seeding to induce rain the organoiodine compound erythrosine is an important food coloring agent perfluoroalkyl iodides are precursors to important surfactants such as perfluorooctanesulfonic acid the iodine clock reaction in which iodine also serves as a test for starch forming a dark blue complex is a popular educational demonstration experiment and example of a seemingly oscillating reaction it is only the concentration of an intermediate product that oscillates although iodine has widespread roles in many species agents containing it can exert a differential effect upon different species in an agricultural system the growth of all strains of fusarium verticillioides is significantly inhibited by an iodine containing fungistatic aj ec at concentrations that do not harm the crop this might be a less toxic anti fungal agricultural treatment due to its relatively natural chemistry i is used as the radiolabel in investigating which ligands go to which plant pattern recognition receptors prrs biological role iodine is an essential element for life and at atomic number z is the heaviest element commonly needed by living organisms lanthanum and the other lanthanides as well as tungsten with z and uranium with z are used by a few microorganisms it is required for the synthesis of the growth regulating thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine t and t respectively named after their number of iodine atoms a deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of t and t and a concomitant enlargement of the thyroid tissue in an attempt to obtain more iodine causing the disease known as simple goitre the major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine t which has a longer half life than t in humans the ratio of t to t released into the blood is between and t is converted to the active t three to four times more potent than t within cells by deiodinases iodinase these are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine t a and thyronamine t a all three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium containing enzymes thus dietary selenium is essential for t production iodine accounts for of the molecular weight of t and of t fifteen to mg of iodine is concentrated in thyroid tissue and hormones but of all iodine in the body is found in other tissues including mammary glands eyes gastric mucosa fetal thymus cerebro spinal fluid and choroid plexus arterial walls the cervix and salivary glands in the cells of those tissues iodide enters directly by sodium iodide symporter nis the action of iodine in mammary tissue is related to fetal and neonatal development but in the other tissues it is at least partially unknown dietary intake the daily levels of intake recommended by the united states national academy of medicine are between and g for infants up to months g for children up to eight years g for children up to years g for adults g for pregnant women and g for lactation the tolerable upper intake level ul for adults is g day this upper limit was assessed by analyzing the effect of supplementation on thyroid stimulating hormone the thyroid gland needs no more than g day to synthesise the requisite daily amounts of t and t the higher recommended daily allowance levels of iodine seem necessary for optimal function of a number of body systems including lactation gastric mucosa salivary glands brain cells choroid plexus thymus and arterial walls natural sources of dietary iodine include seafood such as fish seaweeds such as kelp and shellfish dairy products and eggs so long as the animals received enough iodine and plants grown on iodine rich soil iodised salt is fortified with iodine in the form of sodium iodide as of the median intake of iodine from food in the united states was to g day for men and to g day for women the general us population has adequate iodine nutrition with women of childbearing age and pregnant women having a possible mild risk of deficiency in japan consumption was considered much higher ranging between g day to g day from dietary seaweed or kombu kelp often in the form of kombu umami extracts for soup stock and potato chips however new studies suggest that japan s consumption is closer to g day the adult ul in japan was last revised to g day in after iodine fortification programs such as iodisation of salt have been implemented some cases of iodine induced hyperthyroidism have been observed so called jod basedow phenomenon the condition seems to occur mainly in people over forty and the risk appears higher when iodine deficiency is severe and the initial rise in iodine intake is high deficiency in areas where there is little iodine in the diet typically remote inland areas and semi arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten iodine deficiency gives rise to hypothyroidism symptoms of which are extreme fatigue goitre mental slowing depression weight gain and low basal body temperatures iodine deficiency is the leading cause of preventable intellectual disability a result that occurs primarily when babies or small children are rendered hypothyroidic by a lack of the element the addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this problem in wealthier nations but iodine deficiency remains a serious public health problem in the developing world today iodine deficiency is also a problem in certain areas of europe information processing fine motor skills and visual problem solving are improved by iodine repletion in moderately iodine deficient children precautions toxicity elemental iodine i is toxic if taken orally undiluted the lethal dose for an adult human is mg kg which is about grams for a human weighing to kg even if experiments on rats demonstrated that these animals could survive after eating a mg kg dose excess iodine can be more cytotoxic in the presence of selenium deficiency iodine supplementation in selenium deficient populations is in theory problematic partly for this reason the toxicity derives from its oxidizing properties through which it denaturates proteins including enzymes elemental iodine is also a skin irritant direct contact with skin can cause damage and solid iodine crystals should be handled with care solutions with high elemental iodine concentration such as tincture of iodine and lugol s solution are capable of causing tissue damage if used in prolonged cleaning or antisepsis similarly liquid povidone iodine betadine trapped against the skin resulted in chemical burns in some reported cases occupational exposure people can be exposed to iodine in the workplace by inhalation ingestion skin contact and eye contact the occupational safety and health administration osha has set the legal limit permissible exposure limit for iodine exposure in the workplace at ppm mg m during an hour workday the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit rel of ppm mg m during an hour workday at levels of ppm iodine is immediately dangerous to life and health allergic reactions some people develop a hypersensitivity to products and foods containing iodine applications of tincture of iodine or betadine can cause rashes sometimes severe parenteral use of iodine based contrast agents see above can cause reactions ranging from a mild rash to fatal anaphylaxis such reactions have led to the misconception widely held even among physicians that some people are allergic to iodine itself even allergies to iodine rich seafood have been so construed in fact there has never been a confirmed report of a true iodine allergy and an allergy to elemental iodine or simple iodide salts is theoretically impossible hypersensitivity reactions to products and foods containing iodine are apparently related to their other molecular components thus a person who has demonstrated an allergy to one food or product containing iodine may not have an allergic reaction to another patients with various food allergies shellfish egg milk etc do not have an increased risk for a contrast medium hypersensitivity as with all medications the patient s allergy history should be questioned and consulted before any containing iodine are administered us dea list i status phosphorus can reduce elemental iodine to hydroiodic acid which is a reagent effective for reducing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine for this reason iodine was designated by the united states drug enforcement administration as a list i precursor chemical under cfr ,53
Xenon,Xe,xenon is a chemical element with the symbol xe and atomic number it is a dense colorless odorless noble gas found in earth s atmosphere in trace amounts although generally unreactive it can undergo a few chemical reactions such as the formation of xenon hexafluoroplatinate the first noble gas compound to be synthesized xenon is used in flash lamps and arc lamps and as a general anesthetic the first excimer laser design used a xenon dimer molecule xe as the lasing medium and the earliest laser designs used xenon flash lamps as pumps xenon is also used to search for hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles and as a propellant for ion thrusters in spacecraft naturally occurring xenon consists of seven stable isotopes and two long lived radioactive isotopes more than unstable xenon isotopes undergo radioactive decay and the isotope ratios of xenon are an important tool for studying the early history of the solar system radioactive xenon is produced by beta decay from iodine a product of nuclear fission and is the most significant and unwanted neutron absorber in nuclear reactors history xenon was discovered in england by the scottish chemist william ramsay and english chemist morris travers in september shortly after their discovery of the elements krypton and neon they found xenon in the residue left over from evaporating components of liquid air ramsay suggested the name xenon for this gas from the greek word x non neuter singular form of x nos meaning foreign er strange r or guest in ramsay estimated the proportion of xenon in the earth s atmosphere to be one part in million during the s american engineer harold edgerton began exploring strobe light technology for high speed photography this led him to the invention of the xenon flash lamp in which light is generated by passing brief electric current through a tube filled with xenon gas in edgerton was able to generate flashes as brief as one microsecond with this method in american physician albert r behnke jr began exploring the causes of drunkenness in deep sea divers he tested the effects of varying the breathing mixtures on his subjects and discovered that this caused the divers to perceive a change in depth from his results he deduced that xenon gas could serve as an anesthetic although russian toxicologist nikolay v lazarev apparently studied xenon anesthesia in the first published report confirming xenon anesthesia was in by american medical researcher john h lawrence who experimented on mice xenon was first used as a surgical anesthetic in by american anesthesiologist stuart c cullen who successfully used it with two patients xenon and the other noble gases were for a long time considered to be completely chemically inert and not able to form compounds however while teaching at the university of british columbia neil bartlett discovered that the gas platinum hexafluoride ptf was a powerful oxidizing agent that could oxidize oxygen gas o to form dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate o ptf since o kj mol and xenon kj mol have almost the same first ionization potential bartlett realized that platinum hexafluoride might also be able to oxidize xenon on march he mixed the two gases and produced the first known compound of a noble gas xenon hexafluoroplatinate bartlett thought its composition to be xe ptf but later work revealed that it was probably a mixture of various xenon containing salts since then many other xenon compounds have been discovered in addition to some compounds of the noble gases argon krypton and radon including argon fluorohydride harf krypton difluoride krf and radon fluoride by more than xenon compounds were known in november ibm scientists demonstrated a technology capable of manipulating individual atoms the program called ibm in atoms used a scanning tunneling microscope to arrange individual xenon atoms on a substrate of chilled crystal of nickel to spell out the three letter company initialism it was the first time atoms had been precisely positioned on a flat surface characteristics xenon has atomic number that is its nucleus contains protons at standard temperature and pressure pure xenon gas has a density of kg m about times the density of the earth s atmosphere at sea level kg m as a liquid xenon has a density of up to g ml with the density maximum occurring at the triple point liquid xenon has a high polarizability due to its large atomic volume and thus is an excellent solvent it can dissolve hydrocarbons biological molecules and even water under the same conditions the density of solid xenon g cm is greater than the average density of granite g cm under gigapascals of pressure xenon forms a metallic phase solid xenon changes from face centered cubic fcc to hexagonal close packed hcp crystal phase under pressure and begins to turn metallic at about gpa with no noticeable volume change in the hcp phase it is completely metallic at gpa when metallized xenon appears sky blue because it absorbs red light and transmits other visible frequencies such behavior is unusual for a metal and is explained by the relatively small width of the electron bands in that state liquid or solid xenon nanoparticles can be formed at room temperature by implanting xe ions into a solid matrix many solids have lattice constants smaller than solid xe this results in compression of the implanted xe to pressures that may be sufficient for its liquefaction or solidification xenon is a member of the zero valence elements that are called noble or inert gases it is inert to most common chemical reactions such as combustion for example because the outer valence shell contains eight electrons this produces a stable minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound in a gas filled tube xenon emits a blue or lavenderish glow when excited by electrical discharge xenon emits a band of emission lines that span the visual spectrum but the most intense lines occur in the region of blue light producing the coloration occurrence and production xenon is a trace gas in earth s atmosphere occurring at a volume fraction of nl l parts per billion or approximately part per million it is also found as a component of gases emitted from some mineral springs given a total mass of the atmosphere of kilograms lb the atmosphere contains on the order of gigatonnes long tons short tons of xenon in total when taking the average molar mass of the atmosphere as g mol which is equivalent to some mass ppb commercial xenon is obtained commercially as a by product of the separation of air into oxygen and nitrogen after this separation generally performed by fractional distillation in a double column plant the liquid oxygen produced will contain small quantities of krypton and xenon by additional fractional distillation the liquid oxygen may be enriched to contain of a krypton xenon mixture which is extracted either by adsorption onto silica gel or by distillation finally the krypton xenon mixture may be separated into krypton and xenon by further distillation worldwide production of xenon in was estimated at cubic metres cu ft at a density of grams per litre lb cu in this is equivalent to roughly to tonnes to long tons to short tons because of its scarcity xenon is much more expensive than the lighter noble gases approximate prices for the purchase of small quantities in europe in were l g for xenon l g for krypton and l g for neon while the much more plentiful argon which makes up over by volume of earth s atmosphere costs less than a cent per liter solar system within the solar system the nucleon fraction of xenon is for an abundance of approximately one part in thousand of the total mass xenon is relatively rare in the sun s atmosphere on earth and in asteroids and comets the abundance of xenon in the atmosphere of planet jupiter is unusually high about times that of the sun this abundance remains unexplained but may have been caused by an early and rapid buildup of planetesimals small subplanetary bodies before the heating of the presolar disk otherwise xenon would not have been trapped in the planetesimal ices the problem of the low terrestrial xenon may be explained by covalent bonding of xenon to oxygen within quartz reducing the outgassing of xenon into the atmosphere stellar unlike the lower mass noble gases the normal stellar nucleosynthesis process inside a star does not form xenon elements more massive than iron consume energy through fusion and the synthesis of xenon represents no energy gain for a star instead xenon is formed during supernova explosions in classical nova explosions by the slow neutron capture process s process in red giant stars that have exhausted their core hydrogen and entered the asymptotic giant branch and from radioactive decay for example by beta decay of extinct iodine and spontaneous fission of thorium uranium and plutonium nuclear fission xenon is a notable neutron poison with a high fission product yield as it is relatively short lived it decays at the same rate it is produced during steady operation of a nuclear reactor however if power is reduced or the reactor is scramed less xenon is destroyed than is produced from the beta decay of its parent nuclides this phenomenon called xenon poisoning can cause significant problems in restarting a reactor after a scram or increasing power after it had been reduced and it was one of several contributing factors in the chernobyl nuclear accident stable or extremely long lived isotopes of xenon are also produced in appreciable quantities in nuclear fission xenon is produced when xenon undergoes neutron capture before it can decay the ratio of xenon to xenon or its decay products can give hints as to the power history of a given reactor and the absence of xenon is a fingerprint for nuclear explosions as xenon is not produced directly but as a product of successive beta decays and thus it can t absorb any neutrons in a nuclear explosion which occurs in fractions of a second the stable isotope xenon has a fission product yield of over in the thermal neutron fission of u which means that stable or nearly stable xenon isotopes have a higher mass fraction in spent nuclear fuel which is about fission products than it does in air however there is as of no commercial effort to extract xenon from spent fuel during nuclear reprocessing isotopes naturally occurring xenon is composed of seven stable isotopes xe xe and xe the isotopes xe and xe are predicted by theory to undergo double beta decay but this has never been observed so they are considered stable in addition more than unstable isotopes have been studied the longest lived of these isotopes are the primordial xe which undergoes double electron capture with a half life of yr and xe which undergoes double beta decay with a half life of yr xe is produced by beta decay of i which has a half life of million years mxe xe mxe and xe are some of the fission products of u and pu and are used to detect and monitor nuclear explosions nuclear spin nuclei of two of the stable isotopes of xenon xe and xe have non zero intrinsic angular momenta nuclear spins suitable for nuclear magnetic resonance the nuclear spins can be aligned beyond ordinary polarization levels by means of circularly polarized light and rubidium vapor the resulting spin polarization of xenon nuclei can surpass of its maximum possible value greatly exceeding the thermal equilibrium value dictated by paramagnetic statistics typically of the maximum value at room temperature even in the strongest magnets such non equilibrium alignment of spins is a temporary condition and is called hyperpolarization the process of hyperpolarizing the xenon is called optical pumping although the process is different from pumping a laser because a xe nucleus has a spin of and therefore a zero electric quadrupole moment the xe nucleus does not experience any quadrupolar interactions during collisions with other atoms and the hyperpolarization persists for long periods even after the engendering light and vapor have been removed spin polarization of xe can persist from several seconds for xenon atoms dissolved in blood to several hours in the gas phase and several days in deeply frozen solid xenon in contrast xe has a nuclear spin value of and a nonzero quadrupole moment and has t relaxation times in the millisecond and second ranges from fission some radioactive isotopes of xenon for example xe and xe are produced by neutron irradiation of fissionable material within nuclear reactors xe is of considerable significance in the operation of nuclear fission reactors xe has a huge cross section for thermal neutrons barns and operates as a neutron absorber or poison that can slow or stop the chain reaction after a period of operation this was discovered in the earliest nuclear reactors built by the american manhattan project for plutonium production however the designers had made provisions in the design to increase the reactor s reactivity the number of neutrons per fission that go on to fission other atoms of nuclear fuel xe reactor poisoning was a major factor in the chernobyl disaster a shutdown or decrease of power of a reactor can result in buildup of xe with reactor operation going into a condition known as the iodine pit under adverse conditions relatively high concentrations of radioactive xenon isotopes may emanate from cracked fuel rods or fissioning of uranium in cooling water isotope ratios of xenon produced in natural nuclear fission reactors at oklo in gabon reveal the reactor properties during chain reaction that took place about billion years ago cosmic processes because xenon is a tracer for two parent isotopes xenon isotope ratios in meteorites are a powerful tool for studying the formation of the solar system the iodine xenon method of dating gives the time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and the condensation of a solid object from the solar nebula in physicist john h reynolds discovered that certain meteorites contained an isotopic anomaly in the form of an overabundance of xenon he inferred that this was a decay product of radioactive iodine this isotope is produced slowly by cosmic ray spallation and nuclear fission but is produced in quantity only in supernova explosions because the half life of i is comparatively short on a cosmological time scale million years this demonstrated that only a short time had passed between the supernova and the time the meteorites had solidified and trapped the i these two events supernova and solidification of gas cloud were inferred to have happened during the early history of the solar system because the i isotope was likely generated shortly before the solar system was formed seeding the solar gas cloud with isotopes from a second source this supernova source may also have caused collapse of the solar gas cloud in a similar way xenon isotopic ratios such as xe xe and xe xe are a powerful tool for understanding planetary differentiation and early outgassing for example the atmosphere of mars shows a xenon abundance similar to that of earth parts per million but mars shows a greater abundance of xe than the earth or the sun since this isotope is generated by radioactive decay the result may indicate that mars lost most of its primordial atmosphere possibly within the first million years after the planet was formed in another example excess xe found in carbon dioxide well gases from new mexico is believed to be from the decay of mantle derived gases from soon after earth s formation compounds after neil bartlett s discovery in that xenon can form chemical compounds a large number of xenon compounds have been discovered and described almost all known xenon compounds contain the electronegative atoms fluorine or oxygen the chemistry of xenon in each oxidation state is analogous to that of the neighboring element iodine in the immediately lower oxidation state halides three fluorides are known xef xef and xef xef is theorized to be unstable these are the starting points for the synthesis of almost all xenon compounds the solid crystalline difluoride xef is formed when a mixture of fluorine and xenon gases is exposed to ultraviolet light the ultraviolet component of ordinary daylight is sufficient long term heating of xef at high temperatures under an nif catalyst yields xef pyrolysis of xef in the presence of naf yields high purity xef the xenon fluorides behave as both fluoride acceptors and fluoride donors forming salts that contain such cations as xef and xe f and anions such as xef xef and xef the green paramagnetic xe is formed by the reduction of xef by xenon gas xef also forms coordination complexes with transition metal ions more than such complexes have been synthesized and characterized whereas the xenon fluorides are well characterized the other halides are not known with the exception of xecl and xecl xenon dichloride formed by the high frequency irradiation of a mixture of xenon fluorine and silicon or carbon tetrachloride is reported to be an endothermic colorless crystalline compound that decomposes into the elements at c however xecl may be merely a van der waals molecule of weakly bound xe atoms and cl molecules and not a real compound theoretical calculations indicate that the linear molecule xecl is less stable than the van der waals complex xenon tetrachloride is more unstable that it cannot be synthesized by chemical reactions it was created by radioactive icl decay oxides and oxohalides three oxides of xenon are known xenon trioxide xeo and xenon tetroxide xeo both of which are dangerously explosive and powerful oxidizing agents and xenon dioxide xeo which was reported in with a coordination number of four xeo forms when xenon tetrafluoride is poured over ice its crystal structure may allow it to replace silicon in silicate minerals the xeoo cation has been identified by infrared spectroscopy in solid argon xenon does not react with oxygen directly the trioxide is formed by the hydrolysis of xef xef h o xeo hfxeo is weakly acidic dissolving in alkali to form unstable xenate salts containing the hxeo anion these unstable salts easily disproportionate into xenon gas and perxenate salts containing the xeo anion barium perxenate when treated with concentrated sulfuric acid yields gaseous xenon tetroxide ba xeo h so baso h o xeo to prevent decomposition the xenon tetroxide thus formed is quickly cooled into a pale yellow solid it explodes above c into xenon and oxygen gas but is otherwise stable a number of xenon oxyfluorides are known including xeof xeof xeo f and xeo f xeof is formed by reacting of with xenon gas at low temperatures it may also be obtained by partial hydrolysis of xef it disproportionates at c into xef and xeo f xeof is formed by the partial hydrolysis of xef or the reaction of xef with sodium perxenate na xeo the latter reaction also produces a small amount of xeo f xeof reacts with csf to form the xeof anion while xeof reacts with the alkali metal fluorides kf rbf and csf to form the xeof anion other compounds xenon can be directly bonded to a less electronegative element than fluorine or oxygen particularly carbon electron withdrawing groups such as groups with fluorine substitution are necessary to stabilize these compounds numerous such compounds have been characterized including c f xe n c ch where c f is the pentafluorophenyl group c f xe c f xe c n c f xe f c f xe cl c f c c xe ch c c c xe c f xef c f xe cl other compounds containing xenon bonded to a less electronegative element include f xe n so f and f xe bf the latter is synthesized from dioxygenyl tetrafluoroborate o bf at c an unusual ion containing xenon is the tetraxenonogold ii cation auxe which contains xe au bonds this ion occurs in the compound auxe sb f and is remarkable in having direct chemical bonds between two notoriously unreactive atoms xenon and gold with xenon acting as a transition metal ligand the compound xe sb f contains a xe xe bond the longest element element bond known pm in m r s nen and co workers scientists at the university of helsinki in finland announced the preparation of xenon dihydride hxeh and later xenon hydride hydroxide hxeoh hydroxenoacetylene hxecch and other xe containing molecules in khriachtchev et al reported the preparation of hxeoxeh by the photolysis of water within a cryogenic xenon matrix deuterated molecules hxeod and dxeoh have also been produced clathrates and excimers in addition to compounds where xenon forms a chemical bond xenon can form clathrates substances where xenon atoms or pairs are trapped by the crystalline lattice of another compound one example is xenon hydrate xe h o where xenon atoms occupy vacancies in a lattice of water molecules this clathrate has a melting point of c the deuterated version of this hydrate has also been produced another example is xenon hydride xe h in which xenon pairs dimers are trapped inside solid hydrogen such clathrate hydrates can occur naturally under conditions of high pressure such as in lake vostok underneath the antarctic ice sheet clathrate formation can be used to fractionally distill xenon argon and krypton xenon can also form endohedral fullerene compounds where a xenon atom is trapped inside a fullerene molecule the xenon atom trapped in the fullerene can be observed by xe nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy through the sensitive chemical shift of the xenon atom to its environment chemical reactions on the fullerene molecule can be analyzed these observations are not without caveat however because the xenon atom has an electronic influence on the reactivity of the fullerene when xenon atoms are in the ground energy state they repel each other and will not form a bond when xenon atoms becomes energized however they can form an excimer excited dimer until the electrons return to the ground state this entity is formed because the xenon atom tends to complete the outermost electronic shell by adding an electron from a neighboring xenon atom the typical lifetime of a xenon excimer is nanoseconds and the decay releases photons with wavelengths of about and nm xenon can also form excimers with other elements such as the halogens bromine chlorine and fluorine applications although xenon is rare and relatively expensive to extract from the earth s atmosphere it has a number of applications illumination and optics gas discharge lamps xenon is used in light emitting devices called xenon flash lamps used in photographic flashes and stroboscopic lamps to excite the active medium in lasers which then generate coherent light and occasionally in bactericidal lamps the first solid state laser invented in was pumped by a xenon flash lamp and lasers used to power inertial confinement fusion are also pumped by xenon flash lamps continuous short arc high pressure xenon arc lamps have a color temperature closely approximating noon sunlight and are used in solar simulators that is the chromaticity of these lamps closely approximates a heated black body radiator at the temperature of the sun first introduced in the s these lamps replaced the shorter lived carbon arc lamps in movie projectors they are also employed in typical mm imax and digital film projection systems they are an excellent source of short wavelength ultraviolet radiation and have intense emissions in the near infrared used in some night vision systems xenon is used as a starter gas in metal halide lamps for automotive hid headlights and high end tactical flashlights the individual cells in a plasma display contain a mixture of xenon and neon ionized with electrodes the interaction of this plasma with the electrodes generates ultraviolet photons which then excite the phosphor coating on the front of the display xenon is used as a starter gas in high pressure sodium lamps it has the lowest thermal conductivity and lowest ionization potential of all the non radioactive noble gases as a noble gas it does not interfere with the chemical reactions occurring in the operating lamp the low thermal conductivity minimizes thermal losses in the lamp while in the operating state and the low ionization potential causes the breakdown voltage of the gas to be relatively low in the cold state which allows the lamp to be more easily started lasers in a group of researchers at bell laboratories discovered laser action in xenon and later found that the laser gain was improved by adding helium to the lasing medium the first excimer laser used a xenon dimer xe energized by a beam of electrons to produce stimulated emission at an ultraviolet wavelength of nm xenon chloride and xenon fluoride have also been used in excimer or more accurately exciplex lasers medical anesthesia xenon has been used as a general anesthetic but it is more expensive than conventional anesthetics xenon interacts with many different receptors and ion channels and like many theoretically multi modal inhalation anesthetics these interactions are likely complementary xenon is a high affinity glycine site nmda receptor antagonist however xenon is different from certain other nmda receptor antagonists in that it is not neurotoxic and it inhibits the neurotoxicity of ketamine and nitrous oxide n o while actually producing neuroprotective effects unlike ketamine and nitrous oxide xenon does not stimulate a dopamine efflux in the nucleus accumbens like nitrous oxide and cyclopropane xenon activates the two pore domain potassium channel trek a related channel task also implicated in the actions of inhalation anesthetics is insensitive to xenon xenon inhibits nicotinic acetylcholine receptors which contribute to spinally mediated analgesia xenon is an effective inhibitor of plasma membrane ca atpase xenon inhibits ca atpase by binding to a hydrophobic pore within the enzyme and preventing the enzyme from assuming active conformations xenon is a competitive inhibitor of the serotonin ht receptor while neither anesthetic nor antinociceptive this reduces anesthesia emergent nausea and vomiting xenon has a minimum alveolar concentration mac of at age making it more potent than n o as an anesthetic thus it can be used with oxygen in concentrations that have a lower risk of hypoxia unlike nitrous oxide xenon is not a greenhouse gas and is viewed as environmentally friendly though recycled in modern systems xenon vented to the atmosphere is only returning to its original source without environmental impact neuroprotectant xenon induces robust cardioprotection and neuroprotection through a variety of mechanisms through its influence on ca k katp hif and nmda antagonism xenon is neuroprotective when administered before during and after ischemic insults xenon is a high affinity antagonist at the nmda receptor glycine site xenon is cardioprotective in ischemia reperfusion conditions by inducing pharmacologic non ischemic preconditioning xenon is cardioprotective by activating pkc epsilon and downstream p mapk xenon mimics neuronal ischemic preconditioning by activating atp sensitive potassium channels xenon allosterically reduces atp mediated channel activation inhibition independently of the sulfonylurea receptor subunit increasing katp open channel time and frequency sports doping inhaling a xenon oxygen mixture activates production of the transcription factor hif alpha which may lead to increased production of erythropoietin the latter hormone is known to increase red blood cell production and athletic performance reportedly doping with xenon inhalation has been used in russia since and perhaps earlier on august the world anti doping agency wada added xenon and argon to the list of prohibited substances and methods although no reliable doping tests for these gases have yet been developed in addition effects of xenon on erythropoietin production in humans have not been demonstrated so far imaging gamma emission from the radioisotope xe of xenon can be used to image the heart lungs and brain for example by means of single photon emission computed tomography xe has also been used to measure blood flow xenon particularly hyperpolarized xe is a useful contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging mri in the gas phase it can image cavities in a porous sample alveoli in lungs or the flow of gases within the lungs because xenon is soluble both in water and in hydrophobic solvents it can image various soft living tissues xenon is currently being used as a visualization agent in mri scans when a patient inhales hyperpolarized xenon ventilation and gas exchange in the lungs can be imaged and quantified unlike xenon xenon is non ionizing and is safe to be inhaled with no adverse effects surgery the xenon chloride excimer laser has certain dermatological uses nmr spectroscopy because of the xenon atom s large flexible outer electron shell the nmr spectrum changes in response to surrounding conditions and can be used to monitor the surrounding chemical circumstances for instance xenon dissolved in water xenon dissolved in hydrophobic solvent and xenon associated with certain proteins can be distinguished by nmr hyperpolarized xenon can be used by surface chemists normally it is difficult to characterize surfaces with nmr because signals from a surface are overwhelmed by signals from the atomic nuclei in the bulk of the sample which are much more numerous than surface nuclei however nuclear spins on solid surfaces can be selectively polarized by transferring spin polarization to them from hyperpolarized xenon gas this makes the surface signals strong enough to measure and distinguish from bulk signals other in nuclear energy studies xenon is used in bubble chambers probes and in other areas where a high molecular weight and inert chemistry is desirable a by product of nuclear weapon testing is the release of radioactive xenon and xenon these isotopes are monitored to ensure compliance with nuclear test ban treaties and to confirm nuclear tests by states such as north korea liquid xenon is used in calorimeters to measure gamma rays and as a detector of hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles or wimps when a wimp collides with a xenon nucleus theory predicts it will impart enough energy to cause ionization and scintillation liquid xenon is useful for these experiments because its density makes dark matter interaction more likely and it permits a quiet detector through self shielding xenon is the preferred propellant for ion propulsion of spacecraft because it has low ionization potential per atomic weight and can be stored as a liquid at near room temperature under high pressure yet easily evaporated to feed the engine xenon is inert environmentally friendly and less corrosive to an ion engine than other fuels such as mercury or caesium xenon was first used for satellite ion engines during the s it was later employed as a propellant for jpl s deep space probe europe s smart spacecraft and for the three ion propulsion engines on nasa s dawn spacecraft chemically the perxenate compounds are used as oxidizing agents in analytical chemistry xenon difluoride is used as an etchant for silicon particularly in the production of microelectromechanical systems mems the anticancer drug fluorouracil can be produced by reacting xenon difluoride with uracil xenon is also used in protein crystallography applied at pressures from to mpa to atm to a protein crystal xenon atoms bind in predominantly hydrophobic cavities often creating a high quality isomorphous heavy atom derivative that can be used for solving the phase problem precautions xenon gas can be safely kept in normal sealed glass or metal containers at standard temperature and pressure however it readily dissolves in most plastics and rubber and will gradually escape from a container sealed with such materials xenon is non toxic although it does dissolve in blood and belongs to a select group of substances that penetrate the blood brain barrier causing mild to full surgical anesthesia when inhaled in high concentrations with oxygen the speed of sound in xenon gas m s is less than that in air because the average velocity of the heavy xenon atoms is less than that of nitrogen and oxygen molecules in air hence xenon vibrates more slowly in the vocal cords when exhaled and produces lowered voice tones low frequency enhanced sounds but the fundamental frequency or pitch doesn t change an effect opposite to the high toned voice produced in helium specifically when the vocal tract is filled with xenon gas its natural resonant frequency becomes lower than when it s filled with air thus the low frequencies of the sound wave produced by the same direct vibration of the vocal cords would be enhanced resulting in a change of the timbre of the sound amplified by the vocal tract like helium xenon does not satisfy the body s need for oxygen and it is both a simple asphyxiant and an anesthetic more powerful than nitrous oxide consequently and because xenon is expensive many universities have prohibited the voice stunt as a general chemistry demonstration the gas sulfur hexafluoride is similar to xenon in molecular weight versus less expensive and though an asphyxiant not toxic or anesthetic it is often substituted in these demonstrations dense gases such as xenon and sulfur hexafluoride can be breathed safely when mixed with at least oxygen xenon at concentration along with oxygen rapidly produces the unconsciousness of general anesthesia and has been used for this as discussed above breathing mixes gases of different densities very effectively and rapidly so that heavier gases are purged along with the oxygen and do not accumulate at the bottom of the lungs there is however a danger associated with any heavy gas in large quantities it may sit invisibly in a container and a person who enters an area filled with an odorless colorless gas may be asphyxiated without warning xenon is rarely used in large enough quantities for this to be a concern though the potential for danger exists any time a tank or container of xenon is kept in an unventilated space water soluble xenon compounds such as monosodium xenate are moderately toxic but have a very short half life of the body intravenously injected xenate is reduced to elemental xenon in about a minute ,54
Cesium,Cs,caesium iupac spelling or cesium in american english is a chemical element with the symbol cs and atomic number it is a soft silvery golden alkali metal with a melting point of c f which makes it one of only five elemental metals that are liquid at or near room temperature caesium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of rubidium and potassium it is pyrophoric and reacts with water even at c f it is the least electronegative element with a value of on the pauling scale it has only one stable isotope caesium caesium is mined mostly from pollucite the element has known isotopes making it along with barium and mercury one of the elements with the most isotopes caesium a fission product is extracted from waste produced by nuclear reactors the german chemist robert bunsen and physicist gustav kirchhoff discovered caesium in by the newly developed method of flame spectroscopy the first small scale applications for caesium were as a getter in vacuum tubes and in photoelectric cells in acting on einstein s proof that the speed of light is the most constant dimension in the universe the international system of units used two specific wave counts from an emission spectrum of caesium to co define the second and the metre since then caesium has been widely used in highly accurate atomic clocks since the s the largest application of the element has been as caesium formate for drilling fluids but it has a range of applications in the production of electricity in electronics and in chemistry the radioactive isotope caesium has a half life of about years and is used in medical applications industrial gauges and hydrology nonradioactive caesium compounds are only mildly toxic but the pure metal s tendency to react explosively with water means that caesium is considered a hazardous material and the radioisotopes present a significant health and ecological hazard in the environment characteristics physical properties of all elements that are solid at room temperature caesium is the softest it has a hardness of mohs it is a very ductile pale metal which darkens in the presence of trace amounts of oxygen when in the presence of mineral oil where it is best kept during transport it loses its metallic lustre and takes on a duller grey appearance it has a melting point of c f making it one of the few elemental metals that are liquid near room temperature mercury is the only stable elemental metal with a known melting point lower than caesium in addition the metal has a rather low boiling point c f the lowest of all metals other than mercury its compounds burn with a blue or violet colour caesium forms alloys with the other alkali metals gold and mercury amalgams at temperatures below c f it does not alloy with cobalt iron molybdenum nickel platinum tantalum or tungsten it forms well defined intermetallic compounds with antimony gallium indium and thorium which are photosensitive it mixes with all the other alkali metals except lithium the alloy with a molar distribution of caesium potassium and sodium has the lowest melting point of any known metal alloy at c f a few amalgams have been studied cshg is black with a purple metallic lustre while cshg is golden coloured also with a metallic lustre the golden colour of caesium comes from the decreasing frequency of light required to excite electrons of the alkali metals as the group is descended for lithium through rubidium this frequency is in the ultraviolet but for caesium it enters the blue violet end of the spectrum in other words the plasmonic frequency of the alkali metals becomes lower from lithium to caesium thus caesium transmits and partially absorbs violet light preferentially while other colours having lower frequency are reflected hence it appears yellowish chemical properties caesium metal is highly reactive and very pyrophoric it ignites spontaneously in air and reacts explosively with water even at low temperatures more so than the other alkali metals first group of the periodic table it reacts with ice at temperatures as low as c f because of this high reactivity caesium metal is classified as a hazardous material it is stored and shipped in dry saturated hydrocarbons such as mineral oil it can be handled only under inert gas such as argon however a caesium water explosion is often less powerful than a sodium water explosion with a similar amount of sodium this is because caesium explodes instantly upon contact with water leaving little time for hydrogen to accumulate caesium can be stored in vacuum sealed borosilicate glass ampoules in quantities of more than about grams oz caesium is shipped in hermetically sealed stainless steel containers the chemistry of caesium is similar to that of other alkali metals in particular rubidium the element above caesium in the periodic table as expected for an alkali metal the only common oxidation state is some slight differences arise from the fact that it has a higher atomic mass and is more electropositive than other nonradioactive alkali metals caesium is the most electropositive chemical element the caesium ion is also larger and less hard than those of the lighter alkali metals compounds most caesium compounds contain the element as the cation cs which binds ionically to a wide variety of anions one noteworthy exception is the caeside anion cs and others are the several suboxides see section on oxides below more recently caesium is predicted to behave as a p block element and capable of forming higher fluorides with higher oxidation states i e csfn with n under high pressure this prediction needs to be validated by further experiments salts of cs are usually colourless unless the anion itself is coloured many of the simple salts are hygroscopic but less so than the corresponding salts of lighter alkali metals the phosphate acetate carbonate halides oxide nitrate and sulfate salts are water soluble its double salts are often less soluble and the low solubility of caesium aluminium sulfate is exploited in refining cs from ores the double salts with antimony such as cssbcl bismuth cadmium copper iron and lead are also poorly soluble caesium hydroxide csoh is hygroscopic and strongly basic it rapidly etches the surface of semiconductors such as silicon csoh has been previously regarded by chemists as the strongest base reflecting the relatively weak attraction between the large cs ion and oh it is indeed the strongest arrhenius base however a number of compounds such as n butyllithium sodium amide sodium hydride caesium hydride etc which cannot be dissolved in water as reacting violently with it but rather only used in some anhydrous polar aprotic solvents are far more basic on the basis of the br nsted lowry acid base theory a stoichiometric mixture of caesium and gold will react to form yellow caesium auride cs au upon heating the auride anion here behaves as a pseudohalogen the compound reacts violently with water yielding caesium hydroxide metallic gold and hydrogen gas in liquid ammonia it can be reacted with a caesium specific ion exchange resin to produce tetramethylammonium auride the analogous platinum compound red caesium platinide cs pt contains the platinide ion that behaves as a pseudochalcogen complexes like all metal cations cs forms complexes with lewis bases in solution because of its large size cs usually adopts coordination numbers greater than the number typical for the smaller alkali metal cations this difference is apparent in the coordination of cscl this high coordination number and softness tendency to form covalent bonds are properties exploited in separating cs from other cations in the remediation of nuclear wastes where cs must be separated from large amounts of nonradioactive k halides caesium fluoride csf is a hygroscopic white solid that is widely used in organofluorine chemistry as a source of fluoride anions caesium fluoride has the halite structure which means that the cs and f pack in a cubic closest packed array as do na and cl in sodium chloride notably caesium and fluorine have the lowest and highest electronegativities respectively among all the known elements caesium chloride cscl crystallizes in the simple cubic crystal system also called the caesium chloride structure this structural motif is composed of a primitive cubic lattice with a two atom basis each with an eightfold coordination the chloride atoms lie upon the lattice points at the edges of the cube while the caesium atoms lie in the holes in the centre of the cubes this structure is shared with csbr and csi and many other compounds that do not contain cs in contrast most other alkaline halides have the sodium chloride nacl structure the cscl structure is preferred because cs has an ionic radius of pm and cl pm oxides more so than the other alkali metals caesium forms numerous binary compounds with oxygen when caesium burns in air the superoxide cso is the main product the normal caesium oxide cs o forms yellow orange hexagonal crystals and is the only oxide of the anti cdcl type it vaporizes at c f and decomposes to caesium metal and the peroxide cs o at temperatures above c f in addition to the superoxide and the ozonide cso several brightly coloured suboxides have also been studied these include cs o cs o cs o cs o dark green cso cs o as well as cs o the latter may be heated in a vacuum to generate cs o binary compounds with sulfur selenium and tellurium also exist isotopes caesium has known isotopes ranging in mass number i e number of nucleons in the nucleus from to several of these are synthesized from lighter elements by the slow neutron capture process s process inside old stars and by the r process in supernova explosions the only stable caesium isotope is cs with neutrons although it has a large nuclear spin nuclear magnetic resonance studies can use this isotope at a resonating frequency of mhz the radioactive cs has a very long half life of about million years the longest of all radioactive isotopes of caesium cs and cs have half lives of and two years respectively cs decomposes to a short lived mba by beta decay and then to nonradioactive barium while cs transforms into ba directly the isotopes with mass numbers of and have half lives between a day and two weeks while most of the other isotopes have half lives from a few seconds to fractions of a second at least metastable nuclear isomers exist other than mcs with a half life of just under hours all are very unstable and decay with half lives of a few minutes or less the isotope cs is one of the long lived fission products of uranium produced in nuclear reactors however this fission product yield is reduced in most reactors because the predecessor xe is a potent neutron poison and frequently transmutes to stable xe before it can decay to cs the beta decay from cs to mba is a strong emission of gamma radiation cs and sr are the principal medium lived products of nuclear fission and the prime sources of radioactivity from spent nuclear fuel after several years of cooling lasting several hundred years those two isotopes are the largest source of residual radioactivity in the area of the chernobyl disaster because of the low capture rate disposing of cs through neutron capture is not feasible and the only current solution is to allow it to decay over time almost all caesium produced from nuclear fission comes from the beta decay of originally more neutron rich fission products passing through various isotopes of iodine and xenon because iodine and xenon are volatile and can diffuse through nuclear fuel or air radioactive caesium is often created far from the original site of fission with nuclear weapons testing in the s through the s cs was released into the atmosphere and returned to the surface of the earth as a component of radioactive fallout it is a ready marker of the movement of soil and sediment from those times occurrence caesium is a relatively rare element estimated to average parts per million in the earth s crust it is the th most abundant element and the th among the metals nevertheless it is more abundant than such elements as antimony cadmium tin and tungsten and two orders of magnitude more abundant than mercury and silver it is as abundant as rubidium with which it is closely associated chemically due to its large ionic radius caesium is one of the incompatible elements during magma crystallization caesium is concentrated in the liquid phase and crystallizes last therefore the largest deposits of caesium are zone pegmatite ore bodies formed by this enrichment process because caesium does not substitute for potassium as readily as rubidium does the alkali evaporite minerals sylvite kcl and carnallite kmgcl h o may contain only caesium consequently caesium is found in few minerals percentage amounts of caesium may be found in beryl be al sio and avogadrite k cs bf up to wt cs o in the closely related mineral pezzottaite cs be li al si o up to wt cs o in the rare mineral londonite cs k al be b be o and less in the more widespread rhodizite the only economically important ore for caesium is pollucite cs alsi o which is found in a few places around the world in zoned pegmatites associated with the more commercially important lithium minerals lepidolite and petalite within the pegmatites the large grain size and the strong separation of the minerals results in high grade ore for mining the world s most significant and richest known source of caesium is the tanco mine at bernic lake in manitoba canada estimated to contain metric tons of pollucite ore representing more than two thirds of the world s reserve base although the stoichiometric content of caesium in pollucite is pure pollucite samples from this deposit contain only about caesium while the average content is wt commercial pollucite contains more than caesium the bikita pegmatite deposit in zimbabwe is mined for its petalite but it also contains a significant amount of pollucite another notable source of pollucite is in the karibib desert namibia at the present rate of world mine production of to metric tons per year reserves will last for thousands of years production mining and refining pollucite ore is a selective process and is conducted on a smaller scale than for most other metals the ore is crushed hand sorted but not usually concentrated and then ground caesium is then extracted from pollucite primarily by three methods acid digestion alkaline decomposition and direct reduction in the acid digestion the silicate pollucite rock is dissolved with strong acids such as hydrochloric hcl sulfuric h so hydrobromic hbr or hydrofluoric hf acids with hydrochloric acid a mixture of soluble chlorides is produced and the insoluble chloride double salts of caesium are precipitated as caesium antimony chloride cs sbcl caesium iodine chloride cs icl or caesium hexachlorocerate cs cecl after separation the pure precipitated double salt is decomposed and pure cscl is precipitated by evaporating the water the sulfuric acid method yields the insoluble double salt directly as caesium alum csal so h o the aluminium sulfate component is converted to insoluble aluminium oxide by roasting the alum with carbon and the resulting product is leached with water to yield a cs so solution roasting pollucite with calcium carbonate and calcium chloride yields insoluble calcium silicates and soluble caesium chloride leaching with water or dilute ammonia nh oh yields a dilute chloride cscl solution this solution can be evaporated to produce caesium chloride or transformed into caesium alum or caesium carbonate though not commercially feasible the ore can be directly reduced with potassium sodium or calcium in vacuum to produce caesium metal directly most of the mined caesium as salts is directly converted into caesium formate hcoo cs for applications such as oil drilling to supply the developing market cabot corporation built a production plant in at the tanco mine near bernic lake in manitoba with a capacity of barrels m per year of caesium formate solution the primary smaller scale commercial compounds of caesium are caesium chloride and nitrate alternatively caesium metal may be obtained from the purified compounds derived from the ore caesium chloride and the other caesium halides can be reduced at to c to f with calcium or barium and caesium metal distilled from the result in the same way the aluminate carbonate or hydroxide may be reduced by magnesium the metal can also be isolated by electrolysis of fused caesium cyanide cscn exceptionally pure and gas free caesium can be produced by c f thermal decomposition of caesium azide csn which can be produced from aqueous caesium sulfate and barium azide in vacuum applications caesium dichromate can be reacted with zirconium to produce pure caesium metal without other gaseous products cs cr o zr cs zro cr o the price of pure caesium metal basis in was about per gram oz but the compounds are significantly cheaper history in robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff discovered caesium in the mineral water from d rkheim germany because of the bright blue lines in the emission spectrum they derived the name from the latin word caesius meaning sky blue caesium was the first element to be discovered with a spectroscope which had been invented by bunsen and kirchhoff only a year previously to obtain a pure sample of caesium litres imp gal us gal of mineral water had to be evaporated to yield kilograms lb of concentrated salt solution the alkaline earth metals were precipitated either as sulfates or oxalates leaving the alkali metal in the solution after conversion to the nitrates and extraction with ethanol a sodium free mixture was obtained from this mixture the lithium was precipitated by ammonium carbonate potassium rubidium and caesium form insoluble salts with chloroplatinic acid but these salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water and the less soluble caesium and rubidium hexachloroplatinate cs rb ptcl were obtained by fractional crystallization after reduction of the hexachloroplatinate with hydrogen caesium and rubidium were separated by the difference in solubility of their carbonates in alcohol the process yielded grams oz of rubidium chloride and grams oz of caesium chloride from the initial litres of mineral water from the caesium chloride the two scientists estimated the atomic weight of the new element at compared to the currently accepted one of they tried to generate elemental caesium by electrolysis of molten caesium chloride but instead of a metal they obtained a blue homogeneous substance which neither under the naked eye nor under the microscope showed the slightest trace of metallic substance as a result they assigned it as a subchloride cs cl in reality the product was probably a colloidal mixture of the metal and caesium chloride the electrolysis of the aqueous solution of chloride with a mercury cathode produced a caesium amalgam which readily decomposed under the aqueous conditions the pure metal was eventually isolated by the german chemist carl setterberg while working on his doctorate with kekul and bunsen in he produced caesium metal by electrolysing caesium cyanide avoiding the problems with the chloride historically the most important use for caesium has been in research and development primarily in chemical and electrical fields very few applications existed for caesium until the s when it came into use in radio vacuum tubes where it had two functions as a getter it removed excess oxygen after manufacture and as a coating on the heated cathode it increased the electrical conductivity caesium was not recognized as a high performance industrial metal until the s applications for nonradioactive caesium included photoelectric cells photomultiplier tubes optical components of infrared spectrophotometers catalysts for several organic reactions crystals for scintillation counters and in magnetohydrodynamic power generators caesium is also used as a source of positive ions in secondary ion mass spectrometry sims since the international system of measurements has based the primary unit of time the second on the properties of caesium the international system of units si defines the second as the duration of cycles at the microwave frequency of the spectral line corresponding to the transition between two hyperfine energy levels of the ground state of caesium the th general conference on weights and measures of defined a second as the duration of cycles of microwave light absorbed or emitted by the hyperfine transition of caesium atoms in their ground state undisturbed by external fields applications petroleum exploration the largest present day use of nonradioactive caesium is in caesium formate drilling fluids for the extractive oil industry aqueous solutions of caesium formate hcoo cs made by reacting caesium hydroxide with formic acid were developed in the mid s for use as oil well drilling and completion fluids the function of a drilling fluid is to lubricate drill bits to bring rock cuttings to the surface and to maintain pressure on the formation during drilling of the well completion fluids assist the emplacement of control hardware after drilling but prior to production by maintaining the pressure the high density of the caesium formate brine up to g cm or pounds per gallon coupled with the relatively benign nature of most caesium compounds reduces the requirement for toxic high density suspended solids in the drilling fluid a significant technological engineering and environmental advantage unlike the components of many other heavy liquids caesium formate is relatively environment friendly caesium formate brine can be blended with potassium and sodium formates to decrease the density of the fluids to that of water g cm or pounds per gallon furthermore it is biodegradable and may be recycled which is important in view of its high cost about per barrel in alkali formates are safe to handle and do not damage the producing formation or downhole metals as corrosive alternative high density brines such as zinc bromide znbr solutions sometimes do they also require less cleanup and reduce disposal costs atomic clocks caesium based atomic clocks use the electromagnetic transitions in the hyperfine structure of caesium atoms as a reference point the first accurate caesium clock was built by louis essen in at the national physical laboratory in the uk caesium clocks have improved over the past half century and are regarded as the most accurate realization of a unit that mankind has yet achieved these clocks measure frequency with an error of to parts in which corresponds to an accuracy of nanoseconds per day or one second in million years the latest versions are more accurate than part in about second in million years the caesium standard is the primary standard for standards compliant time and frequency measurements caesium clocks regulate the timing of cell phone networks and the internet definition of the second the second symbol s is the si unit of time it is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency cs the unperturbed ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium atom to be when expressed in the unit hz which is equal to s electric power and electronics caesium vapour thermionic generators are low power devices that convert heat energy to electrical energy in the two electrode vacuum tube converter caesium neutralizes the space charge near the cathode and enhances the current flow caesium is also important for its photoemissive properties converting light to electron flow it is used in photoelectric cells because caesium based cathodes such as the intermetallic compound k cssb have a low threshold voltage for emission of electrons the range of photoemissive devices using caesium include optical character recognition devices photomultiplier tubes and video camera tubes nevertheless germanium rubidium selenium silicon tellurium and several other elements can be substituted for caesium in photosensitive materials caesium iodide csi bromide csbr and caesium fluoride csf crystals are employed for scintillators in scintillation counters widely used in mineral exploration and particle physics research to detect gamma and x ray radiation being a heavy element caesium provides good stopping power with better detection caesium compounds may provide a faster response csf and be less hygroscopic csi caesium vapour is used in many common magnetometers the element is used as an internal standard in spectrophotometry like other alkali metals caesium has a great affinity for oxygen and is used as a getter in vacuum tubes other uses of the metal include high energy lasers vapour glow lamps and vapour rectifiers centrifugation fluids the high density of the caesium ion makes solutions of caesium chloride caesium sulfate and caesium trifluoroacetate cs o ccf useful in molecular biology for density gradient ultracentrifugation this technology is used primarily in the isolation of viral particles subcellular organelles and fractions and nucleic acids from biological samples chemical and medical use relatively few chemical applications use caesium doping with caesium compounds enhances the effectiveness of several metal ion catalysts for chemical synthesis such as acrylic acid anthraquinone ethylene oxide methanol phthalic anhydride styrene methyl methacrylate monomers and various olefins it is also used in the catalytic conversion of sulfur dioxide into sulfur trioxide in the production of sulfuric acid caesium fluoride enjoys a niche use in organic chemistry as a base and as an anhydrous source of fluoride ion caesium salts sometimes replace potassium or sodium salts in organic synthesis such as cyclization esterification and polymerization caesium has also been used in thermoluminescent radiation dosimetry tld when exposed to radiation it acquires crystal defects that when heated revert with emission of light proportionate to the received dose thus measuring the light pulse with a photomultiplier tube can allow the accumulated radiation dose to be quantified nuclear and isotope applications caesium is a radioisotope commonly used as a gamma emitter in industrial applications its advantages include a half life of roughly years its availability from the nuclear fuel cycle and having ba as a stable end product the high water solubility is a disadvantage which makes it incompatible with large pool irradiators for food and medical supplies it has been used in agriculture cancer treatment and the sterilization of food sewage sludge and surgical equipment radioactive isotopes of caesium in radiation devices were used in the medical field to treat certain types of cancer but emergence of better alternatives and the use of water soluble caesium chloride in the sources which could create wide ranging contamination gradually put some of these caesium sources out of use caesium has been employed in a variety of industrial measurement gauges including moisture density levelling and thickness gauges it has also been used in well logging devices for measuring the electron density of the rock formations which is analogous to the bulk density of the formations caesium has been used in hydrologic studies analogous to those with tritium as a daughter product of fission bomb testing from the s through the mid s caesium was released into the atmosphere where it was absorbed readily into solution known year to year variation within that period allows correlation with soil and sediment layers caesium and to a lesser extent caesium have also been used in hydrology to measure the caesium output by the nuclear power industry while they are less prevalent than either caesium or caesium these bellwether isotopes are produced solely from anthropogenic sources other uses caesium and mercury were used as a propellant in early ion engines designed for spacecraft propulsion on very long interplanetary or extraplanetary missions the fuel was ionized by contact with a charged tungsten electrode but corrosion by caesium on spacecraft components has pushed development in the direction of inert gas propellants such as xenon which are easier to handle in ground based tests and do less potential damage to the spacecraft xenon was used in the experimental spacecraft deep space launched in nevertheless field emission electric propulsion thrusters that accelerate liquid metal ions such as caesium have been built caesium nitrate is used as an oxidizer and pyrotechnic colorant to burn silicon in infrared flares such as the luu flare because it emits much of its light in the near infrared spectrum caesium compounds may have been used as fuel additives to reduce the radar signature of exhaust plumes in the lockheed a cia reconnaissance aircraft caesium and rubidium have been added as a carbonate to glass because they reduce electrical conductivity and improve stability and durability of fibre optics and night vision devices caesium fluoride or caesium aluminium fluoride are used in fluxes formulated for brazing aluminium alloys that contain magnesium magnetohydrodynamic mhd power generating systems were researched but failed to gain widespread acceptance caesium metal has also been considered as the working fluid in high temperature rankine cycle turboelectric generators caesium salts have been evaluated as antishock reagents following the administration of arsenical drugs because of their effect on heart rhythms however they are less likely to be used than potassium or rubidium salts they have also been used to treat epilepsy caesium can be laser cooled and used to probe fundamental and technological problems in quantum physics it has a particularly convenient feshbach spectrum to enable studies of ultracold atoms requiring tunable interactions health and safety hazards nonradioactive caesium compounds are only mildly toxic and nonradioactive caesium is not a significant environmental hazard because biochemical processes can confuse and substitute caesium with potassium excess caesium can lead to hypokalemia arrhythmia and acute cardiac arrest but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources the median lethal dose ld for caesium chloride in mice is g per kilogram which is comparable to the ld values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride the principal use of nonradioactive caesium is as caesium formate in petroleum drilling fluids because it is much less toxic than alternatives though it is more costly caesium metal is one of the most reactive elements and is highly explosive in the presence of water the hydrogen gas produced by the reaction is heated by the thermal energy released at the same time causing ignition and a violent explosion this can occur with other alkali metals but caesium is so potent that this explosive reaction can be triggered even by cold water it is highly pyrophoric the autoignition temperature of caesium is c f and it ignites explosively in air to form caesium hydroxide and various oxides caesium hydroxide is a very strong base and will rapidly corrode glass the isotopes and are present in the biosphere in small amounts from human activities differing by location radiocaesium does not accumulate in the body as readily as other fission products such as radioiodine and radiostrontium about of absorbed radiocaesium washes out of the body relatively quickly in sweat and urine the remaining has a biological half life between and days radiocaesium follows potassium and tends to accumulate in plant tissues including fruits and vegetables plants vary widely in the absorption of caesium sometimes displaying great resistance to it it is also well documented that mushrooms from contaminated forests accumulate radiocaesium caesium in the fungal sporocarps accumulation of caesium in lakes has been a great concern after the chernobyl disaster experiments with dogs showed that a single dose of millicuries mbq g of caesium per kilogram is lethal within three weeks smaller amounts may cause infertility and cancer the international atomic energy agency and other sources have warned that radioactive materials such as caesium could be used in radiological dispersion devices or dirty bombs ,55
Barium,Ba,barium is a chemical element with the symbol ba and atomic number it is the fifth element in group and is a soft silvery alkaline earth metal because of its high chemical reactivity barium is never found in nature as a free element the most common minerals of barium are baryte barium sulfate baso and witherite barium carbonate baco the name barium originates from the alchemical derivative baryta from greek barys meaning heavy baric is the adjectival form of barium barium was identified as a new element in but not reduced to a metal until with the advent of electrolysis barium has few industrial applications historically it was used as a getter for vacuum tubes and in oxide form as the emissive coating on indirectly heated cathodes it is a component of ybco high temperature superconductors and electroceramics and is added to steel and cast iron to reduce the size of carbon grains within the microstructure barium compounds are added to fireworks to impart a green color barium sulfate is used as an insoluble additive to oil well drilling fluid in a purer form it is used as x ray radiocontrast agents for imaging the human gastrointestinal tract water soluble barium compounds are poisonous and have been used as rodenticides characteristics physical properties barium is a soft silvery white metal with a slight golden shade when ultrapure the silvery white color of barium metal rapidly vanishes upon oxidation in air yielding a dark gray layer containing the oxide barium has a medium specific weight and high electrical conductivity because barium is difficult to purify many of its properties have not been accurately determined at room temperature and pressure barium metal adopts a body centered cubic structure with a barium barium distance of picometers expanding with heating at a rate of approximately c it is a very soft metal with a mohs hardness of its melting temperature of k c f is intermediate between those of the lighter strontium k or c or f and heavier radium k or c or f however its boiling point of k c f exceeds that of strontium k or c or f the density g cm is again intermediate between those of strontium g cm and radium g cm chemical reactivity barium is chemically similar to magnesium calcium and strontium but even more reactive it is usually found in the oxidation state most exceptions are in a few rare and unstable molecular species that are only characterised in the gas phase such as baf but recently a barium i species has been reported in a graphite intercalation compound reactions with chalcogens are highly exothermic release energy the reaction with oxygen or air occurs at room temperature for this reason metallic barium is often stored under oil or in an inert atmosphere reactions with other nonmetals such as carbon nitrogen phosphorus silicon and hydrogen are generally exothermic and proceed upon heating reactions with water and alcohols are very exothermic and release hydrogen gas ba roh ba or h r is an alkyl group or a hydrogen atom barium reacts with ammonia to form complexes such as ba nh the metal is readily attacked by acids sulfuric acid is a notable exception because passivation stops the reaction by forming the insoluble barium sulfate on the surface barium combines with several other metals including aluminium zinc lead and tin forming intermetallic phases and alloys compounds barium salts are typically white when solid and colorless when dissolved they are denser than the strontium or calcium analogs except for the halides see table zinc is given for comparison barium hydroxide baryta was known to alchemists who produced it by heating barium carbonate unlike calcium hydroxide it absorbs very little co in aqueous solutions and is therefore insensitive to atmospheric fluctuations this property is used in calibrating ph equipment volatile barium compounds burn with a green to pale green flame which is an efficient test to detect a barium compound the color results from spectral lines at and nm organobarium compounds are a growing field of knowledge recently discovered are dialkylbariums and alkylhalobariums isotopes barium found in the earth s crust is a mixture of seven primordial nuclides barium and through barium undergoes very slow radioactive decay to xenon by double beta plus decay with a half life of years about times the age of the universe its abundance is that of natural barium theoretically barium can similarly undergo double beta decay to xenon this decay has not been detected the radioactivity of these isotopes are so weak that they pose no danger to life of the stable isotopes barium composes of all barium other isotopes have decreasing abundance with decreasing mass number in total barium has known isotopes ranging in mass between and the most stable artificial radioisotope is barium with a half life of approximately years five other isotopes have half lives longer than a day barium also has meta states of which barium m is the most stable with a half life of about hours history alchemists in the early middle ages knew about some barium minerals smooth pebble like stones of mineral baryte were found in volcanic rock near bologna italy and so were called bologna stones alchemists were attracted to them because after exposure to light they would glow for years the phosphorescent properties of baryte heated with organics were described by v casciorolus in carl scheele determined that baryte contained a new element in but could not isolate barium only barium oxide johan gottlieb gahn also isolated barium oxide two years later in similar studies oxidized barium was at first called barote by guyton de morveau a name that was changed by antoine lavoisier to baryta also in the th century english mineralogist william withering noted a heavy mineral in the lead mines of cumberland now known to be witherite barium was first isolated by electrolysis of molten barium salts in by sir humphry davy in england davy by analogy with calcium named barium after baryta with the ium ending signifying a metallic element robert bunsen and augustus matthiessen obtained pure barium by electrolysis of a molten mixture of barium chloride and ammonium chloride the production of pure oxygen in the brin process was a large scale application of barium peroxide in the s before it was replaced by electrolysis and fractional distillation of liquefied air in the early s in this process barium oxide reacts at c f with air to form barium peroxide which decomposes above c f by releasing oxygen bao o bao barium sulfate was first applied as a radiocontrast agent in x ray imaging of the digestive system in occurrence and production the abundance of barium is in the earth s crust and g l in sea water the primary commercial source of barium is baryte also called barytes or heavy spar a barium sulfate mineral with deposits in many parts of the world another commercial source far less important than baryte is witherite barium carbonate the main deposits are located in britain romania and the former ussr the baryte reserves are estimated between and billion tonnes the maximum production million tonnes was produced in but only was used for barium metal or compounds baryte production has risen since the second half of the s from million tonnes in to in and in china accounts for more than of this output followed by india in morocco us turkey iran and kazakhstan each the mined ore is washed crushed classified and separated from quartz if the quartz penetrates too deeply into the ore or the iron zinc or lead content is abnormally high then froth flotation is used the product is a pure baryte by mass the purity should be no less than with a minimal content of iron and silicon dioxide it is then reduced by carbon to barium sulfide baso c bas co the water soluble barium sulfide is the starting point for other compounds treating bas with oxygen produces the sulfate with nitric acid the nitrate with aqueous carbon dioxide the carbonate and so on the nitrate can be thermally decomposed to yield the oxide barium metal is produced by reduction with aluminium at c f the intermetallic compound baal is produced first bao al baal al o baal is an intermediate reacted with barium oxide to produce the metal note that not all barium is reduced bao baal ba baal o the remaining barium oxide reacts with the formed aluminium oxide bao al o baal o and the overall reaction is bao al ba baal o barium vapor is condensed and packed into molds in an atmosphere of argon this method is used commercially yielding ultrapure barium commonly sold barium is about pure with main impurities being strontium and calcium up to and and other contaminants contributing less than a similar reaction with silicon at c f yields barium and barium metasilicate electrolysis is not used because barium readily dissolves in molten halides and the product is rather impure gemstone the barium mineral benitoite barium titanium silicate occurs as a very rare blue fluorescent gemstone and is the official state gem of california barium in seawater barium exists in seawater as the ba ion with an average oceanic concentration of nmol kg barium also exists in the ocean as baso or barite barium has a nutrient like profile with a residence time of years barium shows a relatively consistent concentration in upper ocean seawater excepting regions of high river inputs and regions with strong upwelling there s little depletion of barium concentrations in the upper ocean for an ion with a nutrient like profile thus lateral mixing is important barium isotopic values show basin scale balances instead of local or short term processes applications metal and alloys barium as a metal or when alloyed with aluminium is used to remove unwanted gases gettering from vacuum tubes such as tv picture tubes barium is suitable for this purpose because of its low vapor pressure and reactivity towards oxygen nitrogen carbon dioxide and water it can even partly remove noble gases by dissolving them in the crystal lattice this application is gradually disappearing due to the rising popularity of the tubeless lcd and plasma sets other uses of elemental barium are minor and include an additive to silumin aluminium silicon alloys that refines their structure as well as bearing alloys lead tin soldering alloys to increase the creep resistance alloy with nickel for spark plugs additive to steel and cast iron as an inoculant alloys with calcium manganese silicon and aluminium as high grade steel deoxidizers barium sulfate and baryte barium sulfate the mineral baryte baso is important to the petroleum industry as a drilling fluid in oil and gas wells the precipitate of the compound called blanc fixe from the french for permanent white is used in paints and varnishes as a filler in ringing ink plastics and rubbers as a paper coating pigment and in nanoparticles to improve physical properties of some polymers such as epoxies barium sulfate has a low toxicity and relatively high density of ca g cm and thus opacity to x rays for this reason it is used as a radiocontrast agent in x ray imaging of the digestive system barium meals and barium enemas lithopone a pigment that contains barium sulfate and zinc sulfide is a permanent white with good covering power that does not darken when exposed to sulfides other barium compounds other compounds of barium find only niche applications limited by the toxicity of ba ions barium carbonate is a rat poison which is not a problem for the insoluble baso barium oxide coating on the electrodes of fluorescent lamps facilitates the release of electrons by its great atomic density barium carbonate increases the refractive index and luster of glass and reduces leaks of x rays from cathode ray tubes crt tv sets barium typically as barium nitrate imparts a yellow or apple green color to fireworks for brilliant green barium monochloride is used barium peroxide is a catalyst in the aluminothermic reaction thermite for welding rail tracks it is also a green flare in tracer ammunition and a bleaching agent barium titanate is a promising electroceramic barium fluoride is used for optics in infrared applications because of its wide transparency range of micrometers ybco was the first high temperature superconductor cooled by liquid nitrogen with a transition temperature of k c f that exceeded the boiling point of nitrogen k or c or f ferrite a type of sintered ceramic composed of iron oxide fe o and barium oxide bao is both electrically nonconductive and ferrimagnetic and can be temporarily or permanently magnetized palaeoceanography the lateral mixing of barium is caused by water mass mixing and ocean circulation global ocean circulation reveals a strong correlation between dissolved barium and silicic acid the large scale ocean circulation combined with remineralization of barium show a similar correlation between dissolved barium and ocean alkalinity dissolved barium s correlation with silicic acid can be seen both vertically and spatially particulate barium shows a strong correlation with particulate organic carbon or poc barium is becoming more popular to be used a base for palaeoceanographic proxies with both dissolved and particulate barium s links with silicic acid and poc it can be used to determine historical variations in the biological pump carbon cycle and global climate the barium particulate barite baso as one of many proxies can be used to provide a host of historical information on processes in different oceanic settings water column sediments and hydrothermal sites in each setting there are differences in isotopic and elemental composition of the barite particulate barite in the water column known as marine or pelagic barite reveals information on seawater chemistry variation over time barite in sediments known as diagenetic or cold seeps barite gives information about sedimentary redox processes barite formed via hydrothermal activity at hydrothermal vents known as hydrothermal barite reveals alterations in the condition of the earth s crust around those vents toxicity because of the high reactivity of the metal toxicological data are available only for compounds soluble barium compounds are poisonous in low doses barium ions act as a muscle stimulant and higher doses affect the nervous system causing cardiac irregularities tremors weakness anxiety shortness of breath and paralysis this toxicity may be caused by ba blocking potassium ion channels which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system other organs damaged by water soluble barium compounds i e barium ions are the eyes immune system heart respiratory system and skin causing for example blindness and sensitization barium is not carcinogenic and does not bioaccumulate inhaled dust containing insoluble barium compounds can accumulate in the lungs causing a benign condition called baritosis the insoluble sulfate is nontoxic and is not classified as a dangerous goods in transport regulations to avoid a potentially vigorous chemical reaction barium metal is kept in an argon atmosphere or under mineral oils contact with air is dangerous and may cause ignition moisture friction heat sparks flames shocks static electricity and exposure to oxidizers and acids should be avoided anything that may contact with barium should be electrically grounded anyone who works with the metal should wear pre cleaned non sparking shoes flame resistant rubber clothes rubber gloves apron goggles and a gas mask smoking in the working area is typically forbidden thorough washing is required after handling barium ,56
Lanthanum,La,lanthanum is a chemical element with the symbol la and atomic number it is a soft ductile silvery white metal that tarnishes slowly when exposed to air it is the eponym of the lanthanide series a group of similar elements between lanthanum and lutetium in the periodic table of which lanthanum is the first and the prototype lanthanum is traditionally counted among the rare earth elements like most other rare earth elements the usual oxidation state is lanthanum has no biological role in humans but is essential to some bacteria it is not particularly toxic to humans but does show some antimicrobial activity lanthanum usually occurs together with cerium and the other rare earth elements lanthanum was first found by the swedish chemist carl gustaf mosander in as an impurity in cerium nitrate hence the name lanthanum from the ancient greek lanthanein meaning to lie hidden although it is classified as a rare earth element lanthanum is the th most abundant element in the earth s crust almost three times as abundant as lead in minerals such as monazite and bastn site lanthanum composes about a quarter of the lanthanide content it is extracted from those minerals by a process of such complexity that pure lanthanum metal was not isolated until lanthanum compounds have numerous applications as catalysts additives in glass carbon arc lamps for studio lights and projectors ignition elements in lighters and torches electron cathodes scintillators gas tungsten arc welding electrodes and other things lanthanum carbonate is used as a phosphate binder in cases of high levels of phosphate in the blood seen with kidney failure characteristics physical lanthanum is the first element and prototype of the lanthanide series in the periodic table it appears to the right of the alkaline earth metal barium and to the left of the lanthanide cerium its placement has been disputed but most who study the matter along with a iupac provisional report consider lanthanum to be best placed as the first of the f block elements the electrons of a lanthanum atom are arranged in the configuration xe d s with three valence electrons outside the noble gas core in chemical reactions lanthanum almost always gives up these three valence electrons from the d and s subshells to form the oxidation state achieving the stable configuration of the preceding noble gas xenon some lanthanum ii compounds are also known but they are much less stable among the lanthanides lanthanum is exceptional as it has no f electrons as a single gas phase atom thus it is only very weakly paramagnetic unlike the strongly paramagnetic later lanthanides with the exceptions of the last two ytterbium and lutetium where the f shell is completely full however the f shell of lanthanum can become partially occupied in chemical environments and participate in chemical bonding for example the melting points of the trivalent lanthanides all but europium and ytterbium are related to the extent of hybridisation of the s d and f electrons lowering with increasing f involvement and lanthanum has the second lowest melting point among them c europium and ytterbium have lower melting points because they delocalise about two electrons per atom rather than three this chemical availability of f orbitals justifies lanthanum s placement in the f block despite its anomalous ground state configuration which is merely the result of strong interelectronic repulsion making it less profitable to occupy the f shell as it is small and close to the core electrons the lanthanides become harder as the series is traversed as expected lanthanum is a soft metal lanthanum has a relatively high resistivity of n m at room temperature in comparison the value for the good conductor aluminium is only n m lanthanum is the least volatile of the lanthanides like most of the lanthanides lanthanum has a hexagonal crystal structure at room temperature at c lanthanum changes to a face centered cubic structure and at c it changes to a body centered cubic structure chemical as expected from periodic trends lanthanum has the largest atomic radius of the lanthanides hence it is the most reactive among them tarnishing quite rapidly in air turning completely dark after several hours and can readily burn to form lanthanum iii oxide la o which is almost as basic as calcium oxide a centimeter sized sample of lanthanum will corrode completely in a year as its oxide spalls off like iron rust instead of forming a protective oxide coating like aluminium scandium yttrium and lutetium lanthanum reacts with the halogens at room temperature to form the trihalides and upon warming will form binary compounds with the nonmetals nitrogen carbon sulfur phosphorus boron selenium silicon and arsenic lanthanum reacts slowly with water to form lanthanum iii hydroxide la oh in dilute sulfuric acid lanthanum readily forms the aquated tripositive ion la h o this is colorless in aqueous solution since la has no d or f electrons lanthanum is the strongest and hardest base among the rare earth elements which is again expected from its being the largest of them some lanthanum ii compounds are also known but they are much less stable therefore in officially naming compounds of lanthanum its oxidation number always is to be mentioned isotopes naturally occurring lanthanum is made up of two isotopes the stable la and the primordial long lived radioisotope la la is by far the most abundant making up of natural lanthanum it is produced in the s process slow neutron capture which occurs in low to medium mass stars and the r process rapid neutron capture which occurs in core collapse supernovae it is the only stable isotope of lanthanum the very rare isotope la is one of the few primordial odd odd nuclei with a long half life of years it is one of the proton rich p nuclei which cannot be produced in the s or r processes la along with the even rarer mta is produced in the process where neutrinos interact with stable nuclei all other lanthanum isotopes are synthetic with the exception of la with a half life of about years all of them have half lives less than a day and most have half lives less than a minute the isotopes la and la occur as fission products of uranium compounds lanthanum oxide is a white solid that can be prepared by direct reaction of its constituent elements due to the large size of the la ion la o adopts a hexagonal coordinate structure that changes to the coordinate structure of scandium oxide sc o and yttrium oxide y o at high temperature when it reacts with water lanthanum hydroxide is formed a lot of heat is evolved in the reaction and a hissing sound is heard lanthanum hydroxide will react with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form the basic carbonate lanthanum fluoride is insoluble in water and can be used as a qualitative test for the presence of la the heavier halides are all very soluble deliquescent compounds the anhydrous halides are produced by direct reaction of their elements as heating the hydrates causes hydrolysis for example heating hydrated lacl produces laocl lanthanum reacts exothermically with hydrogen to produce the dihydride lah a black pyrophoric brittle conducting compound with the calcium fluoride structure this is a non stoichiometric compound and further absorption of hydrogen is possible with a concomitant loss of electrical conductivity until the more salt like lah is reached like lai and lai lah is probably an electride compound due to the large ionic radius and great electropositivity of la there is not much covalent contribution to its bonding and hence it has a limited coordination chemistry like yttrium and the other lanthanides lanthanum oxalate does not dissolve very much in alkali metal oxalate solutions and la acac h o decomposes around c oxygen is the most common donor atom in lanthanum complexes which are mostly ionic and often have high coordination numbers over is the most characteristic forming square antiprismatic and dodecadeltahedral structures these high coordinate species reaching up to coordination number with the use of chelating ligands such as in la so h o often have a low degree of symmetry because of stereo chemical factors lanthanum chemistry tends not to involve bonding due to the electron configuration of the element thus its organometallic chemistry is quite limited the best characterized organolanthanum compounds are the cyclopentadienyl complex la c h which is produced by reacting anhydrous lacl with nac h in tetrahydrofuran and its methyl substituted derivatives history in the swedish mineralogist axel fredrik cronstedt discovered a heavy mineral from the mine at bastn s later named cerite thirty years later the fifteen year old wilhelm hisinger from the family owning the mine sent a sample of it to carl scheele who did not find any new elements within in after hisinger had become an ironmaster he returned to the mineral with j ns jacob berzelius and isolated a new oxide which they named ceria after the dwarf planet ceres which had been discovered two years earlier ceria was simultaneously independently isolated in germany by martin heinrich klaproth between and ceria was shown to be a mixture of oxides by the swedish surgeon and chemist carl gustaf mosander who lived in the same house as berzelius he separated out two other oxides which he named lanthana and didymia he partially decomposed a sample of cerium nitrate by roasting it in air and then treating the resulting oxide with dilute nitric acid that same year axel erdmann a student also at the karolinska institute discovered lanthanum in a new mineral from l ven island located in a norwegian fjord finally mosander explained his delay saying that he had extracted a second element from cerium and this he called didymium although he didn t realise it didymium too was a mixture and in it was separated into praseodymium and neodymium since lanthanum s properties differed only slightly from those of cerium and occurred along with it in its salts he named it from the ancient greek lanthanein lit to lie hidden relatively pure lanthanum metal was first isolated in occurrence and production lanthanum is the third most abundant of all the lanthanides making up mg kg of the earth s crust behind neodymium at mg kg and cerium at mg kg it is almost three times as abundant as lead in the earth s crust despite being among the so called rare earth metals lanthanum is thus not rare at all but it is historically so named because it is rarer than common earths such as lime and magnesia and historically only a few deposits were known lanthanum is considered a rare earth metal because the process to mine it is difficult time consuming and expensive lanthanum is rarely the dominant lanthanide found in the rare earth minerals and in their chemical formulae it is usually preceded by cerium rare examples of la dominant minerals are monazite la and lanthanite la the la ion is similarly sized to the early lanthanides of the cerium group those up to samarium and europium that immediately follow in the periodic table and hence it tends to occur along with them in phosphate silicate and carbonate minerals such as monazite miiipo and bastn site miiico f where m refers to all the rare earth metals except scandium and the radioactive promethium mostly ce la and y bastn site is usually lacking in thorium and the heavy lanthanides and the purification of the light lanthanides from it is less involved the ore after being crushed and ground is first treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid evolving carbon dioxide hydrogen fluoride and silicon tetrafluoride the product is then dried and leached with water leaving the early lanthanide ions including lanthanum in solution the procedure for monazite which usually contains all the rare earths as well as thorium is more involved monazite because of its magnetic properties can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation after separation it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water soluble sulfates of rare earths the acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to ph thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed after that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths to their insoluble oxalates the oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing the oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of the main components cerium whose oxide is insoluble in hno lanthanum is separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization this salt is relatively less soluble than other rare earth double salts and therefore stays in the residue care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain ra the daughter of th which is a strong gamma emitter lanthanum is relatively easy to extract as it has only one neighbouring lanthanide cerium which can be removed by making use of its ability to be oxidised to the state thereafter lanthanum may be separated out by the historical method of fractional crystallization of la no nh no h o or by ion exchange techniques when higher purity is desired lanthanum metal is obtained from its oxide by heating it with ammonium chloride or fluoride and hydrofluoric acid at c to produce the chloride or fluoride la o nh cl lacl nh h othis is followed by reduction with alkali or alkaline earth metals in vacuum or argon atmosphere lacl li la liclalso pure lanthanum can be produced by electrolysis of molten mixture of anhydrous lacl and nacl or kcl at elevated temperatures applications the first historical application of lanthanum was in gas lantern mantles carl auer von welsbach used a mixture of lanthanum oxide and zirconium oxide which he called actinophor and patented in the original mantles gave a green tinted light and were not very successful and his first company which established a factory in atzgersdorf in failed in modern uses of lanthanum include one material used for anodic material of nickel metal hydride batteries is la ni mn al co due to high cost to extract the other lanthanides a mischmetal with more than of lanthanum is used instead of pure lanthanum the compound is an intermetallic component of the ab type nimh batteries can be found in many models of the toyota prius sold in the us these larger nickel metal hydride batteries require massive quantities of lanthanum for the production the toyota prius nimh battery requires to kilograms to lb of lanthanum as engineers push the technology to increase fuel efficiency twice that amount of lanthanum could be required per vehicle hydrogen sponge alloys can contain lanthanum these alloys are capable of storing up to times their own volume of hydrogen gas in a reversible adsorption process heat energy is released every time they do so therefore these alloys have possibilities in energy conservation systems mischmetal a pyrophoric alloy used in lighter flints contains to lanthanum lanthanum oxide and the boride are used in electronic vacuum tubes as hot cathode materials with strong emissivity of electrons crystals of lab are used in high brightness extended life thermionic electron emission sources for electron microscopes and hall effect thrusters lanthanum trifluoride laf is an essential component of a heavy fluoride glass named zblan this glass has superior transmittance in the infrared range and is therefore used for fiber optical communication systems cerium doped lanthanum bromide and lanthanum chloride are the recent inorganic scintillators which have a combination of high light yield best energy resolution and fast response their high yield converts into superior energy resolution moreover the light output is very stable and quite high over a very wide range of temperatures making it particularly attractive for high temperature applications these scintillators are already widely used commercially in detectors of neutrons or gamma rays carbon arc lamps use a mixture of rare earth elements to improve the light quality this application especially by the motion picture industry for studio lighting and projection consumed about of the rare earth compounds produced until the phase out of carbon arc lamps lanthanum iii oxide la o improves the alkali resistance of glass and is used in making special optical glasses such as infrared absorbing glass as well as camera and telescope lenses because of the high refractive index and low dispersion of rare earth glasses lanthanum oxide is also used as a grain growth additive during the liquid phase sintering of silicon nitride and zirconium diboride small amounts of lanthanum added to steel improves its malleability resistance to impact and ductility whereas addition of lanthanum to molybdenum decreases its hardness and sensitivity to temperature variations small amounts of lanthanum are present in many pool products to remove the phosphates that feed algae lanthanum oxide additive to tungsten is used in gas tungsten arc welding electrodes as a substitute for radioactive thorium various compounds of lanthanum and other rare earth elements oxides chlorides etc are components of various catalysis such as petroleum cracking catalysts lanthanum barium radiometric dating is used to estimate age of rocks and ores though the technique has limited popularity lanthanum carbonate was approved as a medication fosrenol shire pharmaceuticals to absorb excess phosphate in cases of hyperphosphatemia seen in end stage kidney disease lanthanum fluoride is used in phosphor lamp coatings mixed with europium fluoride it is also applied in the crystal membrane of fluoride ion selective electrodes like horseradish peroxidase lanthanum is used as an electron dense tracer in molecular biology lanthanum modified bentonite or phoslock is used to remove phosphates from water in lake treatments lanthanum telluride la te is considered to be applied in the field of radioisotope power system nuclear power plant due to its significant conversion capabilities the transmuted elements and isotopes in the segment will not react with the material itself thus presenting no harm to the safety of the power plant though iodine which can be generated during transmutation is suspected to react with la te segment the quantity of iodine is small enough to possess threat to the power system biological role lanthanum has no known biological role in humans the element is very poorly absorbed after oral administration and when injected its elimination is very slow lanthanum carbonate fosrenol was approved as a phosphate binder to absorb excess phosphate in cases of end stage renal disease while lanthanum has pharmacological effects on several receptors and ion channels its specificity for the gaba receptor is unique among trivalent cations lanthanum acts at the same modulatory site on the gaba receptor as zinc a known negative allosteric modulator the lanthanum cation la is a positive allosteric modulator at native and recombinant gaba receptors increasing open channel time and decreasing desensitization in a subunit configuration dependent manner lanthanum is an essential cofactor for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium methylacidiphilum fumariolicum solv although the great chemical similarity of the lanthanides means that it may be substituted with cerium praseodymium or neodymium without ill effects and with the smaller samarium europium or gadolinium giving no side effects other than slower growth precautions lanthanum has a low to moderate level of toxicity and should be handled with care the injection of lanthanum solutions produces hyperglycemia low blood pressure degeneration of the spleen and hepatic alterations the application in carbon arc light led to the exposure of people to rare earth element oxides and fluorides which sometimes led to pneumoconiosis as the la ion is similar in size to the ca ion it is sometimes used as an easily traced substitute for the latter in medical studies lanthanum like the other lanthanides is known to affect human metabolism lowering cholesterol levels blood pressure appetite and risk of blood coagulation when injected into the brain it acts as a painkiller similarly to morphine and other opiates though the mechanism behind this is still unknown prices the price for a metric ton kg of lanthanum oxide fob china in usd mt is given by the institute of rare earths elements and strategic metals as below for most of the period from early to september at in the short term in it rose steeply to in mid and fell back just as rapidly to by early the average price for the last six months april to september is given by the institute as follows lanthanum oxide min fob china eur mt and for lanthanum metal min

Cerium,Ce,cerium is a chemical element with the symbol ce and atomic number cerium is a soft ductile and silvery white metal that tarnishes when exposed to air cerium is the second element in the lanthanide series and while it often shows the oxidation state characteristic of the series it also has a stable state that does not oxidize water it is also considered one of the rare earth elements cerium has no known biological role in humans but is not particularly toxic except with intense or continued exposure despite always occurring in combination with the other rare earth elements in minerals such as those of the monazite and bastn site groups cerium is easy to extract from its ores as it can be distinguished among the lanthanides by its unique ability to be oxidized to the state in aqueous solution it is the most common of the lanthanides followed by neodymium lanthanum and praseodymium it is the th most abundant element making up ppm of the earth s crust half as much as chlorine and five times as much as lead cerium was the first of the lanthanides to be discovered in bastn s sweden by j ns jakob berzelius and wilhelm hisinger in and independently by martin heinrich klaproth in germany in the same year in carl gustaf mosander became the first to isolate the metal today cerium and its compounds have a variety of uses for example cerium iv oxide is used to polish glass and is an important part of catalytic converters cerium metal is used in ferrocerium lighters for its pyrophoric properties cerium doped yag phosphor is used in conjunction with blue light emitting diodes to produce white light in most commercial white led light sources characteristics physical cerium is the second element of the lanthanide series in the periodic table it appears between the lanthanides lanthanum to its left and praseodymium to its right and above the actinide thorium it is a ductile metal with a hardness similar to that of silver its electrons are arranged in the configuration xe f d s of which the four outer electrons are valence electrons the f d and s energy levels are very close to each other and the transfer of one electron to the d shell is due to strong interelectronic repulsion in the compact f shell this effect is overwhelmed when the atom is positively ionised thus ce on its own has instead the regular configuration xe f although in some solid solutions it may be xe f d most lanthanides can use only three electrons as valence electrons as afterwards the remaining f electrons are too strongly bound cerium is an exception because of the stability of the empty f shell in ce and the fact that it comes very early in the lanthanide series where the nuclear charge is still low enough until neodymium to allow the removal of the fourth valence electron by chemical means cerium has a variable electronic structure the energy of the f electron is nearly the same as that of the outer d and s electrons that are delocalized in the metallic state and only a small amount of energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels this gives rise to dual valence states for example a volume change of about occurs when cerium is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures it appears that the valence changes from about to when it is cooled or compressed chemical properties of the element with e of v for the ce ce couple cerium metal is a good reductant logically it tarnishes in air forming a passivating oxide layer like iron rust a centimeter sized sample of cerium metal corrodes completely in about a year more dramatically metallic cerium can be highly pyrophoric ce o ceo being highly electropositive cerium reacts with water the reaction is slow with cold water but speeds up with increasing temperature producing cerium iii hydroxide and hydrogen gas ce h o ce oh h allotropes four allotropic forms of cerium are known to exist at standard pressure and are given the common labels of to the high temperature form cerium has a bcc body centered cubic crystal structure and exists above c the stable form below c to approximately room temperature is cerium with an fcc face centered cubic crystal structure the dhcp double hexagonal close packed form cerium is the equilibrium structure approximately from room temperature to c the fcc form cerium is stable below about c it has a density of g cm other solid phases occurring only at high pressures are shown on the phase diagram both and forms are quite stable at room temperature although the equilibrium transformation temperature is estimated at c at lower temperatures the behavior of cerium is complicated by the slow rates of transformation transformation temperatures are subject to substantial hysteresis and values quoted here are approximate upon cooling below c cerium starts to change to cerium but the transformation involves a volume increase and as more forms the internal stresses build up and suppress further transformation cooling below approximately c will start formation of cerium but this is only from remaining cerium cerium does not significantly transform to cerium except in the presence of stress or deformation at atmospheric pressure liquid cerium is more dense than its solid form at the melting point isotopes naturally occurring cerium is made up of four isotopes ce ce ce and ce all four are observationally stable though the light isotopes ce and ce are theoretically expected to undergo inverse double beta decay to isotopes of barium and the heaviest isotope ce is expected to undergo double beta decay to nd or alpha decay to ba additionally ce would release energy upon spontaneous fission none of these decay modes have yet been observed though the double beta decay of ce ce and ce have been experimentally searched for the current experimental limits for their half lives are ce y ce y ce yall other cerium isotopes are synthetic and radioactive the most stable of them are ce with a half life of days ce with a half life of days and ce with a half life of days all other radioactive cerium isotopes have half lives under four days and most of them have half lives under ten minutes the isotopes between ce and ce inclusive occur as fission products of uranium the primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than ce is inverse beta decay or electron capture to isotopes of lanthanum while that of the heavier isotopes is beta decay to isotopes of praseodymium some isotopes of neodymium can alpha decay or are predicted to decay to isotopes of cerium the rarity of the proton rich ce and ce is explained by the fact that they cannot be made in the most common processes of stellar nucleosynthesis for elements beyond iron the s process slow neutron capture and the r process rapid neutron capture this is so because they are bypassed by the reaction flow of the s process and the r process nuclides are blocked from decaying to them by more neutron rich stable nuclides such nuclei are called p nuclei and their origin is not yet well understood some speculated mechanisms for their formation include proton capture as well as photodisintegration ce is the most common isotope of cerium as it can be produced in both the s and r processes while ce can only be produced in the r process another reason for the abundance of ce is that it is a magic nucleus having a closed neutron shell it has neutrons and hence it has a very low cross section towards further neutron capture although its proton number of is not magic it is granted additional stability as its eight additional protons past the magic number enter and complete the g proton orbital the abundances of the cerium isotopes may differ very slightly in natural sources because ce and ce are the daughters of the long lived primordial radionuclides la and nd respectively compounds cerium exists in two main oxidation states ce iii and ce iv this pair of adjacent oxidation states dominates several aspects of the chemistry of this element cerium iv aqueous solutions may be prepared by reacting cerium iii solutions with the strong oxidizing agents peroxodisulfate or bismuthate the value of e ce ce varies widely depending on conditions due to the relative ease of complexation and hydrolysis with various anions although v is representative cerium is the only lanthanide which has important aqueous and coordination chemistry in the oxidation state halides cerium forms all four trihaldies cex x f cl br i usually by reaction of the oxides with the hydrogen halides the anhydrous halides are pale colored paramagnetic hygroscopic solids upon hydration the trihalides convert to complexes containing aquo complexes ce h o unlike most lanthanides ce forms a tetrafluoride a white solid it also forms a bronze colored diiodide which has metallic properties aside from the binary halide phases a number of anionic halide complexes are known fluoride gives the ce iv derivatives cef and cef chloride gives the orange cecl oxides and chalcogenides cerium iv oxide ceria has the fluorite structure similarly to the dioxides of praseodymium and terbium ceria is a nonstoichiometric compound meaning that the real formula is ceo x where x is about thus the material is not perfectly described as ce iv ceria reduces to cerium iii oxide with hydrogen gas many nonstoichiometric chalcogenides are also known along with the trivalent ce z z s se te the monochalcogenides cez conduct electricity and would better be formulated as ce z e while cez are known they are polychalcogenides with cerium iii cerium iv derivatives of s se and te are unknown cerium iv complexes the compound ceric ammonium nitrate can nh ce no is the most common cerium compound encountered in the laboratory the six nitrate ligands bind as bidentate ligands the complex ce no is coordinate a high coordination number which emphasizes the large size of the ce ion can is popular oxidant in organic synthesis both as a stoichiometric reagent and as a catalyst it is inexpensive easily handled it operates by one electron redox cerium nitrates also form and complexes with crown the ratio referring to that between cerium and the crown ether classically can is a primary standard for quantitative analysis cerium iv salts especially cerium iv sulfate are often used as standard reagents for volumetric analysis in cerimetric titrations due to ligand to metal charge transfer aqueous cerium iv ions are orange yellow aqueous cerium iv is metastable in water and is a strong oxidizing agent that oxidizes hydrochloric acid to give chlorine gas in the belousov zhabotinsky reaction cerium oscillates between the and oxidation states to catalyze the reaction organocerium compounds organocerium chemistry is similar to that of the other lanthanides often involving complexes of cyclopentadienyl and cyclooctatetraenyl ligands cerocene ce c h adopts the uranocene molecular structure the f electron in cerocene ce c h is poised ambiguously between being localized and delocalized and this compound is considered intermediate valent alkyl alkynyl and alkenyl organocerium derivatives are prepared from the transmetallation of the respective organolithium or grignard reagents and are more nucleophilic but less basic than their precursors history cerium was discovered in bastn s in sweden by j ns jakob berzelius and wilhelm hisinger and independently in germany by martin heinrich klaproth both in cerium was named by berzelius after the asteroid ceres discovered two years earlier the asteroid is itself named after the roman goddess ceres goddess of agriculture grain crops fertility and motherly relationships cerium was originally isolated in the form of its oxide which was named ceria a term that is still used the metal itself was too electropositive to be isolated by then current smelting technology a characteristic of rare earth metals in general after the development of electrochemistry by humphry davy five years later the earths soon yielded the metals they contained ceria as isolated in contained all of the lanthanides present in the cerite ore from bastn s sweden and thus only contained about of what is now known to be pure ceria it was not until carl gustaf mosander succeeded in removing lanthana and didymia in the late s that ceria was obtained pure wilhelm hisinger was a wealthy mine owner and amateur scientist and sponsor of berzelius he owned and controlled the mine at bastn s and had been trying for years to find out the composition of the abundant heavy gangue rock the tungsten of bastn s which despite its name contained no tungsten now known as cerite that he had in his mine mosander and his family lived for many years in the same house as berzelius and mosander was undoubtedly persuaded by berzelius to investigate ceria further the element played a role in the manhattan project where cerium compounds were investigated in the berkeley site as materials for crucibles for uranium and plutonium casting for this reason new methods for the preparation and casting of cerium were developed within the scope of the ames daughter project now the ames laboratory production of extremely pure cerium in ames commenced in mid and continued until august occurrence and production cerium is the most abundant of all the lanthanides making up ppm of the earth s crust this value is just behind that of copper ppm and cerium is even more abundant than common metals such as lead ppm and tin ppm thus despite its position as one of the so called rare earth metals cerium is actually not rare at all cerium content in the soil varies between and ppm with an average of ppm seawater contains parts per trillion of cerium cerium occurs in various minerals but the most important commercial sources are the minerals of the monazite and bastn site groups where it makes up about half of the lanthanide content monazite ce is the most common representative of the monazites with ce being the levinson suffix informing on the dominance of the particular ree element representative also the cerium dominant bastn site ce is the most important of the bastn sites cerium is the easiest lanthanide to extract from its minerals because it is the only one that can reach a stable oxidation state in aqueous solution because of the decreased solubility of cerium in the oxidation state cerium is sometimes depleted from rocks relative to the other rare earth elements and is incorporated into zircon since ce and zr have the same charge and similar ionic radii in extreme cases cerium iv can form its own minerals separated from the other rare earth elements such as cerianite ce th o correctly named cerianite ce bastn site lniiico f is usually lacking in thorium and the heavy lanthanides beyond samarium and europium and hence the extraction of cerium from it is quite direct first the bastn site is purified using dilute hydrochloric acid to remove calcium carbonate impurities the ore is then roasted in the air to oxidize it to the lanthanide oxides while most of the lanthanides will be oxidized to the sesquioxides ln o cerium will be oxidized to the dioxide ceo this is insoluble in water and can be leached out with m hydrochloric acid leaving the other lanthanides behind the procedure for monazite ln th po which usually contains all the rare earths as well as thorium is more involved monazite because of its magnetic properties can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation after separation it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water soluble sulfates of rare earths the acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to ph thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed after that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths to their insoluble oxalates the oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing the oxides are dissolved in nitric acid but cerium oxide is insoluble in hno and hence precipitates out care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain ra the daughter of th which is a strong gamma emitter applications cerium has two main applications both of which use ceo the industrial application of ceria is for polishing especially chemical mechanical planarization cmp in its other main application ceo is used to decolorize glass it functions by converting green tinted ferrous impurities to nearly colorless ferric oxides sensors other automotive applications for the lower sesquioxide are as a catalytic converter for the oxidation of co and nox emissions in the exhaust gases from motor vehicles ceria has also been used as a substitute for its radioactive congener thoria for example in the manufacture of electrodes used in gas tungsten arc welding where ceria as an alloying element improves arc stability and ease of starting while decreasing burn off gas mantles and pyrophoric alloys the first use of cerium was in gas mantles invented by austrian chemist carl auer von welsbach in he had previously experimented with mixtures of magnesium lanthanum and yttrium oxides but these gave green tinted light and were unsuccessful six years later he discovered that pure thorium oxide produced a much better though blue light and that mixing it with cerium dioxide resulted in a bright white light cerium dioxide also acts as a catalyst for the combustion of thorium oxide this resulted in commercial success for von welsbach and his invention and created great demand for thorium its production resulted in a large amount of lanthanides being simultaneously extracted as by products applications were soon found for them especially in the pyrophoric alloy known as mischmetal composed of cerium lanthanum and the remainder being the other lanthanides that is used widely for lighter flints usually iron is added to form the alloy ferrocerium also invented by von welsbach due to the chemical similarities of the lanthanides chemical separation is not usually required for their applications such as the addition of mischmetal to steel as an inclusion modifier to improve mechanical properties or as catalysts for the cracking of petroleum this property of cerium saved the life of writer primo levi at the auschwitz concentration camp when he found a supply of ferrocerium alloy and bartered it for food pigments and phosphors the photostability of pigments can be enhanced by the addition of cerium as it provides pigments with lightfastness and prevents clear polymers from darkening in sunlight an example of a cerium compound used on its own as an inorganic pigment is the vivid red cerium iii sulfide cerium sulfide red which stays chemically inert up to very high temperatures the pigment is a safer alternative to lightfast but toxic cadmium selenide based pigments the addition of cerium oxide to older cathode ray tube television glass plates was beneficial as it suppresses the darkening effect from the creation of f center defects due to the continuous electron bombardment during operation cerium is also an essential component as a dopant for phosphors used in crt tv screens fluorescent lamps and later white light emitting diodes the most commonly used example is cerium iii doped yttrium aluminium garnet ce yag which emits green to yellow green light nm and also behaves as a scintillator other alloys and refractories cerium salts such as the sulfides ce s and ce s were considered during the manhattan project as advanced refractory materials for the construction of crucibles which could withstand the high temperatures and strongly reducing conditions when casting plutonium metal despite desirable properties these sulfides were never widely adopted due to practical issues with their synthesis cerium is used as alloying element in aluminum to create castable eutectic aluminum alloys with wt ce to which mg and or si can be further added these al ce alloys have excellent high temperature strength and are suitable for automotive applications e g in cylinder heads other alloys of cerium include pu ce and pu ce co plutonium alloys which have been used as nuclear fuel biological role and precautions the early lanthanides have been found to be essential to some methanotrophic bacteria living in volcanic mudpots such as methylacidiphilum fumariolicum lanthanum cerium praseodymium and neodymium are about equally effective cerium is otherwise not known to have biological role in any other organisms but is not very toxic either it does not accumulate in the food chain to any appreciable extent because it often occurs together with calcium in phosphate minerals and bones are primarily calcium phosphate cerium can accumulate in bones in small amounts that are not considered dangerous cerium like the other lanthanides is known to affect human metabolism lowering cholesterol levels blood pressure appetite and risk of blood coagulation cerium nitrate is an effective topical antimicrobial treatment for third degree burns although large doses can lead to cerium poisoning and methemoglobinemia the early lanthanides act as essential cofactors for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium methylacidiphilum fumariolicum solv for which lanthanum cerium praseodymium and neodymium alone are about equally effective like all rare earth metals cerium is of low to moderate toxicity a strong reducing agent it ignites spontaneously in air at to c fumes from cerium fires are toxic water should not be used to stop cerium fires as cerium reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas workers exposed to cerium have experienced itching sensitivity to heat and skin lesions cerium is not toxic when eaten but animals injected with large doses of cerium have died due to cardiovascular collapse cerium is more dangerous to aquatic organisms on account of being damaging to cell membranes this is an important risk because it is not very soluble in water thus causing contamination of the environment ,58
Praseodymium,Pr,praseodymium is a chemical element with the symbol pr and the atomic number it is the third member of the lanthanide series and is considered to be one of the rare earth metals it is a soft silvery malleable and ductile metal valued for its magnetic electrical chemical and optical properties it is too reactive to be found in native form and pure praseodymium metal slowly develops a green oxide coating when exposed to air praseodymium always occurs naturally together with the other rare earth metals it is the sixth most abundant rare earth element and fourth most abundant lanthanide making up parts per million of the earth s crust an abundance similar to that of boron in swedish chemist carl gustav mosander extracted a rare earth oxide residue he called didymium from a residue he called lanthana in turn separated from cerium salts in the austrian chemist baron carl auer von welsbach separated didymium into two elements that gave salts of different colours which he named praseodymium and neodymium the name praseodymium comes from the ancient greek prasinos meaning leek green and didymos twin like most rare earth elements praseodymium most readily forms the oxidation state which is the only stable state in aqueous solution although the oxidation state is known in some solid compounds and uniquely among the lanthanides the oxidation state is attainable in matrix isolation conditions the and oxidation states are rarely found aqueous praseodymium ions are yellowish green and similarly praseodymium results in various shades of yellow green when incorporated into glasses many of praseodymium s industrial uses involve its ability to filter yellow light from light sources properties physical properties praseodymium is the third member of the lanthanide series and a member of the rare earth metals in the periodic table it appears between the lanthanides cerium to its left and neodymium to its right and above the actinide protactinium it is a ductile metal with a hardness comparable to that of silver its electrons are arranged in the configuration xe f s theoretically all five outer electrons can act as valence electrons but the use of all five requires extreme conditions and normally praseodymium only gives up three or sometimes four electrons in its compounds like most other metals in the lanthanide series praseodymium usually only uses three electrons as valence electrons as afterward the remaining f electrons are too strongly bound this is because the f orbitals penetrate the most through the inert xenon core of electrons to the nucleus followed by d and s and this increases with higher ionic charge praseodymium nevertheless can continue losing a fourth and even occasionally a fifth valence electron because it comes very early in the lanthanide series where the nuclear charge is still low enough and the f subshell energy high enough to allow the removal of further valence electrons thus similarly to the other early trivalent lanthanides praseodymium has a double hexagonal close packed crystal structure at room temperature at about c it transitions to a face centered cubic structure and a body centered cubic structure appears shortly before the melting point of c praseodymium like all of the lanthanides except lanthanum ytterbium and lutetium which have no unpaired f electrons is paramagnetic at room temperature unlike some other rare earth metals which show antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures praseodymium is paramagnetic at all temperatures above k isotopes praseodymium has only one stable and naturally occurring isotope pr it is thus a mononuclidic and monoisotopic element and its standard atomic weight can be determined with high precision as it is a constant of nature this isotope has neutrons which is a magic number that confers additional stability this isotope is produced in stars through the s and r processes slow and rapid neutron capture respectively other radioisotopes have been synthesized all of these isotopes have half lives under a day and most under a minute with the single exception of pr with a half life of days both pr and pr occur as fission products of uranium the primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than pr is positron emission or electron capture to isotopes of cerium while that of heavier isotopes is beta decay to isotopes of neodymium chemical properties praseodymium metal tarnishes slowly in air forming a spalling green oxide layer like iron rust a centimetre sized sample of praseodymium metal corrodes completely in about a year it burns readily at c to form praseodymium iii iv oxide a nonstoichiometric compound approximating to pr o pr o pr o this may be reduced to praseodymium iii oxide pr o with hydrogen gas praseodymium iv oxide pro is the most oxidised product of the combustion of praseodymium and can be obtained by either reaction of praseodymium metal with pure oxygen at c and bar or by disproportionation of pr o in boiling acetic acid the reactivity of praseodymium conforms to periodic trends as it is one of the first and thus one of the largest lanthanides at c many praseodymium oxides with composition pro x exist as disordered nonstoichiometric phases with x but at c the oxide defects are instead ordered creating phases of the general formula prno n with n and these phases proy are sometimes labelled and nonstoichiometric y and praseodymium is an electropositive element and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form praseodymium iii hydroxide pr s h o l pr oh aq h g praseodymium metal reacts with all the stable halogens to form trihalides pr s f g prf s green pr s cl g prcl s green pr s br g prbr s green pr s i g pri s the tetrafluoride prf is also known and is produced by reacting a mixture of sodium fluoride and praseodymium iii fluoride with fluorine gas producing na prf following which sodium fluoride is removed from the reaction mixture with liquid hydrogen fluoride additionally praseodymium forms a bronze diiodide like the diiodides of lanthanum cerium and gadolinium it is a praseodymium iii electride compound praseodymium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the chartreuse pr ions which exist as pr h o complexes pr s h so aq pr aq so aq h g dissolving praseodymium iv compounds in water does not result in solutions containing the yellow pr ions because of the high positive standard reduction potential of the pr pr couple at v these ions are unstable in aqueous solution oxidising water and being reduced to pr the value for the pr pr couple is v however in highly basic aqueous media pr ions can be generated by oxidation with ozone although praseodymium v in the bulk state is unknown the existence of praseodymium in its oxidation state with the stable electron configuration of the preceding noble gas xenon under noble gas matrix isolation conditions was reported in the species assigned to the state were identified as pro its o and ar adducts and pro o organopraseodymium compounds organopraseodymium compounds are very similar to those of the other lanthanides as they all share an inability to undergo backbonding they are thus mostly restricted to the mostly ionic cyclopentadienides isostructural with those of lanthanum and the bonded simple alkyls and aryls some of which may be polymeric the coordination chemistry of praseodymium is largely that of the large electropositive pr ion and is thus largely similar to those of the other early lanthanides la ce and nd for instance like lanthanum cerium and neodymium praseodymium nitrates form both and complexes with crown whereas the middle lanthanides from promethium to gadolinium can only form the complex and the later lanthanides from terbium to lutetium cannot successfully coordinate to all the ligands such praseodymium complexes have high but uncertain coordination numbers and poorly defined stereochemistry with exceptions resulting from exceptionally bulky ligands such as the tricoordinate pr n sime there are also a few mixed oxides and fluorides involving praseodymium iv but it does not have an appreciable coordination chemistry in this oxidation state like its neighbour cerium however the first example of a molecular complex of praseodymium iv has recently been reported history in the swedish mineralogist axel fredrik cronstedt discovered a heavy mineral from the mine at bastn s later named cerite thirty years later the fifteen year old wilhelm hisinger from the family owning the mine sent a sample of it to carl scheele who did not find any new elements within in after hisinger had become an ironmaster he returned to the mineral with j ns jacob berzelius and isolated a new oxide which they named ceria after the dwarf planet ceres which had been discovered two years earlier ceria was simultaneously and independently isolated in germany by martin heinrich klaproth between and ceria was shown to be a mixture of oxides by the swedish surgeon and chemist carl gustaf mosander who lived in the same house as berzelius he separated out two other oxides which he named lanthana and didymia he partially decomposed a sample of cerium nitrate by roasting it in air and then treating the resulting oxide with dilute nitric acid the metals that formed these oxides were thus named lanthanum and didymium while lanthanum turned out to be a pure element didymium was not and turned out to be only a mixture of all the stable early lanthanides from praseodymium to europium as had been suspected by marc delafontaine after spectroscopic analysis though he lacked the time to pursue its separation into its constituents the heavy pair of samarium and europium were only removed in by paul mile lecoq de boisbaudran and it was not until that carl auer von welsbach separated didymium into praseodymium and neodymium von welsbach confirmed the separation by spectroscopic analysis but the products were of relatively low purity since neodymium was a larger constituent of didymium than praseodymium it kept the old name with disambiguation while praseodymium was distinguished by the leek green colour of its salts greek leek green the composite nature of didymium had previously been suggested in by bohuslav brauner who did not experimentally pursue its separation occurrence and production praseodymium is not particularly rare despite it being in the rare earth metals making up mg kg of the earth s crust this value is between those of thorium mg kg and samarium mg kg and makes praseodymium the fourth most abundant of the lanthanides behind cerium mg kg neodymium mg kg and lanthanum mg kg it is less abundant than the rare earth elements yttrium mg kg and scandium mg kg instead praseodymium s classification as a rare earth metal comes from its rarity relative to common earths such as lime and magnesia the few known minerals containing it for which extraction is commercially viable as well as the length and complexity of extraction although not particularly rare praseodymium is never found as a dominant rare earth in praseodymium bearing minerals it is always preceded by cerium and lanthanum and usually also by neodymium the pr ion is similar in size to the early lanthanides of the cerium group those from lanthanum up to samarium and europium that immediately follow in the periodic table and hence it tends to occur along with them in phosphate silicate and carbonate minerals such as monazite miiipo and bastn site miiico f where m refers to all the rare earth metals except scandium and the radioactive promethium mostly ce la and y with somewhat less nd and pr bastn site is usually lacking in thorium and the heavy lanthanides and the purification of the light lanthanides from it is less involved the ore after being crushed and ground is first treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid evolving carbon dioxide hydrogen fluoride and silicon tetrafluoride the product is then dried and leached with water leaving the early lanthanide ions including lanthanum in solution the procedure for monazite which usually contains all the rare earth as well as thorium is more involved monazite because of its magnetic properties can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation after separation it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water soluble sulfates of rare earth the acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to ph during which thorium precipitates as hydroxide and is removed the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earth to their insoluble oxalates the oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing and the oxides are dissolved in nitric acid this last step excludes one of the main components cerium whose oxide is insoluble in hno care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain ra the daughter of th which is a strong gamma emitter praseodymium may then be separated from the other lanthanides via ion exchange chromatography or by using a solvent such as tributyl phosphate where the solubility of ln increases as the atomic number increases if ion exchange chromatography is used the mixture of lanthanides is loaded into one column of cation exchange resin and cu or zn or fe is loaded into the other an aqueous solution of a complexing agent known as the eluant usually triammonium edtate is passed through the columns and ln is displaced from the first column and redeposited in a compact band at the top of the column before being re displaced by nh the gibbs free energy of formation for ln edta h complexes increases along with the lanthanides by about one quarter from ce to lu so that the ln cations descend the development column in a band and are fractionated repeatedly eluting from heaviest to lightest they are then precipitated as their insoluble oxalates burned to form the oxides and then reduced to metals applications leo moser son of ludwig moser founder of the moser glassworks in what is now karlovy vary in the czech republic not to be confused with the mathematician of the same name investigated the use of praseodymium in glass coloration in the late s yielding a yellow green glass given the name prasemit however at that time far cheaper colorants could give a similar color so prasemit was not popular few pieces were made and examples are now extremely rare moser also blended praseodymium with neodymium to produce heliolite glass heliolit in german which was more widely accepted the first enduring commercial use of purified praseodymium which continues today is in the form of a yellow orange praseodymium yellow stain for ceramics which is a solid solution in the zircon lattice this stain has no hint of green in it by contrast at sufficiently high loadings praseodymium glass is distinctly green rather than pure yellow like many other lanthanides praseodymium s shielded f orbitals allow for long excited state lifetimes and high luminescence yields pr as a dopant ion therefore sees many applications in optics and photonics these include dpss lasers single mode fiber optical amplifiers fiber lasers upconverting nanoparticles as well as activators in red green blue and ultraviolet phosphors silicate crystals doped with praseodymium ions have also been used to slow a light pulse down to a few hundred meters per second as the lanthanides are so similar praseodymium can substitute for most other lanthanides without significant loss of function and indeed many applications such as mischmetal and ferrocerium alloys involve variable mixes of several lanthanides including small quantities of praseodymium the following more modern applications involve praseodymium specifically or at least praseodymium in a small subset of the lanthanides in combination with neodymium another rare earth element praseodymium is used to create high power magnets notable for their strength and durability in general most alloys of the cerium group rare earths lanthanum through samarium with d transition metals give extremely stable magnets that are often used in small equipment such as motors printers watches headphones loudspeakers and magnetic storage praseodymium nickel intermetallic prni has such a strong magnetocaloric effect that it has allowed scientists to approach within one thousandth of a degree of absolute zero as an alloying agent with magnesium to create high strength metals that are used in aircraft engines yttrium and neodymium are also viable substitutes praseodymium is present in the rare earth mixture whose fluoride forms the core of carbon arc lights which are used in the motion picture industry for studio lighting and projector lights praseodymium compounds give glasses enamels and ceramics a yellow color praseodymium is a component of didymium glass which is used to make certain types of welder s and glass blower s goggles praseodymium oxide in solid solution with ceria or ceria zirconia has been used as an oxidation catalyst due to its role in permanent magnets used for wind turbines it has been argued that praseodymium will be one of the main objects of geopolitical competition in a world running on renewable energy however this perspective has been criticized for failing to recognize that most wind turbines do not use permanent magnets and for underestimating the power of economic incentives for expanded production biological role and precautions the early lanthanides have been found to be essential to some methanotrophic bacteria living in volcanic mudpots such as methylacidiphilum fumariolicum lanthanum cerium praseodymium and neodymium are about equally effective praseodymium is otherwise not known to have a biological role in any other organisms but it is not very toxic either intravenous injection of rare earths into animals has been known to impair liver function but the main side effects from inhalation of rare earth oxides in humans come from radioactive thorium and uranium impurities ,59
Neodymium,Nd,neodymium is a chemical element with the symbol nd and atomic number it is the fourth member of the lanthanide series and is considered to be one of the rare earth metals it is a hard slightly malleable silvery metal that quickly tarnishes in air and moisture when oxidized neodymium reacts quickly producing pink purple blue and yellow compounds in the and oxidation states it is generally regarded as having one of the most complex spectra of the elements neodymium was discovered in by the austrian chemist carl auer von welsbach who also discovered praseodymium it is present in significant quantities in the minerals monazite and bastn site neodymium is not found naturally in metallic form or unmixed with other lanthanides and it is usually refined for general use neodymium is fairly common about as common as cobalt nickel or copper and is widely distributed in the earth s crust most of the world s commercial neodymium is mined in china as is the case with many other rare earth metals neodymium compounds were first commercially used as glass dyes in and remain a popular additive the color of neodymium compounds comes from the nd ion and is often a reddish purple however this changes with the type of lighting because of the interaction of the sharp light absorption bands of neodymium with ambient light enriched with the sharp visible emission bands of mercury trivalent europium or terbium neodymium doped glasses are used in lasers that emit infrared with wavelengths between and nanometers these lasers have been used in extremely high power applications such as experiments in inertial confinement fusion neodymium is also used with various other substrate crystals such as yttrium aluminium garnet in the nd yag laser neodymium alloys are used to make high strength neodymium magnets a type of powerful permanent magnet these magnets are widely used in products like microphones professional loudspeakers in ear headphones high performance

exists in two allotropic forms with a transformation from a double hexagonal to a body centered cubic structure taking place at about c neodymium like most of the lanthanides is paramagnetic at room temperature and becomes an antiferromagnet upon cooling to k c neodymium is a rare earth metal that was present in the classical mischmetal at a concentration of about to make neodymium magnets it is alloyed with iron which is a ferromagnet electron configuration in the periodic table it appears between the lanthanides praseodymium to its left and the radioactive element promethium to its right and above the actinide uranium its electrons are arranged in the configuration xe f s like most other metals in the lanthanide series neodymium usually only uses three electrons as valence electrons as afterwards the remaining f electrons are strongly bound this is because the f orbitals penetrate the most through the inert xenon core of electrons to the nucleus followed by d and s and this

like other lanthanides usually has the oxidation state but it can also form in the and oxidation states and even in very rare conditions neodymium metal quickly oxidizes at ambient conditions forming

restricted to the mostly ionic cyclopentadienides isostructural with those of lanthanum and the bonded simple alkyls and aryls some of which may be polymeric isotopes naturally occurring neodymium nd is composed of five stable isotopes nd nd nd nd and nd with nd being the most abundant of the natural abundance and two radioisotopes with extremely long half lives nd alpha decay with a half life t of years and nd double beta decay t years in all radioisotopes of neodymium have been detected as of with the most stable radioisotopes being the naturally occurring ones nd and nd all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are shorter than twelve days and the majority of these have half lives that are shorter than seconds the most stable artificial isotope is nd with a half life of days neodymium also has known metastable isotopes with the most stable one being mnd t hours mnd t minutes and m nd t seconds the primary decay modes before the most abundant stable isotope nd are electron capture and positron decay and the primary mode after is beta minus decay the primary decay products before nd are element pr praseodymium isotopes and the primary products after are element pm promethium isotopes four of the five stable isotopes have been predicted to decay to isotopes of cerium or samarium and are only observationally stable additionally some observationally stable isotopes of samarium are predicted to decay to isotopes of neodymium neodymium isotopes are used in various scientific applications nd has been used for the production of short lived tm and yb isotopes nd has been suggested for the production of pm which is a source of radioactive power several neodymium isotopes have been used for the production of other promethium isotopes the decay from sm t to the stable nd allows samarium neodymium dating nd has also been used to study double beta decay history in the swedish mineralogist axel fredrik cronstedt discovered a heavy mineral from the mine at bastn s later named cerite thirty years later fifteen year old wilhelm hisinger a member of the family owning the mine sent a sample to carl scheele who did not find any new

in by carl gustaf mosander von welsbach confirmed the separation by spectroscopic analysis but the products were of relatively low purity didymium was discovered by carl gustaf mosander in and pure neodymium was isolated from it in the name neodymium is derived from the greek words neos new and didymos twin double nitrate crystallization was the means of commercial neodymium purification until the s lindsay chemical division was the first to commercialize large scale ion exchange purification of neodymium starting in the s high purity neodymium was primarily obtained through an ion exchange process from monazite a mineral rich in rare earth elements the metal is obtained through electrolysis of its halide salts currently most neodymium is extracted from bastn site and purified by solvent extraction ion exchange purification is used for the highest purities typically the evolving technology and improved purity of commercially available neodymium oxide was reflected in the appearance of neodymium glasses in collections today early neodymium glasses made in the s have a more reddish or orange tinge than modern versions which are more cleanly purple because of the difficulties in removing traces of praseodymium using early technology namely fractional crystallization because of its role in permanent magnets used for direct drive wind turbines it has been argued that neodymium will be one of the main objects of geopolitical competition in a world running on renewable energy this perspective has been criticised for failing to recognise that most wind turbines do not use permanent magnets and for underestimating the power of economic incentives for expanded production occurrence and production occurrence neodymium is rarely found in nature as a free element instead occurring as ores such as monazite and bastn site these are mineral group names rather than single mineral names that contain small amounts of all rare earth metals in these minerals neodymium is rarely dominant some exceptions include monazite nd and kozoite nd the main mining areas are in china united states brazil india sri lanka and australia world reserves of neodymium are estimated at eight million tonnes the nd ion is similar in size to the early lanthanides of the cerium group those from lanthanum up to samarium and europium that immediately follow in the periodic table and hence it tends to occur along with them in phosphate silicate and carbonate minerals such as monazite miiipo and bastn site miiico f where m refers to all the rare earth metals except scandium and the

involved the ore after being crushed and ground is first treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid evolving carbon dioxide hydrogen fluoride and silicon tetrafluoride the product is then dried and leached with water leaving the early lanthanide ions including lanthanum in solution in space neodymium s per particle abundance in the solar system is ppb parts per billion this figure is about two thirds of that of platinum but two and a half times more than mercury and nearly five times more than gold the lanthanides are not usually found in space and are much more abundant in the earth s crust in the earth s crust neodymium is classified as a lithophile under the goldschmidt classification meaning that it is generally found combined with oxygen although it belongs to the rare earth metals neodymium is not rare at all its abundance in the earth s crust is about mg kg making it the th most common element it is similar in abundance to lanthanum cerium is the most common rare earth metal followed by neodymium and then lanthanum production the world s production of neodymium was about tons in the bulk of current production is from china historically the chinese government imposed strategic material controls on the element causing large fluctuations in prices the uncertainty of pricing and availability have caused companies particularly japanese ones to create permanent magnets and associated electric motors with fewer rare earth metals however so far they have been unable to eliminate the need for neodymium according to the us geological survey greenland holds the largest reserves of undeveloped rare earth deposits particularly neodymium mining interests clash with native populations at those sites due to the release of radioactive substances during the mining process neodymium is typically of the rare earth content of commercial deposits of the light rare earth element minerals bastn site and monazite with neodymium compounds being the most strongly colored for the trivalent lanthanides it can occasionally dominate the coloration of rare earth minerals when competing chromophores are absent it usually gives a pink coloration outstanding examples of this include monazite crystals from the tin deposits in llallagua bolivia ancylite from mont saint hilaire quebec canada or lanthanite from the saucon valley pennsylvania united states as with neodymium glasses such minerals change their colors under the differing lighting conditions the absorption bands of neodymium interact with the visible emission spectrum of mercury vapor with the unfiltered shortwave uv light causing neodymium containing minerals to reflect a distinctive green color this can be observed with monazite containing sands or bastn site containing ore the demand for mineral resources such as rare earth elements including neodymium and other critical materials has been rapidly increasing owing to the growing human population and industrial development recently the requirement for a low carbon society has led to a significant demand for energy saving technologies such as batteries high efficiency motors renewable energy sources and fuel cells among these technologies permanent magnets are often used to fabricate high efficiency motors with neodymium iron boron magnets nd fe b sintered and bonded magnets hereinafter referred to as ndfeb magnets being the main type of permanent magnet in the market since their invention ndfeb magnets are used in hybrid electric vehicles hevs plug in hybrid electric vehicles phevs electric vehicles evs and fuel cell vehicles fcvs hereinafter referred to as xevs wind turbines home appliances computers and many small consumer electronic devices furthermore they are indispensable for energy savings toward achieving the objectives of the paris agreement the demand for ndfeb magnets is expected to increase significantly in the future applications neodymium has an unusually large specific heat capacity at liquid helium temperatures so is useful in cryocoolers neodymium acetate can be a substitute for the radioactive and toxic uranyl acetate used as a standard contrasting agent in electron microscopy probably because of similarities to ca nd has been reported to promote plant growth rare earth element compounds are frequently used in china as fertilizer samarium neodymium dating is useful for determining the age relationships of rocks and meteorites neodymium isotopes recorded in marine sediments are used to reconstruct changes in past ocean circulation magnets neodymium magnets actually an alloy nd fe b are the strongest permanent magnets known a neodymium magnet of a few tens of grams can lift a thousand times its own weight and can snap together with enough force to break bones these magnets are cheaper lighter and stronger than samarium cobalt magnets however they are not superior in every aspect as neodymium based magnets lose their magnetism at lower temperatures and tend to corrode while samarium cobalt magnets do not neodymium magnets appear in products such as microphones professional loudspeakers in ear headphones guitar and bass guitar pick ups and computer hard disks where low mass small volume or strong magnetic fields are required neodymium is used in the electric motors of hybrid and electric automobiles and in the electricity generators of some designs of commercial wind turbines only wind turbines with permanent magnet generators use neodymium for example drive electric motors of each toyota prius require one kilogram pounds of neodymium per vehicle in physics researchers at radboud university and uppsala university announced they had observed a behavior known as self induced spin glass in the atomic structure of neodymium one of the researchers explained we are specialists in scanning tunneling microscopy it allows us to see the structure of individual atoms and we can resolve the north and south poles of the atoms with this advancement in high precision imaging we were able to discover the behavior in neodymium because we could resolve the incredibly small changes in the magnetic structure neodymium behaves in a complex magnetic way that had not been seen before in a periodic table element glass neodymium glass nd glass is produced by the inclusion of neodymium oxide nd o in the glass melt usually in daylight or incandescent light neodymium glass appears lavender but it appears pale blue under fluorescent lighting neodymium may be used to color glass in delicate shades ranging from pure violet through wine red and warm gray the first commercial use of purified neodymium was in glass coloration starting with experiments by leo moser in november the resulting alexandrite glass remains a signature color of the moser glassworks to this day neodymium glass was widely emulated in the early s by american glasshouses most notably heisey fostoria wisteria cambridge heatherbloom and steuben wisteria and elsewhere e g lalique in france or murano tiffin s twilight remained in production from about to current sources include glassmakers in the czech republic the united states and china the sharp absorption bands of neodymium cause the glass color to change under different lighting conditions being reddish purple under daylight or yellow incandescent light but blue under white fluorescent lighting or greenish under trichromatic lighting this color change phenomenon is highly prized by collectors in combination with gold or selenium red colors are produced since neodymium coloration depends upon forbidden f f transitions deep within the atom there is relatively little influence on the color from the chemical environment so the color is impervious to the thermal history of the glass however for the best color iron containing impurities need to be minimized in the silica used to make the glass the same forbidden nature of the f f transitions makes rare earth colorants less intense than those provided by most d transition elements so more has to be used in a glass to achieve the desired color intensity the original moser recipe used about of neodymium oxide in the glass melt a sufficient quantity such that moser referred to these as being rare earth doped glasses being a strong base that level of neodymium would have affected the melting properties of the glass and the lime content of the glass might have had to be adjusted accordingly light transmitted through neodymium glasses shows unusually sharp absorption bands the glass is used in astronomical work to produce sharp bands by which spectral lines may be calibrated another application is the creation of selective astronomical filters to reduce the effect of light pollution from sodium and fluorescent lighting while passing other colours especially dark red hydrogen alpha emission from nebulae neodymium is also used to remove the green color caused by iron contaminants from glass neodymium is a component of didymium referring to mixture of salts of neodymium and praseodymium used for coloring glass to make welder s and glass blower s goggles the sharp absorption bands obliterate the strong sodium emission at nm the similar absorption of the yellow mercury emission line at nm is the principal cause of the blue color observed for neodymium glass under traditional white fluorescent lighting neodymium and didymium glass are used in color enhancing filters in indoor photography particularly in filtering out the yellow hues from incandescent lighting similarly neodymium glass is becoming widely used more directly in incandescent light bulbs these lamps contain neodymium in the glass to filter out yellow light resulting in a whiter light which is more like sunlight during world war i didymium mirrors were reportedly used to transmit morse code across battlefields similar to its use in glasses neodymium salts are used as a colorant for enamels lasers certain transparent materials with a small concentration of neodymium ions can be used in lasers as gain media for infrared wavelengths nm e g nd yag yttrium aluminium garnet nd yap yttrium aluminium perovskite nd ylf yttrium lithium fluoride nd yvo yttrium orthovanadate and nd glass neodymium doped crystals typically nd yvo generate high powered infrared laser beams which are converted to green laser light in commercial dpss hand held lasers and laser pointers trivalent neodymium ion nd was the first lanthanide from rare earth elements used for the generation of laser radiation the nd cawo laser was developed in historically it was the third laser which was put into operation the first was ruby the second the u caf laser over the years the neodymium laser became one of the most used lasers for application purposes the success of the nd ion lies in the structure of its energy levels and in the spectroscopic properties suitable for the generation of laser radiation in geusic et al demonstrated the operation of neodymium ion in yag matrix y al o it is a four level laser with lower threshold and with excellent mechanical and temperature properties for optical pumping of this material it is possible to use non coherent flashlamp radiation or a coherent diode beam the current laser at the uk atomic weapons establishment awe the helen high energy laser embodying neodymium terawatt neodymium glass laser can access the midpoints of pressure and temperature regions and is used to acquire data for modeling on how density temperature and pressure interact inside warheads helen can create plasmas of around k from which opacity and transmission of radiation are measured neodymium glass solid state lasers are used in extremely high power terawatt scale high energy megajoules multiple beam systems for inertial confinement fusion nd glass lasers are usually frequency tripled to the third harmonic at nm in laser fusion devices substitute for uranyl acetate uranyl acetate has been the standard contrasting agent in transmission electron microscopy tem for decades however its use is increasingly hampered by regulations by governments due to its radioactive properties as well as its high toxicity therefore alternatives are being searched for including lanthanide acetates or platinum blue as well as the use of less defined substances such as oolong tea extract despite these published alternatives uranyl acetate uac is still the standard for em contrasting in the periodic table the vertical ordering of elements in groups is based on the presence of the same number of electrons in their outermost shell which determines their chemical and physical properties because neodymium nd is right above uranium u the chemical properties of uac and ndac would be very similar in binding to tissue in ultrathin sections thus leading to a similar amount of contrast biological role and precautions the early lanthanides have been found to be essential to some methanotrophic bacteria living in volcanic mudpots such as methylacidiphilum fumariolicum lanthanum cerium praseodymium and neodymium are about equally effective neodymium is otherwise not known to have a biological role in any other organisms neodymium metal dust is combustible and therefore an explosion hazard neodymium compounds as with all rare earth metals are of low to moderate toxicity however its toxicity has not been thoroughly investigated neodymium salts are regarded as more toxic if they are soluble than if they are insoluble if they are ingested neodymium dust and salts are very irritating to the eyes and mucous membranes and moderately irritating to skin breathing the dust can cause lung embolisms and accumulated exposure damages the liver neodymium also acts as an anticoagulant especially when given intravenously neodymium magnets have been tested for medical uses such as magnetic braces and bone repair but biocompatibility issues have prevented widespread application commercially available magnets made from neodymium are exceptionally strong and can attract each other from large distances if not handled carefully they come together very quickly and forcefully causing injuries for example there is at least one documented case of a person losing a fingertip when two magnets he was using snapped together from cm away another risk of these powerful magnets is that if more than one magnet is ingested they can pinch soft tissues in the gastrointestinal tract this has led to an estimated emergency room visits and necessitated the recall of the buckyballs line of toys which were construction sets of small neodymium magnets ,60
Promethium,Pm,promethium is a chemical element with the symbol pm and atomic number all of its isotopes are radioactive it is extremely rare with only about grams naturally occurring in earth s crust at any given time promethium is one of only two radioactive elements that are followed in the periodic table by elements with stable forms the other being technetium chemically promethium is a lanthanide promethium shows only one stable oxidation state of in bohuslav brauner suggested that there was a then unknown element with properties intermediate between those of the known elements neodymium and samarium this was confirmed in by henry moseley who having measured the atomic numbers of all the elements then known found that atomic number was missing in two groups one italian and one american claimed to have isolated a sample of element both discoveries were soon proven to be false in during a nuclear experiment conducted at ohio state university a few radioactive nuclides were produced that certainly were not radioisotopes of neodymium or samarium but there was a lack of chemical proof that element was produced and the discovery was not generally recognized promethium was first produced and characterized at oak ridge national laboratory in by the separation and analysis of the fission products of uranium fuel irradiated in a graphite reactor the discoverers proposed the name prometheum the spelling was subsequently changed derived from prometheus the titan in greek mythology who stole fire from mount olympus and brought it down to humans to symbolize both the daring and the possible misuse of mankind s intellect however a sample of the metal was made only in the two sources of natural promethium are rare alpha decays of natural europium producing promethium and spontaneous fission of uranium various isotopes promethium is the most stable promethium isotope but the only isotope with practical applications is promethium chemical compounds of which are used in luminous paint atomic batteries and thickness measurement devices because natural promethium is exceedingly scarce it is typically synthesized by bombarding uranium enriched uranium with thermal neutrons to produce promethium as a fission product properties physical properties a promethium atom has electrons arranged in the configuration xe f s in forming compounds the atom loses its two outermost electrons and one of the f electrons which belongs to an open subshell the element s atomic radius is the second largest among all the lanthanides but is only slightly greater than those of the neighboring elements it is the most notable exception to the general trend of the contraction of lanthanide atoms with the increase of their atomic numbers see lanthanide contraction many properties of promethium rely on its position among lanthanides and are intermediate between those of neodymium and samarium for example the melting point the first three ionization energies and the hydration energy are greater than those of neodymium and lower than those of samarium similarly the estimate for the boiling point ionic pm radius and standard heat of formation of monatomic gas are greater than those of samarium and less than those of neodymium promethium has a double hexagonal close packed dhcp structure and a hardness of kg mm this low temperature alpha form converts into a beta body centered cubic bcc phase upon heating to c chemical properties and compounds promethium belongs to the cerium group of lanthanides and is chemically very similar to the neighboring elements because of its instability chemical studies of promethium are incomplete even though a few compounds have been synthesized they are not fully studied in general they tend to be pink or red in color treatment of acidic solutions containing pm ions with ammonia results in a gelatinous light brown sediment of hydroxide pm oh which is insoluble in water when dissolved in hydrochloric acid a water soluble yellow salt pmcl is produced similarly when dissolved in nitric acid a nitrate results pm no the latter is also well soluble when dried it forms pink crystals similar to nd no the electron configuration for pm is xe f and the color of the ion is pink the ground state term symbol is i the sulfate is slightly soluble like the other cerium group sulfates cell parameters have been calculated for its octahydrate they lead to conclusion that the density of pm so h o is g cm the oxalate pm c o h o has the lowest solubility of all lanthanide oxalates unlike the nitrate the oxide is similar to the corresponding samarium salt and not the neodymium salt as synthesized e g by heating the oxalate it is a white or lavender colored powder with disordered structure this powder crystallizes in a cubic lattice upon heating to c further annealing at c and then at c irreversibly transforms it to monoclinic and hexagonal phases respectively and the last two phases can be interconverted by adjusting the annealing time and temperature promethium forms only one stable oxidation state in the form of ions this is in line with other lanthanides according to its position in the periodic table the element cannot be expected to form stable or oxidation states treating chemical compounds containing pm ions with strong oxidizing or reducing agents showed that the ion is not easily oxidized or reduced isotopes promethium is the only lanthanide and one of only two elements among the first that has no stable or long lived primordial isotopes this is a result of a rarely occurring effect of the liquid drop model and stabilities of neighbor element isotopes it is also the least stable element of the first the primary decay products are neodymium and samarium isotopes promethium decays to both the lighter isotopes generally to neodymium via positron decay and electron capture and the heavier isotopes to samarium via beta decay promethium nuclear isomers may decay to other promethium isotopes and one isotope pm has a very rare alpha decay mode to stable praseodymium the most stable isotope of the element is promethium which has a specific activity of ci g tbq g and a half life of years via electron capture because it has neutrons two more than which is a magic number which corresponds to a stable neutron configuration it may emit an alpha particle which has neutrons to form praseodymium with neutrons thus it is the only promethium isotope with an experimentally observed alpha decay its partial half life for alpha decay is about years and the relative probability for a pm nucleus to decay in this way is several other promethium isotopes such as pm pm and pm also have a positive energy release for alpha decay their alpha decays are predicted to occur but have not been observed in total isotopes of promethium are known ranging from pm to pm the element also has nuclear isomers with mass numbers of to and some mass numbers have more than one isomer the most stable of them is promethium m with a half life of days this is longer than the half lives of the ground states of all promethium isotopes except for promethium to in fact promethium m has a longer half life than its ground state promethium occurrence in willard libby reported that he had found weak beta activity in pure neodymium which was attributed to a half life over years almost years later it was claimed that the element occurs in natural neodymium in equilibrium in quantities below grams of promethium per one gram of neodymium however these observations were disproved by newer investigations because for all seven naturally occurring neodymium isotopes any single beta decays which can produce promethium isotopes are forbidden by energy conservation in particular careful measurements of atomic masses show that the mass difference nd pm is negative kev which absolutely prevents the single beta decay of nd to pm in olavi er mets separated out traces of pm from a rare earth concentrate purified from apatite resulting in an upper limit of for the abundance of promethium in nature this may have been produced by the natural nuclear fission of uranium or by cosmic ray spallation of nd both isotopes of natural europium have larger mass excesses than sums of those of their potential alpha daughters plus that of an alpha particle therefore they stable in practice may alpha decay to promethium research at laboratori nazionali del gran sasso showed that europium decays to promethium with the half life of years it has been shown that europium is responsible for about grams of promethium in the earth s crust alpha decays for europium have not been found yet and its theoretically calculated half life is so high due to low energy of decay that this process will probably not be observed in the near future promethium can also be formed in nature as a product of spontaneous fission of uranium only trace amounts can be found in naturally occurring ores a sample of pitchblende has been found to contain promethium at a concentration of four parts per quintillion by mass uranium is thus responsible for g of promethium in earth s crust promethium has also been identified in the spectrum of the star hr in andromeda it also has been found in hd przybylski s star and hd because of the short half life of promethium isotopes they should be formed near the surface of those stars history searches for element in czech chemist bohuslav brauner found out that the differences in properties between neodymium and samarium were the largest between any two consecutive lanthanides in the sequence then known as a conclusion he suggested there was an element with intermediate properties between them this prediction was supported in by henry moseley who having discovered that atomic number was an experimentally measurable property of elements found that a few atomic numbers had no known corresponding elements the gaps were and with the knowledge of a gap in the periodic table several groups started to search for the predicted element among other rare earths in the natural environment the first claim of a discovery was published by luigi rolla and lorenzo fernandes of florence italy after separating a mixture of a few rare earth elements nitrate concentrate from the brazilian mineral monazite by fractionated crystallization they yielded a solution containing mostly samarium this solution gave x ray spectra attributed to samarium and element in honor of their city they named element florentium the results were published in but the scientists claimed that the experiments were done in also in a group of scientists from the university of illinois at urbana champaign smith hopkins and len yntema published the discovery of element they named it illinium after the university both of these reported discoveries were shown to be erroneous because the spectrum line that corresponded to element was identical to that of didymium the lines thought to belong to element turned out to belong to a few impurities barium chromium and platinum in josef mattauch finally formulated the isobar rule one of the indirect consequences of this rule was that element was unable to form stable isotopes from a nuclear experiment was conducted by h b law et al at the ohio state university nuclides were produced in which were not radioisotopes of neodymium or samarium and the name cyclonium was proposed but there was a lack of chemical proof that element was produced and the discovery not largely recognized discovery and synthesis of promethium metal promethium was first produced and characterized at oak ridge national laboratory clinton laboratories at that time in by jacob a marinsky lawrence e glendenin and charles d coryell by separation and analysis of the fission products of uranium fuel irradiated in the graphite reactor however being too busy with military related research during world war ii they did not announce their discovery until the original proposed name was clintonium after the laboratory where the work was conducted however the name prometheum was suggested by grace mary coryell the wife of one of the discoverers it is derived from prometheus the titan in greek mythology who stole fire from mount olympus and brought it down to humans and symbolizes both the daring and the possible misuse of the mankind intellect the spelling was then changed to promethium as this was in accordance with most other metals in promethium iii fluoride was used to make promethium metal provisionally purified from impurities of samarium neodymium and americium it was put into a tantalum crucible which was located in another tantalum crucible the outer crucible contained lithium metal times excess compared to promethium after creating a vacuum the chemicals were mixed to produce promethium metal pmf li pm lifthe promethium sample produced was used to measure a few of the metal s properties such as its melting point in ion exchange methods were used at ornl to prepare about ten grams of promethium from nuclear reactor fuel processing wastes promethium can be either recovered from the byproducts of uranium fission or produced by bombarding nd with neutrons turning it into nd which decays into pm through beta decay with a half life of days production the production methods for different isotopes vary and only those for promethium are given because it is the only isotope with industrial applications promethium is produced in large quantities compared to other isotopes by bombarding uranium with thermal neutrons the output is relatively high at of the total product another way to produce promethium is via neodymium which decays to promethium with a short half life neodymium can be obtained either by bombarding enriched neodymium with thermal neutrons or by bombarding a uranium carbide target with energetic protons in a particle accelerator another method is to bombard uranium with fast neutrons to cause fast fission which among multiple reaction products creates promethium as early as the s oak ridge national laboratory could produce grams of promethium per year and was the world s only large volume synthesis facility gram scale production of promethium has been discontinued in the u s in the early s but will possibly be resumed after at the high flux isotope reactor in russia was the only country producing promethium on a relatively large scale applications most promethium is used only for research purposes except for promethium which can be found outside laboratories it is obtained as the oxide or chloride in milligram quantities this isotope does not emit gamma rays and its radiation has a relatively small penetration depth in matter and a relatively long half life some signal lights use a luminous paint containing a phosphor that absorbs the beta radiation emitted by promethium and emits light this isotope does not cause aging of the phosphor as alpha emitters do and therefore the light emission is stable for a few years originally radium was used for the purpose but it was later replaced by promethium and tritium hydrogen promethium may be favored over tritium for nuclear safety reasons in atomic batteries the beta particles emitted by promethium are converted into electric current by sandwiching a small promethium source between two semiconductor plates these batteries have a useful lifetime of about five years the first promethium based battery was assembled in and generated a few milliwatts of power from a volume of about cubic inches including shielding promethium is also used to measure the thickness of materials by evaluating the amount of radiation from a promethium source that passes through the sample it has possible future uses in portable x ray sources and as auxiliary heat or power sources for space probes and satellites although the alpha emitter plutonium has become standard for most space exploration related uses promethium is also used albeit in very small quantities less than nci in some philips cfl compact fluorescent lamp glow switches in the plc w w mm cfl range precautions the element has no biological role promethium can emit gamma rays during its beta decay which are dangerous for all lifeforms interactions with tiny quantities of promethium are not hazardous if certain precautions are observed in general gloves footwear covers safety glasses and an outer layer of easily removed protective clothing should be used it is not known what human organs are affected by interaction with promethium a possible candidate is the bone tissues sealed promethium is not dangerous however if the packaging is damaged then promethium becomes dangerous to the environment and humans if radioactive contamination is found the contaminated area should be washed with water and soap but even though promethium mainly affects the skin the skin should not be abraded if a promethium leak is found the area should be identified as hazardous and evacuated and emergency services must be contacted no dangers from promethium aside from the radioactivity are known ,61
Samarium,Sm,samarium is a chemical element with symbol sm and atomic number it is a moderately hard silvery metal that slowly oxidizes in air being a typical member of the lanthanide series samarium usually has the oxidation state compounds of samarium ii are also known most notably the monoxide smo monochalcogenides sms smse and smte as well as samarium ii iodide the last compound is a common reducing agent in chemical synthesis samarium has no significant biological role but is slightly toxic samarium was discovered in by french chemist paul mile lecoq de boisbaudran and named after the mineral samarskite from which it was isolated the mineral itself was named after a russian mine official colonel vassili samarsky bykhovets who thus became the first person to have a chemical element named after him albeit indirectly though classified as a rare earth element samarium is the th most abundant element in earth s crust and more common than metals such as tin samarium occurs in concentration up to in several minerals including cerite gadolinite samarskite monazite and bastn site the last two being the most common commercial sources of the element these minerals are mostly found in china the united states brazil india sri lanka and australia china is by far the world leader in samarium mining and production the main commercial use of samarium is in samarium cobalt magnets which have permanent magnetization second only to neodymium magnets however samarium compounds can withstand significantly higher temperatures above c f without losing their magnetic properties due to the alloy s higher curie point the radioisotope samarium is the active component of the drug samarium sm lexidronam quadramet which kills cancer cells in lung cancer prostate cancer breast cancer and osteosarcoma another isotope samarium is a strong neutron absorber and so is added to control rods of nuclear reactors it also forms as a decay product during the reactor operation and is one of the important factors considered in the reactor design and operation other uses of samarium include catalysis of chemical reactions radioactive dating and x ray lasers physical properties samarium is a rare earth element with hardness and density similar to zinc with boiling point c samarium is the third most volatile lanthanide after ytterbium and europium this helps separation of samarium from ore at ambient conditions samarium normally has a rhombohedral structure form upon heating to c its crystal symmetry changes to hexagonal close packed hcp but transition temperature depends on metal purity further heating to c transforms the metal into a body centered cubic bcc phase heating to c plus compression to kbar results in a double hexagonally close packed structure dhcp higher pressure of the order of hundreds or thousands of kilobars induces a series of phase transformations in particular with a tetragonal phase appearing at about kbar in one study the dhcp phase could be produced without compression using a nonequilibrium annealing regime with a rapid temperature change between about and c confirming the transient character of this samarium phase also thin films of samarium obtained by vapor deposition may contain the hcp or dhcp phases at ambient conditions samarium and its sesquioxide are paramagnetic at room temperature their corresponding effective magnetic moments below b are the rd lowest among lanthanides and their oxides after lanthanum and lutetium the metal transforms to an antiferromagnetic state upon cooling to k individual samarium atoms can be isolated by encapsulating them into fullerene molecules they can also be doped between the c molecules in the fullerene solid rendering it superconductive at temperatures below k samarium doping of iron based superconductors the most recent class of high temperature superconductor allows enhancing their transition temperature to k which is the highest value achieved so far in this series chemical properties freshly prepared samarium has a silvery luster in air it slowly oxidizes at room temperature and spontaneously ignites at c even when stored under mineral oil samarium gradually oxidizes and develops a grayish yellow powder of the oxide hydroxide mixture at the surface the metallic appearance of a sample can be preserved by sealing it under an inert gas such as argon samarium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form samarium hydroxide sm s h o l sm oh aq h g samarium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the yellow to pale green sm iii ions which exist as sm oh complexes sm s h so aq sm aq so aq h g samarium is one of the few lanthanides that exhibit oxidation state sm ions are blood red in aqueous solution compounds oxides the most stable oxide of samarium is the sesquioxide sm o like many samarium compounds it exists in several crystalline phases the trigonal form is obtained by slow cooling from the melt the melting point of sm o is high c so it is usually melted not by direct heating but with induction heating through a radio frequency coil sm o crystals of monoclinic symmetry can be grown by the flame fusion method verneuil process from sm o powder that yields cylindrical boules up to several centimeters long and about one centimeter in diameter the boules are transparent when pure and defect free and are orange otherwise heating the metastable trigonal sm o to c converts it to the more stable monoclinic phase cubic sm o has also been described samarium is one of the few lanthanides that form a monoxide smo this lustrous golden yellow compound was obtained by reducing sm o with samarium metal at high temperature c and pressure above kbar lowering the pressure resulted in incomplete reaction smo has cubic rock salt lattice structure chalcogenides samarium forms a trivalent sulfide selenide and telluride divalent chalcogenides sms smse and smte with cubic rock salt crystal structure are also known they are remarkable by converting from semiconducting to metallic state at room temperature upon application of pressure whereas the transition is continuous and occurs at about kbar in smse and smte it is abrupt in sms and requires only kbar this effect results in spectacular color change in sms from black to golden yellow when its crystals of films are scratched or polished the transition does not change lattice symmetry but there is a sharp decrease in the crystal volume it exhibits hysteresis i e when the pressure is released sms returns to the semiconducting state at a much lower pressure of about kbar halides samarium metal reacts with all the halogens forming trihalides sm s x g smx s x f cl br or i their further reduction with samarium lithium or sodium metals at elevated temperatures about c yields dihalides the diiodide can also be prepared by heating smi or by reacting the metal with diiodoethane in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran at room temperature sm s ich ch i smi ch ch in addition to dihalides the reduction also produces many non stoichiometric samarium halides with a well defined crystal structure such as sm f sm f sm f sm br sm br and sm br as reflected in the table above samarium halides change their crystal structures when one type of halide atom is substituted for another which is an uncommon behavior for most elements e g actinides many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition one being significantly more stable and another being metastable the latter is formed upon compression or heating followed by quenching to ambient conditions for example compressing the usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing the pressure results in a pbcl type orthorhombic structure density g cm and similar treatment results in a new phase of samarium triiodide density g cm borides sintering powders of samarium oxide and boron in vacuum yields a powder containing several samarium boride phases and their volume ratio can be controlled through the mixing proportion the powder can be converted into larger crystals of a certain samarium boride using arc melting or zone melting techniques relying on the different melting crystallization temperature of smb c smb about c and smb c all these materials are hard brittle dark gray solids with the hardness increasing with the boron content samarium diboride is too volatile to be produced with these methods and requires high pressure about kbar and low temperatures between and c to stabilize its growth increasing the temperature results in the preferential formations of smb samarium hexaboride samarium hexaboride is a typical intermediate valence compound where samarium is present both as sm and sm ions in a ratio it belongs to a class of kondo insulators that is at high temperatures above k its properties are typical of a kondo metal with metallic electrical conductivity characterized by strong electron scattering whereas at low temperatures it behaves as a non magnetic insulator with a narrow band gap of about mev the cooling induced metal insulator transition in smb is accompanied by a sharp increase in the thermal conductivity peaking at about k the reason for this increase is that electrons themselves do not contribute to the thermal conductivity at low temperatures which is dominated by phonons but the decrease in electron concentration reduced the rate of electron phonon scattering new research seems to show that it may be a topological insulator other inorganic compounds samarium carbides are prepared by melting a graphite metal mixture in an inert atmosphere after the synthesis they are unstable in air and are studied also under inert atmosphere samarium monophosphide smp is a semiconductor with the bandgap of ev the same as in silicon and high electrical conductivity of n type it can be prepared by annealing at c an evacuated quartz ampoule containing mixed powders of phosphorus and samarium phosphorus is highly volatile at high temperatures and may explode thus the heating rate has to be kept well below c min similar procedure is adopted for the monarsenide smas but the synthesis temperature is higher at c numerous crystalline binary compounds are known for samarium and one of the group or element x where x is si ge sn pb sb or te and metallic alloys of samarium form another large group they are all prepared by annealing mixed powders of the corresponding elements many of the resulting compounds are non stoichiometric and have nominal compositions smaxb where the b a ratio varies between and organometallic compounds samarium forms a cyclopentadienide sm c h and its chloroderivatives sm c h cl and sm c h cl they are prepared by reacting samarium trichloride with nac h in tetrahydrofuran contrary to cyclopentadienides of most other lanthanides in sm c h some c h rings bridge each other by forming ring vertexes or edges toward another neighboring samarium thus creating polymeric chains the chloroderivative sm c h cl has a dimer structure which is more accurately expressed as c h sm cl c h there the chlorine bridges can be replaced for instance by iodine hydrogen or nitrogen atoms or by cn groups the c h ion in samarium cyclopentadienides can be replaced by the indenide c h or cyclooctatetraenide c h ring resulting in sm c h or ksm c h the latter compound has a structure similar to uranocene there is also a cyclopentadienide of divalent samarium sm c h a solid that sublimates at about c contrary to ferrocene the c h rings in sm c h are not parallel but are tilted by a metathesis reaction in tetrahydrofuran or ether gives alkyls and aryls of samarium smcl lir smr licl sm or lich sime sm ch sime liorhere r is a hydrocarbon group and me methyl isotopes naturally occurring samarium is composed of five stable isotopes sm sm sm sm and sm and two extremely long lived radioisotopes sm half life t years and sm years with sm being the most abundant sm is listed by various sources either as stable or radioactive but only a lower bound for its half life is given some observationally stable samarium isotopes are predicted to decay to isotopes of neodymium the long lived isotopes sm sm and sm primarily alpha decay to neodymium lighter unstable isotopes of samarium mainly decay by electron capture to promethium while heavier ones beta decay to europium natural samarium has a radioactivity of bq g mostly due to sm sm can be used as an extinct radionuclide in radiometric dating the alpha decay of sm to nd with a half life of years is used in samarium neodymium dating the half lives of sm and sm are years and days respectively all remaining radioisotopes which range from sm to sm have half lives that are less than days and most these have half life less than seconds samarium also has twelve known nuclear isomers the most stable of which are msm half life minutes m sm t seconds and msm t seconds history detection of samarium and related elements was announced by several scientists in the second half of the th century however most sources give priority to french chemist paul mile lecoq de boisbaudran boisbaudran isolated samarium oxide and or hydroxide in paris in from the mineral samarskite y ce u fe nb ta ti o and identified a new element in it via sharp optical absorption lines swiss chemist marc delafontaine announced a new element decipium from latin decipiens meaning deceptive misleading in but later in demonstrated that it was a mix of several elements one being identical to boisbaudran s samarium though samarskite was first found in the remote russian region of urals by the late s it had been found in other places making it available to many researchers in particular it was found that the samarium isolated by boisbaudran was also impure and had a comparable amount of europium the pure element was produced only in by eug ne anatole demar ay boisbaudran named his element samaria after the mineral samarskite which in turn honored vassili samarsky bykhovets samarsky bykhovets as the chief of staff of the russian corps of mining engineers had granted access for two german mineralogists the brothers gustav and heinrich rose to study the mineral samples from the urals samarium was thus the first chemical element to be named after a person later the name samaria used by boisbaudran became samarium to conform with other element names samaria is now sometimes used to mean samarium oxide by analogy with yttria zirconia alumina ceria holmia etc the symbol sm was suggested for samarium but an alternative sa was often used instead until the s before the advent of ion exchange separation technology in the s pure samarium had no commercial uses however a by product of fractional crystallization purification of neodymium was a mix of samarium and gadolinium that got the name lindsay mix after the company that made it this material is thought to have been used for nuclear control rods in some early nuclear reactors nowadays a similar commodity product has the name samarium europium gadolinium seg concentrate it is prepared by solvent extraction from the mixed lanthanides isolated from bastn site or monazite since heavier lanthanides have more affinity for the solvent used they are easily extracted from the bulk using relatively small proportions of solvent not all rare earth producers who process bastn site do so on a large enough scale to continue by separating the components of seg which typically makes up only of the original ore such producers therefore make seg with a view to marketing it to the specialized processors in this manner the valuable europium in the ore is rescued for use in making phosphor samarium purification follows the removal of the europium as of being in oversupply samarium oxide is cheaper on a commercial scale than its relative abundance in the ore might suggest occurrence and production with the average concentration of about parts per million ppm samarium is the th most abundant element in the earth s crust it is the fifth most abundant lanthanide and is more common than elements such as tin samarium concentration in soils varies between and ppm and oceans contain about parts per trillion distribution of samarium in soils strongly depends on its chemical state and is very inhomogeneous in sandy soils samarium concentration is about times higher at the surface of soil particles than in the water trapped between them and this ratio can exceed in clays samarium is not found free in nature but like other rare earth elements is contained in many minerals including monazite bastn site cerite gadolinite and samarskite monazite in which samarium occurs at concentrations of up to and bastn site are mostly used as commercial sources world resources of samarium are estimated at two million tonnes they are mostly located in china us brazil india sri lanka and australia and the annual production is about tonnes country production reports are usually given for all rare earth metals combined by far china has the largest production with tonnes mined per year it is followed by the us about tonnes and india tonnes samarium is usually sold as oxide which at the price of about us kg is one of the cheapest lanthanide oxides whereas mischmetal a mixture of rare earth metals containing about of samarium has long been used relatively pure samarium has been isolated only recently through ion exchange processes solvent extraction techniques and electrochemical deposition the metal is often prepared by electrolysis of a molten mixture of samarium iii chloride with sodium chloride or calcium chloride samarium can also be obtained by reducing its oxide with lanthanum the product is then distilled to separate samarium boiling point c and lanthanum b p c domination of samarium in minerals is unique minerals with essential dominant samarium include monazite sm and florencite sm they are very rare samarium is produced in nuclear fission of uranium with a yield of about of all fissions it is also made by neutron capture by samarium which is added to the control rods of nuclear reactors therefore sm is present in spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste applications one of the most important uses of samarium is samarium cobalt magnets which are nominally smco or sm co they have high permanent magnetization about times that of iron and second only to neodymium magnets but samarium magnets resist demagnetization better they are stable to temperatures above c cf c for neodymium magnets these magnets are found in small motors headphones and high end magnetic pickups for guitars and related musical instruments for example they are used in the motors of a solar powered electric aircraft the solar challenger and in the samarium cobalt noiseless electric guitar and bass pickups another important use of samarium and its compounds is as catalyst and chemical reagent samarium catalysts help decomposition of plastics dechlorination of pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcb as well as dehydration and dehydrogenation of ethanol samarium iii triflate sm otf that is sm cf so is one of the most efficient lewis acid catalysts for a halogen promoted friedel crafts reaction with alkenes samarium ii iodide is a very common reducing and coupling agent in organic synthesis for example in desulfonylation reactions annulation danishefsky kuwajima mukaiyama and holton taxol total syntheses strychnine total synthesis barbier reaction and other reductions with samarium ii iodide in its usual oxidized form samarium is added to ceramics and glasses where it increases absorption of infrared light as a minor part of mischmetal samarium is found in flint ignition device of many lighters and torches samarium is a beta emitter with half life hours it is used to kill cancer cells in lung cancer prostate cancer breast cancer and osteosarcoma for this purpose samarium is chelated with ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate edtmp and injected intravenously the chelation prevents accumulation of radioactive samarium in the body that would result in excessive irradiation and generation of new cancer cells the corresponding drug has several names including samarium sm lexidronam its trade name is quadramet samarium has high cross section for neutron capture barns and so is used in control rods of nuclear reactors its advantage compared to competing materials such as boron and cadmium is stability of absorption most of the fusion products of sm are other isotopes of samarium that are also good neutron absorbers for example the cross section of samarium is barns it is on the order of hundreds of barns for sm sm and sm and barns for natural mixed isotope samarium among the decay products in a nuclear reactor sm is regarded as the second most important for the reactor design and operation after xenon samarium hexaboride smb has recently been shown to be a topological insulator with potential uses in quantum computing non commercial and potential uses samarium doped calcium fluoride crystals were used as an active medium in one of the first solid state lasers designed and built by peter sorokin co inventor of the dye laser and mirek stevenson at ibm research labs in early this samarium laser gave pulses of red light at nm it had to be cooled by liquid helium and so did not find practical applications another samarium based laser became the first saturated x ray laser operating at wavelengths shorter than nanometers it gave picosecond pulses at and nm suitable for uses in holography high resolution microscopy of biological specimens deflectometry interferometry and radiography of dense plasmas related to confinement fusion and astrophysics saturated operation meant that the maximum possible power was extracted from the lasing medium resulting in the high peak energy of mj the active medium was samarium plasma produced by irradiating samarium coated glass with a pulsed infrared nd glass laser wavelength m the change in electrical resistivity in samarium monochalcogenides can be used in a pressure sensor or in a memory device triggered between a low resistance and high resistance state by external pressure and such devices are being developed commercially samarium monosulfide also generates electric voltage upon moderate heating to about c that can be applied in thermoelectric power converters analysis of relative concentrations of samarium and neodymium isotopes sm nd and nd allows determination of age and origin of rocks and meteorites in samarium neodymium dating both elements are lanthanides and are very similar physically and chemically thus sm nd dating is either insensitive to partitioning of the marker elements during various geologic processes or such partitioning can well be understood and modeled from the ionic radii of said elements sm ion is a potential activator for use in warm white light emitting diodes it offers high luminous efficacy due to the narrow emission bands but the generally low quantum efficiency and too little absorption in the uv a to blue spectral region hinders commercial application in recent years it has been shown that nanocrystalline bafcl sm as prepared by co precipitation can serve as a very efficient x ray storage phosphor the co precipitation leads to nanocrystallites of the order of nm in size and their sensitivity as x ray storage phosphors is increased an astounding times because of the specific arrangements and density of defect centres in comparison with microcrystalline samples prepared by sintering at high temperature the mechanism is based on reduction of sm to sm by trapping electrons that are created upon exposure to ionizing radiation in the bafcl host the dj fj f f luminescence lines can be very efficiently excited via the parity allowed f f d transition at nm the latter wavelength is ideal for efficient excitation by blue violet laser diodes as the transition is electric dipole allowed and thus relatively intense l mol cm the phosphor has potential applications in personal dosimetry dosimetry and imaging in radiotherapy and medical imaging samarium is used for ionosphere testing a rocket spreads it as a red vapor at high altitude and researchers tests how the atmosphere disperses it and how it impacts radio transmissions biological role and precautions samarium salts stimulate metabolism but it is unclear whether this is from samarium or other lanthanides present with it the total amount of samarium in adults is about g mostly in liver and kidneys and with g l being dissolved in blood samarium is not absorbed by plants to a measurable concentration and so is normally not part of human diet however a few plants and vegetables may contain up to part per million of samarium insoluble salts of samarium are non toxic and the soluble ones are only slightly toxic when ingested only of samarium salts is absorbed into the bloodstream and the remainder is excreted from the blood goes to the liver and is deposited on the surface of the bones where it remains for years the balance is excreted ,62
Europium,Eu,europium is a chemical element with the symbol eu and atomic number europium is the most reactive lanthanide by far having to be stored under an inert fluid to protect it from atmospheric oxygen or moisture europium is also the softest lanthanide as it can be dented with a fingernail and easily cut with a knife when oxidation is removed a shiny white metal is visible europium was isolated in and is named after the continent of europe being a typical member of the lanthanide series europium usually assumes the oxidation state but the oxidation state is also common all europium compounds with oxidation state are slightly reducing europium has no significant biological role and is relatively non toxic as compared to other heavy metals most applications of europium exploit the phosphorescence of europium compounds europium is one of the rarest of the rare earth elements on earth characteristics physical properties europium is a ductile metal with a hardness similar to that of lead it crystallizes in a body centered cubic lattice some properties of europium are strongly influenced by its half filled electron shell europium has the second lowest melting point and the lowest density of all lanthanides europium has been claimed to become a superconductor when it is cooled below k and compressed to above gpa however the experimental evidence on which this claim is based has been challenged and the paper reporting superconductivity has been subsequently retracted if it becomes a superconductor this is believed to occur because europium is divalent in the metallic state and is converted into the trivalent state by the applied pressure in the divalent state the strong local magnetic moment j suppresses the superconductivity which is induced by eliminating this local moment j in eu chemical properties europium is the most reactive rare earth element it rapidly oxidizes in air so that bulk oxidation of a centimeter sized sample occurs within several days its reactivity with water is comparable to that of calcium and the reaction is eu h o eu oh h because of the high reactivity samples of solid europium rarely have the shiny appearance of the fresh metal even when coated with a protective layer of mineral oil europium ignites in air at to c to form europium iii oxide eu o eu o europium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form pale pink solutions of eu h o eu h so h o eu h o so h eu ii vs eu iii although usually trivalent europium readily forms divalent compounds this behavior is unusual for most lanthanides which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of the state has an electron configuration f because the half filled f shell provides more stability in terms of size and coordination number europium ii and barium ii are similar the sulfates of both barium and europium ii are also highly insoluble in water divalent europium is a mild reducing agent oxidizing in air to form eu iii compounds in anaerobic and particularly geothermal conditions the divalent form is sufficiently stable that it tends to be incorporated into minerals of calcium and the other alkaline earths this ion exchange process is the basis of the negative europium anomaly the low europium content in many lanthanide minerals such as monazite relative to the chondritic abundance bastn site tends to show less of a negative europium anomaly than does monazite and hence is the major source of europium today the development of easy methods to separate divalent europium from the other trivalent lanthanides made europium accessible even when present in low concentration as it usually is isotopes naturally occurring europium is composed of two isotopes eu and eu which occur in almost equal proportions eu is slightly more abundant natural abundance while eu is stable eu was found to be unstable to alpha decay with a half life of years in giving about one alpha decay per two minutes in every kilogram of natural europium this value is in reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions besides the natural radioisotope eu artificial radioisotopes have been characterized the most stable being eu with a half life of years eu with a half life of years and eu with a half life of years all the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives shorter than years and the majority of these have half lives shorter than seconds the known isotopes of europium range from eu to eu this element also has meta states with the most stable being meu t hours m eu t hours and m eu t minutes the primary decay mode for isotopes lighter than eu is electron capture and the primary mode for heavier isotopes is beta minus decay the primary decay products before eu are isotopes of samarium sm and the primary products after are isotopes of gadolinium gd europium as a nuclear fission product europium is produced by nuclear fission but the fission product yields of europium isotopes are low near the top of the mass range for fission products as with other lanthanides many isotopes of europium especially those that have odd mass numbers or are neutron poor like eu have high cross sections for neutron capture often high enough to be neutron poisons eu is the beta decay product of samarium but since this has a long decay half life and short mean time to neutron absorption most sm instead ends up as sm eu half life years and eu half life years cannot be beta decay products because sm and sm are non radioactive but eu is the only long lived shielded nuclide other than cs to have a fission yield of more than parts per million fissions a larger amount of eu is produced by neutron activation of a significant portion of the non radioactive eu however much of this is further converted to eu eu half life years has a fission yield of parts per million ppm for uranium and thermal neutrons most of it is transmuted to non radioactive and nonabsorptive gadolinium by the end of fuel burnup overall europium is overshadowed by caesium and strontium as a radiation hazard and by samarium and others as a neutron poison occurrence europium is not found in nature as a free element many minerals contain europium with the most important sources being bastn site monazite xenotime and loparite ce no europium dominant minerals are known yet despite a single find of a tiny possible eu o or eu o c system phase in the moon s regolith depletion or enrichment of europium in minerals relative to other rare earth elements is known as the europium anomaly europium is commonly included in trace element studies in geochemistry and petrology to understand the processes that form igneous rocks rocks that cooled from magma or lava the nature of the europium anomaly found helps reconstruct the relationships within a suite of igneous rocks the average crustal abundance of europium is ppm divalent europium eu in small amounts is the activator of the bright blue fluorescence of some samples of the mineral fluorite caf the reduction from eu to eu is induced by irradiation with energetic particles the most outstanding examples of this originated around weardale and adjacent parts of northern england it was the fluorite found here that fluorescence was named after in although it was not until much later that europium was determined to be the cause in astrophysics the signature of europium in stellar spectra can be used to classify stars and inform theories of how or where a particular star was born for instance astronomers in identified higher than expected levels of europium within the star j hypothesizing that this star originated in a dwarf galaxy that collided with the milky way billions of years ago production europium is associated with the other rare earth elements and is therefore mined together with them separation of the rare earth elements occurs during later processing rare earth elements are found in the minerals bastn site loparite ce xenotime and monazite in mineable quantities bastn site is a group of related fluorocarbonates ln co f oh monazite is a group of related of orthophosphate minerals lnpo ln denotes a mixture of all the lanthanides except promethium loparite ce is an oxide and xenotime is an orthophosphate y yb er po monazite also contains thorium and yttrium which complicates handling because thorium and its decay products are radioactive for the extraction from the ore and the isolation of individual lanthanides several methods have been developed the choice of method is based on the concentration and composition of the ore and on the distribution of the individual lanthanides in the resulting concentrate roasting the ore followed by acidic and basic leaching is used mostly to produce a concentrate of lanthanides if cerium is the dominant lanthanide then it is converted from cerium iii to cerium iv and then precipitated further separation by solvent extractions or ion exchange chromatography yields a fraction which is enriched in europium this fraction is reduced with zinc zinc amalgam electrolysis or other methods converting the europium iii to europium ii europium ii reacts in a way similar to that of alkaline earth metals and therefore it can be precipitated as a carbonate or co precipitated with barium sulfate europium metal is available through the electrolysis of a mixture of molten eucl and nacl or cacl in a graphite cell which serves as cathode using graphite as anode the other product is chlorine gas a few large deposits produce or produced a significant amount of the world production the bayan obo iron ore deposit in inner mongolia contains significant amounts of bastn site and monazite and is with an estimated million tonnes of rare earth element oxides the largest known deposit the mining operations at the bayan obo deposit made china the largest supplier of rare earth elements in the s only of the rare earth element content is europium the second large source for rare earth elements between and its closure in the late s was the mountain pass rare earth mine in california the bastn site mined there is especially rich in the light rare earth elements la gd sc and y and contains only of europium another large source for rare earth elements is the loparite found on the kola peninsula it contains besides niobium tantalum and titanium up to rare earth elements and is the largest source for these elements in russia compounds europium compounds tend to exist in a trivalent oxidation state under most conditions commonly these compounds feature eu iii bound by oxygenic ligands typically water these compounds the chlorides sulfates nitrates are soluble in water or polar organic solvent lipophilic europium complexes often feature acetylacetonate like ligands

temperatures sufficiently high to decompose the eu o eu o h s eus h o sthe main nitride of europium is europium iii nitride eun history although europium is present in most of the minerals containing the other rare elements due to the difficulties in separating the elements it was not until the late s that the element was isolated william crookes observed the phosphorescent spectra of the rare elements including those eventually assigned to europium europium was first found in by paul mile lecoq de boisbaudran who obtained basic fractions from samarium gadolinium concentrates which had spectral lines not accounted for by samarium or gadolinium however the discovery of europium is generally credited to french chemist eug ne anatole demar ay who suspected samples of the recently discovered element samarium were contaminated with an unknown element in and who was able to isolate it in he then named it europium when the europium doped yttrium orthovanadate red phosphor was discovered in the early s and understood to be about to cause a revolution in the color television industry there was a scramble for the limited supply of europium on hand among the monazite processors as the typical europium content in monazite is about however the molycorp bastn site deposit at the mountain pass rare earth mine california whose lanthanides had an unusually high europium content of was about to come on line and provide sufficient europium to sustain the industry prior to europium the color tv red phosphor was very weak and the other phosphor colors had to be muted to maintain color balance with the brilliant red europium phosphor it was no longer necessary to mute the other colors and a much brighter color tv picture was the result europium has continued to be in use in the tv industry ever since as well as in computer monitors californian bastn site now faces stiff competition from bayan obo china with an even richer europium content of frank spedding celebrated for his development of the ion exchange technology that revolutionized the rare earth industry in the mid s once related the story of how he was lecturing on the rare earths in the s when an elderly gentleman approached him with an offer of a gift of several pounds of europium oxide this was an unheard of quantity at the time and spedding did not take the man seriously however a package duly arrived in the mail containing several pounds of genuine europium oxide the elderly gentleman had turned out to be herbert newby mccoy who had developed a famous method of europium purification involving redox chemistry applications relative to most other elements commercial applications for europium are few and rather specialized almost invariably its phosphorescence is exploited either in the or oxidation state it is a dopant in some types of glass in lasers and other optoelectronic devices europium oxide eu o is widely used as a red phosphor in television sets and fluorescent lamps and as an activator for yttrium based phosphors color tv screens contain between and g of europium oxide whereas trivalent europium gives red phosphors the luminescence of divalent europium depends strongly on the composition of the host structure uv to deep red luminescence can be achieved the two classes of europium based phosphor red and blue combined with the yellow green terbium phosphors give white light the color temperature of which can be varied by altering the proportion or specific composition of the individual phosphors this phosphor system is typically encountered in helical fluorescent light bulbs combining the same three classes is one way to make trichromatic systems in tv and computer screens but as an additive it can be particularly effective in improving the intensity of red phosphor europium is also used in the manufacture of fluorescent glass increasing the general efficiency of fluorescent lamps one of the more common persistent after glow phosphors besides copper doped zinc sulfide is europium doped strontium aluminate europium fluorescence is used to interrogate biomolecular interactions in drug discovery screens it is also used in the anti counterfeiting phosphors in euro banknotes an application that has almost fallen out of use with the introduction of affordable superconducting magnets is the use of europium complexes such as eu fod as shift reagents in nmr spectroscopy chiral shift reagents such as eu hfc are still used to determine enantiomeric purity a theorized application of europium is its use in stopping thermonuclear threats due to its high neutron capture cross section and neutron poison chain it is preferred for neutron poison based anti thermonuclear missiles precautions there are no clear indications that europium is particularly toxic compared to other heavy metals europium chloride nitrate and oxide have been tested for toxicity europium chloride shows an acute intraperitoneal ld toxicity of mg kg and the acute oral ld toxicity is mg kg europium nitrate shows a slightly higher intraperitoneal ld toxicity of mg kg while the oral toxicity is above mg kg the metal dust presents a fire and explosion hazard ,63
Gadolinium,Gd,gadolinium is a chemical element with the symbol gd and atomic number gadolinium is a silvery white metal when oxidation is removed it is only slightly malleable and is a ductile rare earth element gadolinium reacts with atmospheric oxygen or moisture slowly to form a black coating gadolinium below its curie point of c f is ferromagnetic with an attraction to a magnetic field higher than that of nickel above this temperature it is the most paramagnetic element it is found in nature only in an oxidized form when separated it usually has impurities of the other rare earths because of their similar chemical properties gadolinium was discovered in by jean charles de marignac who detected its oxide by using spectroscopy it is named after the mineral gadolinite one of the minerals in which gadolinium is found itself named for the finnish chemist johan gadolin pure gadolinium was first isolated by the chemist paul mile lecoq de boisbaudran around gadolinium possesses unusual metallurgical properties to the extent that as little as of gadolinium can significantly improve the workability and resistance to oxidation at high temperatures of iron chromium and related metals gadolinium as a metal or a salt absorbs neutrons and is therefore used sometimes for shielding in neutron radiography and in nuclear reactors like most of the rare earths gadolinium forms trivalent ions with fluorescent properties and salts of gadolinium iii are used as phosphors in various applications gadolinium iii ions in water soluble salts are highly toxic to mammals however chelated gadolinium iii compounds prevent the gadolinium iii from being exposed to the organism and the majority is excreted by healthy kidneys before it can deposit in tissues because of its paramagnetic properties solutions of chelated organic gadolinium complexes are used as intravenously administered gadolinium based mri contrast agents in medical magnetic resonance imaging varying amounts deposit in tissues of the brain cardiac muscle kidney other organs and the skin mainly depending on kidney function structure of the chelates linear or macrocyclic and the dose administered characteristics physical properties gadolinium is the eighth member of the lanthanide series in the periodic table it appears between the elements europium to its left and terbium to its right and above the actinide curium it is a silvery white malleable ductile rare earth element its electrons are arranged in the configuration of xe f d s like most other metals in the lanthanide series gadolinium usually uses three electrons as valence electrons as afterward the remaining f electrons are too strongly bound this is because the f orbitals penetrate the most through the inert xenon core of electrons to the nucleus followed by d and s and this increases with higher ionic charge it crystallizes in the hexagonal close packed form at room temperature but when heated to temperatures above c f it transforms into its form which has a body centered cubic structure the isotope gadolinium has the highest thermal neutron capture cross section among any stable nuclide about barns only xenon has a higher capture cross section about million barns but this isotope is radioactive gadolinium is believed to be ferromagnetic at temperatures below c f and is strongly paramagnetic above this temperature there is evidence that gadolinium is a helical antiferromagnetic rather than a ferromagnetic below c f gadolinium demonstrates a magnetocaloric effect whereby its temperature increases when it enters a magnetic field and decreases when it leaves the magnetic field the temperature is lowered to c f for the gadolinium alloy gd er and this effect is considerably stronger for the alloy gd si ge but at a much lower temperature k c f a significant magnetocaloric effect is observed at higher temperatures up to about kelvins in the compounds gd sixge x individual gadolinium atoms can be isolated by encapsulating them into fullerene molecules where they can be visualized with a transmission electron microscope individual gd atoms and small gd clusters can be incorporated into carbon nanotubes chemical properties gadolinium combines with most elements to form gd iii derivatives it also combines with nitrogen carbon sulfur phosphorus boron selenium silicon and arsenic at elevated temperatures forming binary compounds unlike the other rare earth elements metallic gadolinium is relatively stable in dry air however it tarnishes quickly in moist air forming a loosely adhering gadolinium iii oxide gd o gd o gd o which spalls off exposing more surface to oxidation gadolinium is a strong reducing agent which reduces oxides of several metals into their elements gadolinium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form gadolinium hydroxide gd h o gd oh h gadolinium metal is attacked readily by dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the colorless gd iii ions which exist as gd h o complexes gd h so h o gd h o so h gadolinium metal reacts with the halogens x at temperature about c f gd x gdx chemical compounds in the great majority of its compounds like many rare earth metals gadolinium adopts the oxidation state however gadolinium can be found on rare occasions in the and oxidation states all four trihalides are known all are white except for the iodide which is yellow most commonly encountered of the halides is gadolinium iii chloride gdcl the oxide dissolves in acids to give the salts such as gadolinium iii nitrate gadolinium iii like most lanthanide ions forms complexes with high coordination numbers this tendency is illustrated by the use of the chelating agent dota an octadentate ligand salts of gd dota are useful in magnetic resonance imaging a variety of related chelate complexes have been developed including gadodiamide reduced gadolinium compounds are known especially in the solid state gadolinium ii halides are obtained by heating gd iii halides in presence of metallic gd in tantalum containers gadolinium also form sesquichloride gd cl which can be further reduced to gdcl by annealing at c f this gadolinium i chloride forms platelets with layered graphite like structure isotopes naturally occurring gadolinium is composed of six stable isotopes gd gd gd gd gd and gd and one radioisotope gd with the isotope gd being the most abundant natural abundance the predicted double beta decay of gd has never been observed an experimental lower limit on its half life of more than years has been measured thirty three radioisotopes of gadolinium have been observed with the most stable being gd naturally occurring with a half life of about years and gd with a half life of years all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives of less than years the majority of these have half lives of less than seconds gadolinium isotopes have four metastable isomers with the most stable being mgd t seconds mgd t seconds and mgd t seconds the isotopes with atomic masses lower than the most abundant stable isotope gd primarily decay by electron capture to isotopes of europium at higher atomic masses the primary decay mode is beta decay and the primary products are isotopes of terbium history gadolinium is named after the mineral gadolinite in turn named after finnish chemist and geologist johan gadolin in the swiss chemist jean charles galissard de marignac observed the spectroscopic lines from gadolinium in samples of gadolinite which actually contains relatively little gadolinium but enough to show a spectrum and in the separate mineral cerite the latter mineral proved to contain far more of the element with the new spectral line de marignac eventually separated a mineral oxide from cerite which he realized was the oxide of this new element he named the oxide gadolinia because he realized that gadolinia was the oxide of a new element he is credited with the discovery of gadolinium the french chemist paul mile lecoq de boisbaudran carried out the separation of gadolinium metal from gadolinia in occurrence gadolinium is a constituent in many minerals such as monazite and bastn site the metal is too reactive to exist naturally paradoxically as noted above the mineral gadolinite actually contains only traces of this element the abundance in the earth s crust is about mg kg the main mining areas are in china the us brazil sri lanka india and australia with reserves expected to exceed one million tonnes world production of pure gadolinium is about tonnes per year the only known mineral with essential gadolinium lepersonnite gd is very rare production gadolinium is produced both from monazite and bastn site crushed minerals are extracted with hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid which converts the insoluble oxides into soluble chlorides or sulfates the acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with caustic soda to ph thorium precipitates as its hydroxide and is then removed the remaining solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates the oxalates are converted to oxides by heating the oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of the main components cerium whose oxide is insoluble in hno the solution is treated with magnesium nitrate to produce a crystallized mixture of double salts of gadolinium samarium and europium the salts are separated by ion exchange chromatography the rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by a suitable complexing agent gadolinium metal is obtained from its oxide or salts by heating it with calcium at c f in an argon atmosphere sponge gadolinium can be produced by reducing molten gdcl with an appropriate metal at temperatures below c f the melting point of gd at reduced pressure applications gadolinium has no large scale applications but it has a variety of specialized uses because gd has a high neutron cross section it is used to target tumors in neutron therapy this element is effective for use with neutron radiography and in shielding of nuclear reactors it is used as a secondary emergency shut down measure in some nuclear reactors particularly of the candu reactor type gadolinium is also used in nuclear marine propulsion systems as a burnable poison gadolinium possesses unusual metallurgic properties with as little as of gadolinium improving the workability and resistance of iron chromium and related alloys to high temperatures and oxidation gadolinium is paramagnetic at room temperature with a ferromagnetic curie point of c f paramagnetic ions such as gadolinium enhance nuclear relaxation rates making gadolinium useful for magnetic resonance imaging mri solutions of organic gadolinium complexes and gadolinium compounds are used as intravenous mri contrast agent to enhance images in medical magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography mra procedures magnevist is the most widespread example nanotubes packed with gadolinium called gadonanotubes are times more effective than the usual gadolinium contrast agent traditional gadolinium based contrast agents are un targeted generally distributing throughout the body after injection but will not cross the intact blood brain barrier brain tumors and other disorders that degrade the blood brain barrier allow these agents to penetrate into the brain and facilitate their detection by contrast enhanced mri similarly delayed gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage uses an ionic compound agent originally magnevist that is excluded from healthy cartilage based on electrostatic repulsion but will enter proteoglycan depleted cartilage in diseases such as osteoarthritis gadolinium as a phosphor is also used in other imaging in x ray systems gadolinium is contained in the phosphor layer suspended in a polymer matrix at the detector terbium doped gadolinium oxysulfide gd o s tb at the phosphor layer converts the x rays released from the source into light this material emits green light at nm due to the presence of tb which is very useful for enhancing the imaging quality the energy conversion of gd is up to which means that of the x ray energy striking the phosphor layer can be converted into visible photons gadolinium oxyorthosilicate gd sio gso usually doped by of ce is a single crystal that is used as a scintillator in medical imaging such as positron emission tomography or for detecting neutrons gadolinium compounds are also used for making green phosphors for color tv tubes gadolinium is produced in a nuclear reactor from elemental europium or enriched gadolinium targets it has a half life of days and emits gamma radiation with strong peaks at kev and kev it is used in many quality assurance applications such as line sources and calibration phantoms to ensure that nuclear medicine imaging systems operate correctly and produce useful images of radioisotope distribution inside the patient it is also used as a gamma ray source in x ray absorption measurements or in bone density gauges for osteoporosis screening as well as in the lixiscope portable x ray imaging system gadolinium is used for making gadolinium yttrium garnet gd y al o it has microwave applications and is used in fabrication of various optical components and as substrate material for magneto optical films gadolinium gallium garnet ggg gd ga o was used for imitation diamonds and for computer bubble memory gadolinium can also serve as an electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells sofcs using gadolinium as a dopant for materials like cerium oxide in the form of gadolinium doped ceria creates an electrolyte with both high ionic conductivity and low operating temperatures which are optimal for cost effective production of fuel cells research is being conducted on magnetic refrigeration near room temperature which could provide significant efficiency and environmental advantages over conventional refrigeration methods gadolinium based materials such as gd sixge x are currently the most promising materials owing to their high curie temperature and giant magnetocaloric effect pure gd itself exhibits a large magnetocaloric effect near its curie temperature of c f and this has sparked great interest into producing gd alloys with a larger effect and tunable curie temperature in gd sixge x si and ge compositions can be varied to adjust the curie temperature this technology is still very early in development and significant material improvements still need to be made before it is commercially viable physicists mark vagins and john beacom of the japanese super kamiokande theorized that gadolinium may facilitate neutrino detection when it is added to very high purity water in the tank gadolinium barium copper oxide gdbco has been researched for its superconducting properties with applications in superconducting motors or generators for example in a wind turbine it can be manufactured in the same way as the most widely researched cuprate high temperature superconductor yttrium barium copper oxide ybco and uses an analogous chemical composition gdba cu o most notably it was used by the bulk superconductivity group from the university of cambridge in to set a new world record for the highest trapped magnetic field in a bulk high temperature superconductor with a field of t being trapped within two gdbco bulks safety as a free ion gadolinium is reported often to be highly toxic but mri contrast agents are chelated compounds and are considered safe enough to be used in most persons the toxicity of free gadolinium ions in animals is due to interference with a number of calcium ion channel dependent processes the lethal dose is about mmol kg iv mouse or mg kg toxicity studies in rodents show that chelation of gadolinium which also improves its solubility decreases its toxicity with regard to the free ion by a factor of i e the lethal dose for the gd chelate increases by times it is believed therefore that clinical toxicity of gadolinium based contrast agents gbcas in humans will depend on the strength of the chelating agent however this research is still not complete about a dozen different gd chelated agents have been approved as mri contrast agents around the world in patients with kidney failure there is a risk of a rare but serious illness called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis nsf that is caused by the use of gadolinium based contrast agents the disease resembles scleromyxedema and to some extent scleroderma it may occur months after a contrast agent has been injected its association with gadolinium and not the carrier molecule is confirmed by its occurrence with various contrast materials in which gadolinium is carried by very different carrier molecules due to this it is not recommended to use these agents for any individual with end stage kidney failure as they will require emergent dialysis similar but not identical symptoms to nsf may occur in subjects with normal or near normal renal function within hours to months following the administration of gbcas the name gadolinium deposition disease gdd has been proposed for this condition which occurs in the absence of pre existent disease or subsequently developed disease of an alternate known process a study reported numerous anecdotal cases of gdd however in that study participants were recruited from online support groups for subjects self identified as having gadolinium toxicity and no relevant medical history or data were collected there have yet to be definitive scientific studies proving the existence of the condition included in the current guidelines from the canadian association of radiologists are that dialysis patients should only receive gadolinium agents where essential and that they should receive dialysis after the exam if a contrast enhanced mri must be performed on a dialysis patient it is recommended that certain high risk contrast agents be avoided but not that a lower dose be considered the american college of radiology recommends that contrast enhanced mri examinations be performed as closely before dialysis as possible as a precautionary measure although this has not been proven to reduce the likelihood of developing nsf the fda recommends that potential for gadolinium retention be considered when choosing the type of gbca used in patients requiring multiple lifetime doses pregnant women children and patients with inflammatory conditions anaphylactoid reactions are rare occurring in approximately long term environmental impacts of gadolinium contamination due to human usage is a topic of ongoing research biological role gadolinium has no known native biological role but its compounds are used as research tools in biomedicine gd compounds are components of mri contrast agents it is used in various ion channel electrophysiology experiments to block sodium leak channels and stretch activated ion channels gadolinium has recently been used to measure the distance between two points in a protein via electron paramagnetic resonance something that gadolinium is especially amenable to thanks to epr sensitivity at w band ghz frequencies ,64
Terbium,Tb,terbium is a chemical element with the symbol tb and atomic number it is a silvery white rare earth metal that is malleable and ductile the ninth member of the lanthanide series terbium is a fairly electropositive metal that reacts with water evolving hydrogen gas terbium is never found in nature as a free element but it is contained in many minerals including cerite gadolinite monazite xenotime and euxenite swedish chemist carl gustaf mosander discovered terbium as a chemical element in he detected it as an impurity in yttrium oxide y o yttrium and terbium as well as erbium and ytterbium are named after the village of ytterby in sweden terbium was not isolated in pure form until the advent of ion exchange techniques terbium is used to dope calcium fluoride calcium tungstate

exposed to magnetic fields more than any other alloy terbium is of use in actuators in naval sonar systems and in sensors most of the world s terbium supply is used in green phosphors terbium oxide is in fluorescent lamps and television and monitor cathode ray tubes crts terbium green phosphors are combined with divalent europium blue phosphors and trivalent europium red phosphors to provide trichromatic lighting technology a high efficiency white light used for standard illumination in indoor lighting characteristics physical properties terbium is a silvery white rare earth metal that is malleable ductile and soft enough to be cut with a knife it is relatively stable in air compared to the earlier more reactive lanthanides in the first half of the lanthanide series terbium exists in two crystal allotropes with a transformation temperature of c between them the electrons of a terbium atom are arranged in the electron configuration xe f s normally only three electrons can be removed before the nuclear charge becomes too great to allow further ionization but in the case of terbium the stability of the half filled xe f configuration allows further ionization of a fourth electron in the presence of very strong oxidizing agents such as fluorine gas the terbium iii cation is brilliantly fluorescent in a bright lemon yellow color that is the result of a strong green emission line in combination with other lines in the orange and red the yttrofluorite variety of the mineral fluorite owes its creamy yellow fluorescence in part to terbium terbium easily oxidizes and is therefore used in its elemental form specifically for research single terbium atoms have been isolated by implanting them into fullerene molecules terbium has a simple ferromagnetic ordering at temperatures below k above k it turns into a helical antiferromagnetic state in which all of the atomic moments in a particular basal plane layer are parallel and oriented at a fixed angle to the moments of adjacent layers this unusual antiferromagnetism transforms into a disordered paramagnetic state at k chemical properties terbium metal is an electropositive element and oxidizes in the presence of most acids such as sulfuric acid all of the halogens and even water tb s h so tb so h tb x tbx x f cl br i tb s h o tb oh h terbium also oxidizes readily in air to form a mixed terbium iii iv oxide tb o tb o the most common oxidation state of terbium is trivalent such as tbcl in the solid state tetravalent terbium is also known in compounds such as tbo and tbf in solution terbium typically forms trivalent species but can be oxidized to the tetravalent state with ozone in highly basic aqueous conditions the coordination and organometallic chemistry of terbium is similar to other lanthanides in aqueous conditions terbium can be coordinated by nine water molecules which are arranged in a tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry complexes of terbium with lower coordination number are also known typically with bulky ligands like bis trimethyl silylamide which forms the three coordinate tb n sime complex most coordination and organometallic complexes contain terbium in the trivalent oxidation state divalent tb complexes are also known usually with bulky cyclopentadienyl type ligands a few coordination compounds containing terbium in its tetravalent state are also known oxidation states like most rare earth elements and lanthanides terbium is usually found in the oxidation state like cerium and praseodymium terbium can also form a oxidation state although it is unstable in water however it is possible for terbium to also be found in the and oxidation states compounds terbium combines with nitrogen carbon sulfur phosphorus boron selenium silicon and arsenic at elevated temperatures forming various binary compounds such as tbh tbh tbb tb s tbse tbte and tbn in those compounds tb mostly exhibits the oxidation states and sometimes terbium ii halides are obtained by annealing tb iii halides in presence of metallic tb in tantalum containers terbium also forms sesquichloride tb cl which can be further reduced to tbcl by annealing at c this terbium i chloride forms platelets with layered graphite like structure terbium iv fluoride is the only halide that tetravalent terbium can form and has strong oxidizing properties it is also a strong fluorinating agent emitting relatively pure atomic fluorine when heated rather than the mixture of fluoride vapors emitted from cobalt iii fluoride or cerium iv fluoride it can be obtained by reacting terbium iii chloride or terbium iii fluoride with fluorine gas at c tbf f tbf when tbf and csf is mixed in a stoichiometric ratio in a fluorine gas atmosphere cstbf is obtained it is an orthorhombic crystal with space group cmca with a layered structure composed of tbf and coordinated cs the compound batbf can be prepared in a similar method it is an orthorhombic crystal with space group cmma the compound tbf also exists other compounds include chlorides tbcl bromides tbbr iodides tbi fluorides tbf tbf isotopes naturally occurring terbium is composed of its only stable isotope terbium the element is thus mononuclidic and monoisotopic thirty six radioisotopes have been characterized with the heaviest being terbium with an atomic mass of u and lightest being terbium exact mass unknown the most stable synthetic radioisotopes of terbium are terbium with a half life of years and terbium with a half life of years all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are much less than a quarter of a year and the majority of these have half lives that are less than half a minute the primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope tb is electron capture which results in production of gadolinium isotopes and the primary mode after is beta minus decay resulting in dysprosium isotopes the element also has nuclear isomers with masses of and not every mass number corresponds to only one isomer the most stable of them are terbium m with a half life of hours and terbium m with a half life of hours this is longer than half lives of most ground states of radioactive terbium isotopes except those with mass numbers history swedish chemist carl gustaf mosander discovered terbium in he detected it as an impurity in yttrium oxide y o yttrium is named after the village of ytterby in sweden terbium was not isolated in pure form until the advent of ion exchange techniques mosander first separated yttria into three fractions all named for the ore yttria erbia and terbia terbia was originally the fraction that contained the pink color due to the element now known as erbium erbia containing what is now known as terbium originally was the fraction that was essentially colorless in solution the insoluble oxide of this element was noted to be tinged brown later workers had difficulty in observing the minor colorless erbia but the soluble pink fraction was impossible to miss arguments went back and forth as to whether erbia even existed in the confusion the original names got reversed and the exchange of names stuck so that the pink fraction referred eventually to the solution containing erbium which in solution is pink it is now thought that workers using double sodium or potassium sulfates to remove ceria from yttria inadvertently lost the terbium into the ceria containing precipitate what is now known as terbium was only about of the original yttria but that was sufficient to impart a yellowish color to the yttrium oxide thus terbium was a minor component in the original fraction containing it where it was dominated by its immediate neighbors gadolinium and dysprosium thereafter whenever other rare earths were teased apart from this mixture whichever fraction gave the brown oxide retained the terbium name until at last the brown oxide of terbium was obtained in pure form the th century investigators did not have the benefit of the uv fluorescence technology to observe the brilliant yellow or green tb iii fluorescence that would have made terbium easier to identify in solid mixtures or solutions occurrence terbium is contained along with other rare earth elements in many minerals including monazite ce la th nd y po with up to terbium xenotime ypo and euxenite y ca er la ce u th nb ta ti o with or more terbium the crust abundance of terbium is estimated as mg kg no terbium dominant mineral has yet been found currently the richest commercial sources of terbium are the ion adsorption clays of southern china the concentrates with about two thirds yttrium oxide by weight have about terbia small amounts of terbium occur in bastn site and monazite when these are processed by solvent extraction to recover the valuable heavy lanthanides as samarium europium gadolinium concentrate terbium is recovered therein due to the large volumes of bastn site processed relative to the ion adsorption clays a significant proportion of the world s terbium supply comes from bastn site in a rich terbium supply was discovered off the coast of japan s minamitori island with the stated supply being enough to meet the global demand for years production crushed terbium containing minerals are treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water soluble sulfates of rare earths the acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with caustic soda to ph thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed after that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates the oxalates are decomposed to oxides by heating the oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of the main components cerium whose oxide is insoluble in hno terbium is separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization the most efficient separation routine for terbium salt from the rare earth salt solution is ion exchange in this process rare earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin the rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agents as with other rare earths terbium metal is produced by reducing the anhydrous chloride or fluoride with calcium metal calcium and tantalum impurities can be removed by vacuum remelting distillation amalgam formation or zone melting applications terbium is used as a dopant in calcium fluoride calcium tungstate and strontium molybdate materials that are used in solid state devices and as a crystal stabilizer of fuel cells which operate at elevated temperatures together with zro terbium is also used in alloys and in the production of electronic devices as a component of terfenol d terbium is used in actuators in naval sonar systems sensors in the soundbug device its first commercial application and other magnetomechanical devices terfenol d is a terbium alloy that expands or contracts in the presence of a magnetic field it has the highest magnetostriction of any alloy terbium oxide is used in green phosphors in fluorescent lamps and color tv tubes sodium terbium borate is used in solid state devices the brilliant fluorescence allows terbium to be used as a probe in biochemistry where it somewhat resembles calcium in its behavior terbium green phosphors which fluoresce a brilliant lemon yellow are combined with divalent europium blue phosphors and trivalent europium red phosphors to provide the trichromatic lighting technology which is by far the largest consumer of the world s terbium supply trichromatic lighting provides much higher light output for a given amount of electrical energy than does incandescent lighting terbium is also used to detect endospores as it acts as an assay of dipicolinic acid based on photoluminescence precautions as with the other lanthanides terbium compounds are of low to moderate toxicity although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail terbium has no known biological role ,65
Dysprosium,Dy,dysprosium is the chemical element with the symbol dy and atomic number it is a rare earth element in the lanthanide series with a metallic silver luster dysprosium is never found in nature as a free element though like other lanthanides it is found in various minerals such as xenotime naturally occurring dysprosium is composed of seven isotopes the most abundant of which is dy dysprosium was first identified in by paul mile lecoq de boisbaudran but it was not isolated in pure form until the development of ion exchange techniques in the s dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements it is used for its high thermal neutron absorption cross section in making control rods in nuclear reactors for its high magnetic susceptibility v in data storage applications and as a component of terfenol d a magnetostrictive material soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic while the insoluble salts are considered non toxic characteristics physical properties dysprosium is a rare earth element and has a metallic bright silver luster it is quite soft and can be machined without sparking if overheating is avoided dysprosium s physical characteristics can be greatly affected by even small amounts of impurities dysprosium and holmium have the highest magnetic strengths of the elements especially at low temperatures dysprosium has a simple ferromagnetic ordering at temperatures below k c above k c it turns into a helical antiferromagnetic state in which all of the atomic moments in a particular basal plane layer are parallel and oriented at a fixed angle to the moments of adjacent layers this unusual antiferromagnetism transforms into a disordered paramagnetic state at k c chemical properties dysprosium metal retains its luster in dry air however it will tarnish slowly in moist air and burns readily to form dysprosium iii oxide dy o dy o dysprosium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form dysprosium hydroxide dy s h o l dy oh aq h g dysprosium hydroxide decomposes to form dyo oh at elevated temperatures which then decomposes again to dysprosium iii oxide dysprosium metal vigorously reacts with all the halogens at above c dy s f g dyf s green dy s cl g dycl s white dy s br l dybr s white dy s i g dyi s green dysprosium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the yellow dy iii ions which exist as a dy oh complex dy s h so aq dy aq so aq h g the resulting compound dysprosium iii sulfate is noticeably paramagnetic compounds dysprosium halides such as dyf and dybr tend to take on a yellow color dysprosium oxide also known as dysprosia is a white powder that is highly magnetic more so than iron oxide dysprosium combines with various non metals at high temperatures to form binary compounds with varying composition and oxidation states and sometimes such as dyn dyp dyh and dyh dys dys dy s and dy s dyb dyb dyb and dyb as well as dy c and dy c dysprosium carbonate dy co and dysprosium sulfate dy so result from similar reactions most dysprosium compounds are soluble in water though dysprosium carbonate tetrahydrate dy co h o and dysprosium oxalate decahydrate dy c o h o are both insoluble in water two of the most abundant dysprosium carbonates dy co h o similar to the mineral tengerite y and dyco oh similar to minerals kozoite la and kozoite nd are known to form via a poorly ordered amorphous precursor phase with a formula of dy co h o this amorphous precursor consists of highly hydrated spherical nanoparticles of nm diameter that are exceptionally stable under dry treatment at ambient and high temperatures isotopes naturally occurring dysprosium is composed of seven isotopes dy dy dy dy dy dy and dy these are all considered stable although dy can theoretically undergo alpha decay with a half life of over years dysprosium is the heaviest element with isotopes that are not observationally stable or radioactive the naturally occurring isotopes dy is the most abundant at followed by dy at the least abundant is dy at twenty nine radioisotopes have also been synthesized ranging in atomic mass from to the most stable of these is dy with a half life of approximately years followed by dy with a half life of days the least stable is dy with a half life of ms as a general rule isotopes that are lighter than the stable isotopes tend to decay primarily by decay while those that are heavier tend to decay by decay however dy decays primarily by alpha decay and dy and dy decay primarily by electron capture dysprosium also has at least metastable isomers ranging in atomic mass from to the most stable of these is mdy which has a half life of minutes dy has two metastable isomers the second of which m dy has a half life of ns history in erbium ores were found to contain the oxides of holmium and thulium french chemist paul mile lecoq de boisbaudran while working with holmium oxide separated dysprosium oxide from it in paris in his procedure for isolating the dysprosium involved dissolving dysprosium oxide in acid then adding ammonia to precipitate the hydroxide he was only able to isolate dysprosium from its oxide after more than attempts at his procedure on succeeding he named the element dysprosium from the greek dysprositos meaning hard to get the element was not isolated in relatively pure form until after the development of ion exchange techniques by frank spedding at iowa state university in the early s due to its role in permanent magnets used for wind turbines it has been argued that dysprosium will be one of the main objects of geopolitical competition in a world running on renewable energy but this perspective has been criticised for failing to recognise that most wind turbines do not use permanent magnets and for underestimating the power of economic incentives for expanded production in dy was turned into a dimensional supersolid quantum gas occurrence while dysprosium is never encountered as a free element it is found in many minerals including xenotime fergusonite gadolinite euxenite polycrase blomstrandine monazite and bastn site often with erbium and holmium or other rare earth elements no dysprosium dominant mineral that is with dysprosium prevailing over other rare earths in the composition has yet been found in the high yttrium version of these dysprosium happens to be the most abundant of the heavy lanthanides comprising up to of the concentrate as compared to about for yttrium the concentration of dy in the earth s crust is about mg kg and in sea water ng l production dysprosium is obtained primarily from monazite sand a mixture of various phosphates the metal is obtained as a by product in the commercial extraction of yttrium in isolating dysprosium most of the unwanted metals can be removed magnetically or by a flotation process dysprosium can then be separated from other rare earth metals by an ion exchange displacement process the resulting dysprosium ions can then react with either fluorine or chlorine to form dysprosium fluoride dyf or dysprosium chloride dycl these compounds can be reduced using either calcium or lithium metals in the following reactions ca dyf dy caf li dycl dy liclthe components are placed in a tantalum crucible and fired in a helium atmosphere as the reaction progresses the resulting halide compounds and molten dysprosium separate due to differences in density when the mixture cools the dysprosium can be cut away from the impurities about tonnes of dysprosium are produced worldwide each year with of that total produced in china dysprosium prices have climbed nearly twentyfold from per pound in to a pound in late the price increased to kg in but fell to in largely due to illegal production in china which circumvented government restrictions currently most dysprosium is being obtained from the ion adsorption clay ores of southern china as of november the browns range project pilot plant km south east of halls creek western australia is producing tonnes long tons per annum according to the united states department of energy the wide range of its current and projected uses together with the lack of any immediately suitable replacement makes dysprosium the single most critical element for emerging clean energy technologies even their most conservative projections predicted a shortfall of dysprosium before as of late there is a nascent rare earth including dysprosium extraction industry in australia applications dysprosium is used in conjunction with vanadium and other elements in making laser materials and commercial lighting because of dysprosium s high thermal neutron absorption cross section dysprosium oxide nickel cermets are used in neutron absorbing control rods in nuclear reactors dysprosium cadmium chalcogenides are sources of infrared radiation which is useful for studying chemical reactions because dysprosium and its compounds are highly susceptible to magnetization they are employed in various data storage applications such as in hard disks dysprosium is increasingly in demand for the permanent magnets used in electric car motors and wind turbine generators neodymium iron boron magnets can have up to of the neodymium substituted by dysprosium to raise the coercivity for demanding applications such as drive motors for electric vehicles and generators for wind turbines this substitution would require up to grams of dysprosium per electric car produced based on toyota s projected million units per year the use of dysprosium in applications such as this would quickly exhaust its available supply the dysprosium substitution may also be useful in other applications because it improves the corrosion resistance of the magnets dysprosium is one of the components of terfenol d along with iron and terbium terfenol d has the highest room temperature magnetostriction of any known material which is employed in transducers wide band mechanical resonators and high precision liquid fuel injectors dysprosium is used in dosimeters for measuring ionizing radiation crystals of calcium sulfate or calcium fluoride are doped with dysprosium when these crystals are exposed to radiation the dysprosium atoms become excited and luminescent the luminescence can be measured to determine the degree of exposure to which the dosimeter has been subjected nanofibers of dysprosium compounds have high strength and a large surface area therefore they can be used to reinforce other materials and act as a catalyst fibers of dysprosium oxide fluoride can be produced by heating an aqueous solution of dybr and naf to c at bars for hours this material is remarkably robust surviving over hours in various aqueous solutions at temperatures exceeding c without redissolving or aggregating additionally dysprosium has been used to create a two dimensional supersolid in a laboratory environment supersolids are expected to exhibit unusual properties including superfluidity dysprosium iodide and dysprosium bromide are used in high intensity metal halide lamps these compounds dissociate near the hot center of the lamp releasing isolated dysprosium atoms the latter re emit light in the green and red part of the spectrum thereby effectively producing bright light several paramagnetic crystal salts of dysprosium dysprosium gallium garnet dgg dysprosium aluminum garnet dag dysprosium iron garnet dyig are used in adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators the trivalent dysprosium ion dy has been studied due its downshifting luminescence properties dy doped yttrium aluminium garnet dy yag excited in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum results in the emission of photons of longer wavelength in the visible region this idea is the basis for a new generation of uv pumped white light emitting diodes precautions like many powders dysprosium powder may present an explosion hazard when mixed with air and when an ignition source is present thin foils of the substance can also be ignited by sparks or by static electricity dysprosium fires cannot be extinguished with water it can react with water to produce flammable hydrogen gas dysprosium chloride fires can be extinguished with water dysprosium fluoride and dysprosium oxide are non flammable dysprosium nitrate dy no is a strong oxidizing agent and readily ignites on contact with organic substances soluble dysprosium salts such as dysprosium chloride and dysprosium nitrate are mildly toxic when ingested based on the toxicity of dysprosium chloride to mice it is estimated that the ingestion of grams or more could be fatal to a human c f lethal dose of grams of common table salt for a kilogram human the insoluble salts are non toxic ,66
Holmium,Ho,holmium is a chemical element with the symbol ho and atomic number it is a rare earth element and the eleventh member of the lanthanide series it is a relatively soft silvery fairly corrosion resistant and malleable metal like a lot of other lanthanides holmium is too reactive to be found in native form as pure holmium slowly forms a yellowish oxide coating when exposed to air when isolated holmium is relatively stable in dry air at room temperature however it reacts with water and corrodes readily and also burns in air when heated in nature holmium occurs together with the other rare earth metals like thulium it is a relatively rare lanthanide making up parts per million of the earth s crust an abundance similar to tungsten holmium was discovered through isolation by swedish chemist per theodor cleve and independently by jacques louis soret and marc delafontaine who observed it spectroscopically in its oxide was first isolated from rare earth ores by cleve in the element s name comes from holmia the latin name for the city of stockholm like many other lanthanides holmium is found in the minerals monazite and gadolinite and is usually commercially extracted from monazite using ion exchange techniques its compounds in nature and in nearly all of its laboratory chemistry are trivalently oxidized containing ho iii ions trivalent holmium ions have fluorescent properties similar to many other rare earth ions while yielding their own set of unique emission light lines and thus are used in the same way as some other rare earths in certain laser and glass colorant applications holmium has the highest magnetic permeability and magnetic saturation of any element and is thus used for the polepieces of the strongest static magnets because holmium strongly absorbs neutrons it is also used as a burnable poison in nuclear reactors characteristics physical properties holmium is the eleventh member of the lanthanide series in the periodic table it appears between the lanthanides dysprosium to its left and erbium to its right and above the actinide einsteinium it is a relatively soft and malleable element that is fairly corrosion resistant and stable in dry air at standard temperature and pressure in moist air and at higher temperatures however it quickly oxidizes forming a yellowish oxide in pure form holmium possesses a metallic bright silvery luster with a boiling point of c holmium is the sixth most volatile lanthanide after ytterbium europium samarium thulium and dysprosium at ambient conditions holmium like many of the second half of the lanthanides normally assumes a hexagonally close packed hcp structure its electrons are arranged in the configuration xe f s holmium oxide has some fairly dramatic color changes depending on the lighting conditions in daylight it has a tannish yellow color under trichromatic light it is fiery orange red almost indistinguishable from the appearance of erbium oxide under the same lighting conditions the perceived color change is related to the sharp absorption bands of holmium interacting with a subset of the sharp emission bands of the trivalent ions of europium and terbium acting as phosphors holmium like all of the lanthanides except lanthanum ytterbium and lutetium which have no unpaired f electrons is paramagnetic in ambient conditions but is ferromagnetic at temperatures below k it has the highest magnetic moment b of any naturally occurring element and possesses other unusual magnetic properties when combined with yttrium it forms highly magnetic compounds isotopes natural holmium consists of one stable isotope holmium synthetic radioactive isotopes are known the most stable one is holmium with a half life of years all other radioisotopes have ground state half lives not greater than days with the longest ho having a half life of hours and most have half lives under hours however the metastable m ho has a half life of around years because of its high spin this fact combined with a high excitation energy resulting in a particularly rich spectrum of decay gamma rays produced when the metastable state de excites makes this isotope useful in nuclear physics experiments as a means for calibrating energy responses and intrinsic efficiencies of gamma ray spectrometers chemical properties holmium metal tarnishes slowly in air forming a yellowish oxide layer like iron rust it burns readily to form holmium iii oxide ho o ho o holmium is quite electropositive and is generally trivalent it reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly

molecules of water holmium dissolves in acids however holmium is found to also exist in the and oxidation states organoholmium compounds organoholmium compounds are very similar to those of the other lanthanides as they all share an inability to undergo backbonding they are thus mostly restricted to the mostly ionic cyclopentadienides isostructural with those of lanthanum and the bonded simple alkyls and aryls some of which may be polymeric history holmium holmia latin name for stockholm was discovered by jacques louis soret and marc delafontaine in who noticed the aberrant spectrographic absorption bands of the then unknown element they called it element x as well per teodor cleve independently discovered the element while he was working on erbia earth erbium oxide and was the first to isolate it using the method developed by carl gustaf mosander cleve first removed all of the known contaminants from erbia the result of that effort was two new materials one brown and one green he named the brown substance holmia after the latin name for cleve s home town stockholm and the green one thulia holmia was later found to be the holmium oxide and thulia was thulium oxide in henry moseley s classic paper on atomic numbers holmium was assigned an atomic number of evidently the holmium preparation he had been given to investigate had been grossly impure dominated by neighboring and unplotted dysprosium he would have seen x ray emission lines for both elements but assumed that the dominant ones belonged to holmium instead of the dysprosium impurity occurrence and production like all other rare earths holmium is not naturally found as a free element it does occur combined with other elements in gadolinite the black part of the specimen illustrated to the right monazite and other rare earth minerals no holmium dominant mineral has yet been found the main mining areas are china united states brazil india sri lanka and australia with reserves of holmium estimated as tonnes holmium makes up parts per million of the earth s crust by mass this makes it the th most abundant element in the earth s crust holmium makes up part per million of the soils parts per quadrillion of seawater and almost none of earth s atmosphere which is very rare for a lanthanide it makes up parts per trillion of the universe by mass it is commercially extracted by ion exchange from monazite sand holmium but is still difficult to separate from other rare earths the element has been isolated through the reduction of its anhydrous chloride or fluoride with metallic calcium its estimated abundance in the earth s crust is mg kg holmium obeys the oddo harkins rule as an odd numbered element it is less abundant than its immediate even numbered neighbors dysprosium and erbium however it is the most abundant of the odd numbered heavy lanthanides of the lanthanides only promethium thulium lutetium and terbium are less abundant on earth the principal current source are some of the ion adsorption clays of southern china some of these have a rare earth composition similar to that found in xenotime or gadolinite yttrium makes up about of the total by mass holmium is around the original ores themselves are very lean maybe only total lanthanide but are easily extracted holmium is relatively inexpensive for a rare earth metal with the price about usd kg applications holmium has the highest magnetic strength of any element and therefore is used to create the strongest artificially generated magnetic fields when placed within high strength magnets as a magnetic pole piece also called a magnetic flux concentrator it is also used in the manufacture of some permanent magnets since it can absorb nuclear fission bred neutrons it is also used as a burnable poison to regulate nuclear reactors holmium doped yttrium iron garnet yig and yttrium lithium fluoride ylf have applications in solid state lasers and ho yig has applications in optical isolators and in microwave equipment e g yig spheres holmium lasers emit at micrometres they are used in medical dental and fiber optical applications holmium is one of the colorants used for cubic zirconia and glass providing yellow or red coloring glass containing holmium oxide and holmium oxide solutions usually in perchloric acid has sharp optical absorption peaks in the spectral range nm they are therefore used as a calibration standard for optical spectrophotometers and are available commercially the radioactive but long lived m ho see isotopes above is used in calibration of gamma ray spectrometers in march ibm announced that they had developed a technique to store one bit of data on a single holmium atom set on a bed of magnesium oxide with sufficient quantum and classical control techniques ho could be a good candidate to make quantum computers biological role holmium plays no biological role in humans but its salts are able to stimulate metabolism humans typically consume about a milligram of holmium a year plants do not readily take up holmium from the soil some vegetables have had their holmium content measured and it amounted to parts per trillion toxicity large amounts of holmium salts can cause severe damage if inhaled consumed orally or injected the biological effects of holmium over a long period of time are not known holmium has a low level of acute toxicity prices the price of kilogram of holmium oxide fob china in rmb kg is given by the institute of rare earths elements and strategic metals as below usd until march it then rose steeply to just below usd by july

ions which have optical fluorescent properties particularly useful in certain laser applications erbium doped glasses or crystals can be used as optical amplification media where er ions are optically pumped at around or nm and then radiate light at nm in stimulated emission this process results in an unusually mechanically simple laser optical amplifier for signals transmitted by fiber optics the nm wavelength is especially important for optical communications because standard single mode optical fibers have minimal loss at this particular wavelength in addition to optical fiber amplifier lasers a large variety of medical applications i e dermatology dentistry rely on the erbium ion s nm emission see er yag laser when lit at another wavelength which is highly absorbed in water in

for ytterby a village in sweden was discovered by carl gustaf mosander in mosander was working with a sample of what was thought to be the single metal oxide yttria derived from the mineral gadolinite he discovered that the sample contained at least two metal oxides in addition to pure yttria which he named erbia and terbia after the village of ytterby where the gadolinite had been found mosander was not certain of the purity of the oxides and later tests confirmed his uncertainty not only did the yttria contain yttrium erbium and terbium in the ensuing years chemists geologists and spectroscopists discovered five additional elements ytterbium scandium thulium holmium and gadolinium erbia and terbia however were confused at this time a spectroscopist mistakenly switched the names of the two elements during spectroscopy after terbia was renamed erbia and after what had been known as erbia was renamed terbia fairly pure er o was independently isolated in by georges urbain and charles james reasonably pure erbium metal was not produced until when wilhelm klemm and heinrich bommer reduced the anhydrous chloride with potassium vapor it was only in the s that the price for chinese derived erbium oxide became low enough for erbium to be considered for use as a colorant in art glass occurrence the concentration of erbium in the earth crust is about mg kg and in seawater ng l erbium is the th most abundant element in the earth s crust at about ppm like other rare earths this element is never found as a free element in nature but is found bound in monazite sand ores it has historically been very difficult and expensive to separate rare earths from each other in their ores but ion exchange chromatography methods developed in the late th century have greatly brought down the cost of production of all rare earth metals and their chemical compounds the principal commercial sources of erbium are from the minerals xenotime and euxenite and most recently the ion adsorption clays of southern china in consequence china has now become the principal global supplier of this element in the high yttrium versions of these ore concentrates yttrium is about two thirds of the total by weight and erbia is about when the concentrate is dissolved in acid the erbia liberates enough erbium ion to impart a distinct and characteristic pink color to the solution this color behavior is similar to what mosander and the other early workers in the lanthanides would have seen in their extracts from the gadolinite minerals of ytterby production crushed minerals are attacked by hydrochloric or sulfuric acid that transforms insoluble rare earth oxides into soluble chlorides or sulfates the acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with caustic soda sodium hydroxide to ph thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed after that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates the oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing the oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of the main components cerium whose oxide is insoluble in hno the solution is treated with magnesium nitrate to produce a crystallized mixture of double salts of rare earth metals the salts are separated by ion exchange in this process rare earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin the rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent erbium metal is obtained from its oxide or salts by heating with calcium at c under argon atmosphere applications erbium s everyday uses are varied it is commonly used as a photographic filter and because of its resilience it is useful as a metallurgical additive lasers and optics a large variety of medical applications i e dermatology dentistry utilize erbium ion s nm emission see er yag laser which is highly absorbed in water absorption coefficient about cm such shallow tissue deposition of laser energy is necessary for laser surgery and the efficient production of steam for laser enamel ablation in dentistry erbium doped optical silica glass fibers are the active element in erbium doped fiber amplifiers edfas which are widely used in optical communications the same fibers can be used to create fiber lasers in order to work efficiently erbium doped fiber is usually co doped with glass modifiers homogenizers often aluminum or phosphorus these dopants help prevent clustering of er ions and transfer the energy more efficiently between excitation light also known as optical pump and the signal co doping of optical fiber with er and yb is used in high power er yb fiber lasers erbium can also be used in erbium doped waveguide amplifiers metallurgy when added to vanadium as an alloy erbium lowers hardness and improves workability an erbium nickel alloy er ni has an unusually high specific heat capacity at liquid helium temperatures and is used in cryocoolers a mixture of er co and er yb ni by volume improves the specific heat capacity even more coloring erbium oxide has a pink color and is sometimes used as a colorant for glass cubic zirconia and porcelain the glass is then often used in sunglasses and cheap jewelry other applications erbium is used in nuclear technology in neutron absorbing control rods or as a burnable poison in nuclear fuel design recently erbium has been used in experiments related to lattice confinement fusion biological role erbium does not have a biological role but erbium salts can stimulate metabolism humans consume milligram of erbium a year on average the highest concentration of erbium in humans is in the bones but there is also erbium in the human kidneys and liver toxicity erbium is slightly toxic if ingested but erbium compounds are not toxic metallic erbium in dust form presents a fire and explosion hazard ,68
Thulium,Tm,thulium is a chemical element with the symbol tm and atomic number it is the thirteenth and third last element in the lanthanide series like the other lanthanides the most common oxidation state is seen in its oxide halides and other compounds however the oxidation state can also be stable in aqueous solution like compounds of other late lanthanides soluble thulium compounds form coordination complexes with nine water molecules in the swedish chemist per teodor cleve separated from the rare earth oxide erbia another two previously unknown components which he called holmia and thulia these were the oxides of holmium and thulium respectively a relatively pure sample of thulium metal was first obtained in thulium is the second least abundant of the lanthanides after radioactively unstable promethium which is only found in trace quantities on earth it is an easily workable metal with a bright silvery gray luster it is fairly soft and slowly tarnishes in air

aq tm aq so aq h aq thulium reacts with various metallic and non metallic elements forming a range of binary compounds including tmn tms tmc tm c tmh tmh tmsi tmge tmb tmb and tmb like most lanthanides the state is most common and is the only state observed in thulium solutions thulium exists as a tm ion in solution in this state the thulium ion is surrounded by nine molecules of water tm ions exhibit a bright blue luminescence because it occurs late in the series the oxidation state can also exist stabilized by the nearly full f electron shell but occurs only in solids thulium s only known oxide is tm o this oxide is sometimes called thulia reddish purple thulium ii compounds can be made by the reduction of thulium iii compounds examples of thulium ii compounds include the halides except the fluoride some hydrated thulium compounds such as tmcl h o and tm c o h o are green or greenish white thulium dichloride reacts very vigorously with water this reaction results in hydrogen gas and tm oh exhibiting a fading reddish color combination of thulium and chalcogens results in thulium chalcogenides thulium reacts with hydrogen chloride to produce hydrogen gas and thulium chloride with nitric acid it yields thulium nitrate or tm no isotopes the isotopes of thulium range from tm to tm the primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope tm is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta emission the primary decay products before tm are element erbium isotopes and the primary products after are element ytterbium isotopes thulium is thulium s only primordial isotope and is the only isotope of thulium that is thought to be stable it is predicted to undergo alpha decay to holmium with a very long half life the longest lived radioisotopes are thulium which has a half life of years and thulium which has a half life of days most other isotopes have half lives of a few minutes or less thirty five isotopes and nuclear isomers of thulium have been detected most isotopes of thulium lighter than atomic mass units decay via electron capture or beta plus decay although some exhibit significant alpha decay or proton emission heavier isotopes undergo beta minus decay history thulium was discovered by swedish chemist per teodor cleve in by looking for impurities in the oxides of other rare earth elements this was the same method carl gustaf mosander earlier used to discover some other rare earth elements cleve started by removing all of the known contaminants of erbia er o upon additional processing he obtained two new substances one brown and one green the brown substance was the oxide of the element holmium and was named holmia by cleve and the green substance was the oxide of an unknown element cleve named the oxide thulia and its element thulium after thule an ancient greek place name associated with scandinavia or iceland thulium s atomic symbol was initially tu but later changed to tm thulium was so rare that none of the early workers had enough of it to purify sufficiently to actually see the green color they had to be content with spectroscopically observing the strengthening of the two characteristic absorption bands as erbium was progressively removed the first researcher to obtain nearly pure thulium was charles james a british expatriate working on a large scale at new hampshire college in durham usa in he reported his results having used his discovered method of bromate fractional crystallization to do the purification he famously needed purification operations to establish that the material was homogeneous high purity thulium oxide was first offered commercially in the late s as a result of the adoption of ion exchange separation technology lindsay chemical division of american potash chemical corporation offered it in grades of and purity the price per kilogram oscillated between us and in the period from to for purity and it was the second highest for the lanthanides behind lutetium occurrence the element is never found in nature in pure form but it is found in small quantities in minerals with other rare earths thulium is often found with minerals containing yttrium and gadolinium in particular thulium occurs in the mineral gadolinite however like many other lanthanides thulium also occurs in the minerals monazite xenotime and euxenite thulium has not been found in prevalence over the other rare earths in any mineral yet its abundance in the earth s crust is mg kg by weight and parts per billion by moles thulium makes up approximately parts per million of soil although this value can range from to parts per million thulium makes up parts per quadrillion of seawater in the solar system thulium exists in concentrations of parts per trillion by weight and part per trillion by moles thulium ore occurs most commonly in china however australia brazil greenland india tanzania and the united states also have large reserves of thulium total reserves of thulium are approximately tonnes thulium is the least abundant lanthanide on earth except for the radioactive promethium production thulium is principally extracted from monazite ores thulium found in river sands through ion exchange newer ion exchange and solvent extraction techniques have led to easier separation of the rare earths which has yielded much lower costs for thulium production the principal sources today are the ion adsorption clays of southern china in these where about two thirds of the total rare earth content is yttrium thulium is about or about tied with lutetium for rarity the metal can be isolated through reduction of its oxide with lanthanum metal or by calcium reduction in a closed container none of thulium s natural compounds are commercially important approximately tonnes per year of thulium oxide are produced in thulium oxide cost us per gram and in pure thulium metal powder cost us per gram applications laser holmium chromium thulium triple doped yttrium aluminum garnet ho cr tm yag or ho cr tm yag is an active laser medium material with high efficiency it lases at nm in the infra red and is widely used in military applications medicine and meteorology single element thulium doped yag tm yag lasers operate at nm the wavelength of thulium based lasers is very efficient for superficial ablation of tissue with minimal coagulation depth in air or in water this makes thulium lasers attractive for laser based surgery x ray source despite its high cost portable x ray devices use thulium that has been bombarded with neutrons in a nuclear reactor to produce the isotope thulium having a half life of days and five major emission lines of comparable intensity at and kev these radioactive sources have a useful life of about one year as tools in medical and dental diagnosis as well as to detect defects in inaccessible mechanical and electronic components such sources do not need extensive radiation protection only a small cup of lead they are among the most popular radiation sources for use in industrial radiography thulium is gaining popularity as an x ray source for cancer treatment via brachytherapy sealed source radiation therapy others thulium has been used in high temperature superconductors similarly to yttrium thulium potentially has use in ferrites ceramic magnetic materials that are used in microwave equipment thulium is also similar to scandium in that it is used in arc lighting for its unusual spectrum in this case its green emission lines which are not covered by other elements because thulium fluoresces with a blue color when exposed to ultraviolet light thulium is put into euro banknotes as a measure against counterfeiting the blue fluorescence of tm doped calcium sulfate has been used in personal dosimeters for visual monitoring of radiation tm doped halides in which tm is in its valence state are promising luminescent materials that can make efficient electricity generating windows based on the principle of a luminescent solar concentrator possible biological role and precautions soluble thulium salts are mildly toxic but insoluble thulium salts are completely nontoxic when injected thulium can cause degeneration of the liver and spleen and can also cause hemoglobin concentration to fluctuate liver damage from thulium is more prevalent in male mice than female mice despite this thulium has a low level of toxicity in humans thulium occurs in the highest amounts in the liver kidneys and bones humans typically consume several micrograms of thulium per year the roots of plants do not take up thulium and the dry matter of vegetables usually contains one part per billion of thulium thulium dust and powder are toxic upon inhalation or ingestion and can cause explosions ,69
Ytterbium,Yb,ytterbium is a chemical element with the symbol yb and atomic number it is a metal the fourteenth and penultimate element in the lanthanide series which is the basis of the relative stability of its oxidation state however like the other lanthanides its most common oxidation state is as in its oxide halides and other compounds in aqueous solution like compounds of other late lanthanides soluble ytterbium compounds form complexes with nine water molecules because of its closed shell electron configuration its density and melting and boiling points differ significantly from those of most other lanthanides in the swiss chemist jean charles galissard de marignac separated from the rare earth erbia another independent component which he called ytterbia for ytterby the village in sweden near where he found the new component of erbium he suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called ytterbium in total four elements were named after the village the others being yttrium terbium and erbium in the new earth lutecia was separated from ytterbia from which the element lutecium now lutetium was extracted by georges urbain carl auer von welsbach and charles james after some discussion marignac s name ytterbium was retained a relatively pure sample of the metal was not obtained until at present ytterbium is mainly used as a dopant of stainless steel or active laser media and less often as a gamma ray source natural ytterbium is a mixture of seven stable isotopes which altogether are present at concentrations of parts per million this element is mined in china the united states brazil and india in form of the minerals monazite euxenite and xenotime the ytterbium concentration is low because it is found only among many other rare earth elements moreover it is among the least abundant once extracted and prepared ytterbium is somewhat hazardous as an eye and skin irritant the metal is a fire and explosion hazard characteristics physical properties ytterbium is a soft malleable and ductile chemical element that displays a bright silvery luster when pure it is a rare earth element and it is readily dissolved by the strong mineral acids it reacts slowly with cold water and it oxidizes slowly in air ytterbium has three allotropes labeled by the greek letters alpha beta and gamma their transformation temperatures are c and c although the exact transformation temperature depends on the pressure and stress the beta allotrope g cm exists at room temperature and it has a face centered cubic crystal structure the high temperature gamma allotrope g cm has a body centered cubic crystalline structure the alpha allotrope g cm has a hexagonal crystalline structure and is stable at low temperatures the beta allotrope has a metallic electrical conductivity at normal atmospheric pressure but it becomes a semiconductor when exposed to a pressure of about atmospheres gpa its electrical resistivity increases ten times upon compression to atmospheres gpa but then drops to about of its room temperature resistivity at about atm gpa in contrast with the other rare earth metals which usually have antiferromagnetic and or ferromagnetic properties at low temperatures ytterbium is paramagnetic at temperatures above kelvin however the alpha allotrope is diamagnetic with a melting point of c and a boiling point of c ytterbium has the smallest liquid range of all the metals contrary to most other lanthanides which have a close packed hexagonal lattice ytterbium crystallizes in the face centered cubic system ytterbium has a density of g cm which is significantly lower than those of the neighboring lanthanides thulium g cm and lutetium g cm its melting and boiling points are also significantly lower than those of thulium and lutetium this is due to the closed shell electron configuration of ytterbium xe f s which causes only the two s electrons to be available for metallic bonding in contrast to the other lanthanides where three electrons are available and increases ytterbium s metallic radius chemical properties ytterbium metal tarnishes slowly in air taking on a golden or brown hue finely dispersed ytterbium readily oxidizes in air and under oxygen mixtures of powdered ytterbium with polytetrafluoroethylene or hexachloroethane burn with a luminous emerald green flame ytterbium reacts with hydrogen to form various non stoichiometric hydrides ytterbium dissolves slowly in water but quickly in acids liberating hydrogen gas ytterbium is quite electropositive and it reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form ytterbium iii hydroxide yb s h o l yb oh aq h g ytterbium reacts with all the halogens yb s f g ybf s white yb s cl g ybcl s white yb s br g ybbr s white yb s i g ybi s white the ytterbium iii ion absorbs light in the near infrared range of wavelengths but not in visible light so ytterbia yb o is white in color and the salts of ytterbium are also colorless ytterbium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions that contain the colorless yb iii ions which exist as nonahydrate complexes yb s h so aq h o l yb h o aq so aq h g yb ii vs yb iii although usually trivalent ytterbium readily forms divalent compounds this behavior is unusual for lanthanides which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of the state has a valence electron configuration of f because the fully filled f shell gives more stability the yellow green ytterbium ii ion is a very strong reducing agent and decomposes water releasing hydrogen gas and thus only the colorless ytterbium iii ion occurs in aqueous solution samarium and thulium also behave this way in the state but europium ii is stable in aqueous solution ytterbium metal behaves similarly to europium metal and the alkaline earth metals dissolving in ammonia to form blue electride salts isotopes natural ytterbium is composed of seven stable isotopes yb yb yb yb yb yb and yb with yb being the most common at of the natural abundance radioisotopes have been observed with the most stable ones being yb with a half life of days yb with a half life of days and yb with a half life of hours all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are less than two hours and most of these have half lives under minutes ytterbium also has meta states with the most stable being myb t seconds the isotopes of ytterbium range in atomic weight from atomic mass unit u for yb to u for yb the primary decay mode of ytterbium isotopes lighter than the most abundant stable isotope yb is electron capture and the primary decay mode for those heavier than yb is beta decay the primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes lighter than yb are thulium isotopes and the primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes with heavier than yb are lutetium isotopes occurrence ytterbium is found with other rare earth elements in several rare minerals it is most often recovered commercially from monazite sand ytterbium the element is also found in euxenite and xenotime the main mining areas are china the united states brazil india sri lanka and australia reserves of ytterbium are estimated as one million tonnes ytterbium is normally difficult to separate from other rare earths but ion exchange and solvent extraction techniques developed in the mid to late th century have simplified separation compounds of ytterbium are rare and have not yet been well characterized the abundance of ytterbium in the earth s crust is about mg kg as an even numbered lanthanide in accordance with the oddo harkins rule ytterbium is significantly more abundant than its immediate neighbors thulium and lutetium which occur in the same concentrate at levels of about each the world production of ytterbium is only about tonnes per year reflecting that it has few commercial applications microscopic traces of ytterbium are used as a dopant in the yb yag laser a solid state laser in which ytterbium is the element that undergoes stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation ytterbium is often the most common substitute in yttrium minerals in very few known cases occurrences ytterbium prevails over yttrium as e g in xenotime yb a report of native ytterbium from the moon s regolith is known production it is relatively difficult to separate ytterbium from other lanthanides due to its similar properties as a result the process is somewhat long first minerals such as monazite or xenotime are dissolved into various acids such as sulfuric acid ytterbium can then be separated from other lanthanides by ion exchange as can other lanthanides the solution is then applied to a resin which different lanthanides bind in different matters this is then dissolved using complexing agents and due to the different types of bonding exhibited by the different lanthanides it is possible to isolate the compounds ytterbium is separated from other rare earths either by ion exchange or by reduction with sodium amalgam in the latter method a buffered acidic solution of trivalent rare earths is treated with molten sodium mercury alloy which reduces and dissolves yb the alloy is treated with hydrochloric acid the metal is extracted from the solution as oxalate and converted to oxide by heating the oxide is reduced to metal by heating with lanthanum aluminium cerium or zirconium in high vacuum the metal is purified by sublimation and collected over a condensed plate compounds the chemical behavior of ytterbium is similar to that of the rest of the lanthanides most ytterbium compounds are found in the oxidation state and its salts in this oxidation state are nearly colorless like europium samarium and thulium the trihalides of ytterbium can be reduced to the dihalides by hydrogen zinc dust or by the addition of metallic ytterbium the oxidation state occurs only in solid compounds and reacts in some ways similarly to the alkaline earth metal compounds for example ytterbium ii oxide ybo shows the same structure as calcium oxide cao halides ytterbium forms both dihalides and trihalides with the halogens fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine the dihalides are susceptible to oxidation to the trihalides at room temperature and disproportionate to the trihalides and metallic ytterbium at high temperature ybx ybx yb x f cl br i some ytterbium halides are used as reagents in organic synthesis for example ytterbium iii chloride ybcl is a lewis acid and can be used as a catalyst in the aldol and diels alder reactions ytterbium ii iodide ybi may be used like samarium ii iodide as a reducing agent for coupling reactions ytterbium iii fluoride ybf is used as an inert and non toxic tooth filling as it continuously releases fluoride ions which are good for dental health and is also a good x ray contrast agent oxides ytterbium reacts with oxygen to form ytterbium iii oxide yb o which crystallizes in the rare earth c type sesquioxide structure which is related to the fluorite structure with one quarter of the anions removed leading to ytterbium atoms in two different six coordinate non octahedral environments ytterbium iii oxide can be reduced to ytterbium ii oxide ybo with elemental ytterbium which crystallizes in the same structure as sodium chloride borides ytterbium dodecaboride ybb is a crystalline material that has been studied to understand various electronic and structural properties of many chemically related substances it is a kondo insulator it is a quantum material under normal conditions the interior of the bulk crystal is an insulator whereas the surface is highly conductive among the rare earth elements ytterbium is one of the few that can form a stable dodecaboride a property attributed to its comparatively small atomic radius history ytterbium was discovered by the swiss chemist jean charles galissard de marignac in the year while examining samples of gadolinite marignac found a new component in the earth then known as erbia and he named it ytterbia for ytterby the swedish village near where he found the new component of erbium marignac suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called ytterbium in the french chemist georges urbain separated marignac s ytterbia into two components neoytterbia and lutecia neoytterbia later became known as the element ytterbium and lutecia became known as the element lutetium the austrian chemist carl auer von welsbach independently isolated these elements from ytterbia at about the same time but he called them aldebaranium and cassiopeium the american chemist charles james also independently isolated these elements at about the same time urbain and welsbach accused each other of publishing results based on the other party the commission on atomic mass consisting of frank wigglesworth clarke wilhelm ostwald and georges urbain which was then responsible for the attribution of new element names settled the dispute in by granting priority to urbain and adopting his names as official ones based on the fact that the separation of lutetium from marignac s ytterbium was first described by urbain after urbain s names were recognized neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium the chemical and physical properties of ytterbium could not be determined with any precision until when the first nearly pure ytterbium metal was produced by using ion exchange processes the price of ytterbium was relatively stable between and at about us kg applications source of gamma rays the yb isotope with a half life of days which is created along with the short lived yb isotope half life days by neutron activation during the irradiation of ytterbium in nuclear reactors has been used as a radiation source in portable x ray machines like x rays the gamma rays emitted by the source pass through soft tissues of the body but are blocked by bones and other dense materials thus small yb samples which emit gamma rays act like tiny x ray machines useful for radiography of small objects experiments show that radiographs taken with a yb source are roughly equivalent to those taken with x rays having energies between and kev yb is also used in nuclear medicine high stability atomic clocks ytterbium clocks hold the record for stability with ticks stable to within less than two parts in quintillion the clocks developed at the national institute of standards and technology nist rely on about rare earth atoms cooled to microkelvin millionths of a degree above absolute zero and trapped in an optical lattice a series of pancake shaped wells made of laser light another laser that ticks trillion times per second provokes a transition between two energy levels in the atoms the large number of atoms is key to the clocks high stability visible light waves oscillate faster than microwaves and therefore optical clocks can be more precise than caesium atomic clocks the physikalisch technische bundesanstalt is working on several such optical clocks the model with one single ytterbium ion caught in an ion trap is highly accurate the optical clock based on it is exact to digits after the decimal point a pair of experimental atomic clocks based on ytterbium atoms at the national institute of standards and technology has set a record for stability nist physicists reported in the august issue of science express that the ytterbium clocks ticks are stable to within less than two parts in quintillion followed by zeros roughly times better than the previous best published results for other atomic clocks the clocks would be accurate within a second for a period comparable to the age of the universe doping of stainless steel ytterbium can also be used as a dopant to help improve the grain refinement strength and other mechanical properties of stainless steel some ytterbium alloys have rarely been used in dentistry ytterbium as dopant of active media the yb ion is used as a doping material in active laser media specifically in solid state lasers and double clad fiber lasers ytterbium lasers are highly efficient have long lifetimes and can generate short pulses ytterbium can also easily be incorporated into the material used to make the laser ytterbium lasers commonly radiate in the m band being optically pumped at wavelength nm m dependently on the host and application the small quantum defect makes ytterbium a prospective dopant for efficient lasers and power scaling the kinetic of excitations in ytterbium doped materials is simple and can be described within the concept of effective cross sections for most ytterbium doped laser materials as for many other optically pumped gain media the mccumber relation holds although the application to the ytterbium doped composite materials was under discussion usually low concentrations of ytterbium are used at high concentrations the ytterbium doped materials show photodarkening glass fibers or even a switch to broadband emission crystals and ceramics instead of efficient laser action this effect may be related with not only overheating but also with conditions of charge compensation at high concentrations of ytterbium ions much progress has been made in the power scaling lasers and amplifiers produced with ytterbium yb doped optical fibers power levels have increased from the kw regimes due to the advancements in components as well as the yb doped fibers fabrication of low na large mode area fibers enable achievement of near perfect beam qualities m at power levels of kw to greater than kw at nm in a broadband configuration ytterbium doped lma fibers also have the advantages of a larger mode field diameter which negates the impacts of nonlinear effects such as stimulated brillouin scattering and stimulated raman scattering which limit the achievement of higher power levels and provide a distinct advantage over single mode ytterbium doped fibers in order to achieve even higher power levels in ytterbium based fiber systems all factors of the fiber must be considered these can be achieved only via optimization of all the ytterbium fiber parameters ranging from the core background losses to the geometrical properties in order to reduce the splice losses within the cavity power scaling also requires optimization of matching passive fibers within the optical cavity the optimization of the ytterbium doped glass itself through host glass modification of various dopants also plays a large part in reducing the background loss of the glass improvements in slope efficiency of the fiber and improved photodarkening performance all of which contribute to increased power levels in m systems ion qubits for quantum computing the charged ion yb is used in trapped ion qubits in quantum computing entangling gates such as the m lmer s rensen gate have been achieved by addressing the ions with mode locked pulse lasers others ytterbium metal increases its electrical resistivity when subjected to high stresses this property is used in stress gauges to monitor ground deformations from earthquakes and explosions currently ytterbium is being investigated as a possible replacement for magnesium in high density pyrotechnic payloads for kinematic infrared decoy flares as ytterbium iii oxide has a significantly higher emissivity in the infrared range than magnesium oxide a higher radiant intensity is obtained with ytterbium based payloads in comparison to those commonly based on magnesium teflon viton mtv precautions although ytterbium is fairly stable chemically it is stored in airtight containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen filled dry box to protect it from air and moisture all compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic although studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal however ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes and some might be teratogenic metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust and the resulting fumes are hazardous ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water and only dry chemical class d fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires ,70
Lutetium,Lu,lutetium is a chemical element with the symbol lu and atomic number it is a silvery white metal which resists corrosion in dry air but not in moist air lutetium is the last element in the lanthanide series and it is traditionally counted among the rare earths lutetium is generally considered the first element of the th period transition metals by those who study the matter although there has been some dispute on this point lutetium was independently discovered in by french scientist georges urbain austrian mineralogist baron carl auer von welsbach and american chemist charles james all of these researchers found lutetium as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia which was previously thought to consist entirely of ytterbium the dispute on the priority of the discovery occurred shortly after with urbain and welsbach accusing each other of publishing results influenced by the published research of the other the naming honor went to urbain as he had published his results earlier he chose the name lutecium for the new element but in the spelling was changed to lutetium in the priority was finally granted to urbain and his names were adopted as official ones however the name cassiopeium or later cassiopium for element proposed by welsbach was used by many german scientists until the s lutetium is not a particularly abundant element although it is significantly more common than silver in the earth s crust it has few specific uses lutetium is a relatively abundant radioactive isotope with a half life of about billion years used to determine the age of minerals and meteorites lutetium usually occurs in association with the element yttrium and is sometimes used in metal alloys and as a catalyst in various chemical reactions lu dota tate is used for radionuclide therapy see nuclear medicine on neuroendocrine tumours lutetium has the highest brinell hardness of any lanthanide at mpa characteristics physical properties a lutetium atom has electrons arranged in the configuration xe f d s when entering a chemical reaction the atom loses its two outermost electrons and the single d electron the lutetium atom is the smallest among the lanthanide atoms due to the lanthanide contraction and as a result lutetium has the highest density melting point and hardness of the lanthanides chemical properties and compounds lutetium s compounds always contain the element in the oxidation state aqueous solutions of most lutetium salts are colorless and form white crystalline solids upon drying with the common exception of the iodide the soluble salts such as nitrate sulfate and acetate form hydrates upon crystallization the oxide hydroxide fluoride carbonate phosphate and oxalate are insoluble in water lutetium metal is slightly unstable in air at standard conditions but it burns readily at c to form lutetium oxide the resulting compound is known to absorb water and carbon dioxide and it may be used to remove vapors of these compounds from closed atmospheres similar observations are made during reaction between lutetium and water slow when cold and fast when hot lutetium hydroxide is formed in the reaction lutetium metal is known to react with the four lightest halogens to form trihalides all of them except the fluoride are soluble in water lutetium dissolves readily in weak acids and dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the colorless lutetium ions which are coordinated by between seven and nine water molecules the average being lu h o lu h so lu so h oxidation states lutetium is usually found in the oxidation state like most other lanthanides however it can also be in the and states as well isotopes lutetium occurs on the earth in form of two isotopes lutetium and lutetium out of these two only the former is stable making the element monoisotopic the latter one lutetium decays via beta decay with a half life of years it makes up about of natural lutetium to date synthetic radioisotopes of the element have been characterized ranging in mass number from to the most stable such isotopes are lutetium with a half life of years and lutetium with a half life of years all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are less than days and the majority of these have half lives that are less than half an hour isotopes lighter than the stable lutetium decay via electron capture to produce isotopes of ytterbium with some alpha and positron emission the heavier isotopes decay primarily via beta decay producing hafnium isotopes the element also has nuclear isomers with masses of and not every mass number corresponds to only one isomer the most stable of them are lutetium m with a half life of days and lutetium m with a half life of days these are longer than the half lives of the ground states of all radioactive lutetium isotopes except lutetium and history lutetium derived from the latin lutetia paris was independently discovered in by french scientist georges urbain austrian mineralogist baron carl auer von welsbach and american chemist charles james they found it as an impurity in ytterbia which was thought by swiss chemist jean charles galissard de marignac to consist entirely of ytterbium the scientists proposed different names for the elements urbain chose neoytterbium and lutecium whereas welsbach chose aldebaranium and cassiopeium after aldebaran and cassiopeia both of these articles accused the other man of publishing results based on those of the author the international commission on atomic weights which was then responsible for the attribution of new element names settled the dispute in by granting priority to urbain and adopting his names as official ones based on the fact that the separation of lutetium from marignac s ytterbium was first described by urbain after urbain s names were recognized neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium until the s some german speaking chemists called lutetium by welsbach s name cassiopeium in the spelling of element was changed to lutetium the reason for this was that welsbach s samples of lutetium had been pure while urbain s samples only contained traces of lutetium this later misled urbain into thinking that he had discovered element which he named celtium which was actually very pure lutetium the later discrediting of urbain s work on element led to a reappraisal of welsbach s work on element so that the element was renamed to cassiopeium in german speaking countries for some time charles james who stayed out of the priority argument worked on a much larger scale and possessed the largest supply of lutetium at the time pure lutetium metal was first produced in occurrence and production found with almost all other rare earth metals but never by itself lutetium is very difficult to separate from other elements its principal commercial source is as a by product from the processing of the rare earth phosphate mineral monazite ce la po which has concentrations of only of the element not much higher than the abundance of lutetium in the earth crust of about mg kg no lutetium dominant minerals are currently known the main mining areas are china united states brazil india sri lanka and australia the world production of lutetium in the form of oxide is about tonnes per year pure lutetium metal is very difficult to prepare it is one of the rarest and most expensive of the rare earth metals with the price about us per kilogram or about one fourth that of gold crushed minerals are treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water soluble sulfates of rare earths thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed after that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates the oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing the oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of the main components cerium whose oxide is insoluble in hno several rare earth metals including lutetium are separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization lutetium is separated by ion exchange in this process rare earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin lutetium salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent lutetium metal is then obtained by reduction of anhydrous lucl or luf by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal lucl ca lu cacl applications because of production difficulty and high price lutetium has very few commercial uses especially since it is rarer than most of the other lanthanides but is chemically not very different however stable lutetium can be used as catalysts in petroleum cracking in refineries and can also be used in alkylation hydrogenation and polymerization applications lutetium aluminium garnet al lu o has been proposed for use as a lens material in high refractive index immersion lithography additionally a tiny amount of lutetium is added as a dopant to gadolinium gallium garnet which is used in magnetic bubble memory devices cerium doped lutetium oxyorthosilicate is currently the preferred compound for detectors in positron emission tomography pet lutetium aluminium garnet luag is used as a phosphor in light emitting diode light bulbs aside from stable lutetium its radioactive isotopes have several specific uses the suitable half life and decay mode made lutetium used as a pure beta emitter using lutetium which has been exposed to neutron activation and in lutetium hafnium dating to date meteorites the synthetic isotope lutetium bound to octreotate a somatostatin analogue is used experimentally in targeted radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors indeed lutetium is seeing increased usage as a radionuclide in neuroendrocine tumor therapy and bone pain palliation research indicates that lutetium ion atomic clocks could provide greater accuracy than any existing atomic clock lutetium tantalate lutao is the densest known stable white material density g cm and therefore is an ideal host for x ray phosphors the only denser white material is thorium dioxide with density of g cm but the thorium it contains is radioactive precautions like other rare earth metals lutetium is regarded as having a low degree of toxicity but its compounds should be handled with care nonetheless for example lutetium fluoride inhalation is dangerous and the compound irritates skin lutetium nitrate may be dangerous as it may explode and burn once heated lutetium oxide powder is toxic as well if inhaled or ingested similarly to the other rare earth metals lutetium has no known biological role but it is found even in humans concentrating in bones and to a lesser extent in the liver and kidneys lutetium salts are known to occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature the element is the least abundant in the human body of all lanthanides human diets have not been monitored for lutetium content so it is not known how much the average human takes in but estimations show the amount is only about several micrograms per year all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants soluble lutetium salts are mildly toxic but insoluble ones are not ,71
Hafnium,Hf,hafnium is a chemical element with the symbol hf and atomic number a lustrous silvery gray tetravalent transition metal hafnium chemically resembles zirconium and is found in many zirconium minerals its existence was predicted by dmitri mendeleev in though it was not identified until by dirk coster and george de hevesy making it the penultimate stable element to be discovered the last being rhenium in hafnium is named after hafnia the latin name for copenhagen where it was discovered hafnium is used in filaments and electrodes some semiconductor fabrication processes use its oxide for integrated circuits at nanometers and smaller feature lengths some superalloys used for special applications contain hafnium in combination with niobium titanium or tungsten hafnium s large neutron capture cross section makes it a good material for neutron absorption in control rods in nuclear power plants but at the same time requires that it be removed from the neutron transparent corrosion resistant zirconium alloys used in nuclear reactors characteristics physical characteristics hafnium is a shiny silvery ductile metal that is corrosion resistant and chemically similar to zirconium due to its having the same number of valence electrons being in the same group but also to relativistic effects the expected expansion of atomic radii from period to is almost exactly cancelled out by the lanthanide contraction hafnium changes from its alpha form a hexagonal close packed lattice to its beta form a body centered cubic lattice at k the physical properties of hafnium metal samples are markedly affected by zirconium impurities especially the nuclear properties as these two elements are among the most difficult to separate because of their chemical similarity a notable physical difference between these metals is their density with zirconium having about one half the density of hafnium the most notable nuclear properties of hafnium are its high thermal neutron capture cross section and that the nuclei of several different hafnium isotopes readily absorb two or more neutrons apiece in contrast with this zirconium is practically transparent to thermal neutrons and it is commonly used for the metal components of nuclear reactors especially the cladding of their nuclear fuel rods chemical characteristics hafnium reacts in air to form a protective film that inhibits further corrosion the metal is not readily attacked by acids but can be oxidized with halogens or it can be burnt in air like its sister metal zirconium finely divided hafnium can ignite spontaneously in air the metal is resistant to concentrated alkalis as a consequence of lanthanide contraction the chemistry of hafnium and zirconium is so similar that the two cannot be separated on the basis of differing chemical reactions the melting points and boiling points of the compounds and the solubility in solvents are the major differences in the chemistry of these twin elements isotopes at least isotopes of hafnium have been observed ranging in mass number from to the five stable isotopes are in the range of to the radioactive isotopes half lives range from ms for hf to years for the most stable one the primordial hf the extinct radionuclide hf has a half life of million years and is an important tracker isotope for the formation of planetary cores the nuclear isomer m hf was at the center of a controversy for several years regarding its potential use as a weapon occurrence hafnium is estimated to make up about ppm of the earth s upper crust by mass it does not exist as a free element on earth but is found combined in solid solution with zirconium in natural zirconium compounds such as zircon zrsio which usually has about of the zr replaced by hf rarely the hf zr ratio increases during crystallization to give the isostructural mineral hafnon hf zr sio with atomic hf zr an obsolete name for a variety of zircon containing unusually high hf content is alvite a major source of zircon and hence hafnium ores is heavy mineral sands ore deposits pegmatites particularly in brazil and malawi and carbonatite intrusions particularly the crown polymetallic deposit at mount weld western australia a potential source of hafnium is trachyte tuffs containing rare zircon hafnium silicates eudialyte or armstrongite at dubbo in new south wales australia production the heavy mineral sands ore deposits of the titanium ores ilmenite and rutile yield most of the mined zirconium and therefore also most of the hafnium zirconium is a good nuclear fuel rod cladding metal with the desirable properties of a very low neutron capture cross section and good chemical stability at high temperatures however because of hafnium s neutron absorbing properties hafnium impurities in zirconium would cause it to be far less useful for nuclear reactor applications thus a nearly complete separation of zirconium and hafnium is necessary for their use in nuclear power the production of hafnium free zirconium is the main source for hafnium the chemical properties of hafnium and zirconium are nearly identical which makes the two difficult to separate the methods first used fractional crystallization of ammonium fluoride salts or the fractional distillation of the chloride have not proven suitable for an industrial scale production after zirconium was chosen as material for nuclear reactor programs in the s a separation method had to be developed liquid liquid extraction processes with a wide variety of solvents were developed and are still used for the production of hafnium about half of all hafnium metal manufactured is produced as a by product of zirconium refinement the end product of the separation is hafnium iv chloride the purified hafnium iv chloride is converted to the metal by reduction with magnesium or sodium as in the kroll process hfcl mg o c hf mgcl displaystyle ce hfcl mg oc hf mgcl further purification is effected by a chemical transport reaction developed by arkel and de boer in a closed vessel hafnium reacts with iodine at temperatures of c f forming hafnium iv iodide at a tungsten filament of c f the reverse reaction happens preferentially and the chemically bound iodine and hafnium dissociate into the native elements the hafnium forms a solid coating at the tungsten filament and the iodine can react with additional hafnium resulting in a steady iodine turnover and ensuring the chemical equilibrium remains in favor of hafnium production hf i o c hfi displaystyle ce hf i oc hfi hfi o c hf i displaystyle ce hfi oc hf i chemical compounds due to the lanthanide contraction the ionic radius of hafnium iv ngstr m is almost the same as that of zirconium iv angstroms consequently compounds of hafnium iv and zirconium iv have very similar chemical and physical properties hafnium and zirconium tend to occur together in nature and the similarity of their ionic radii makes their chemical separation rather difficult hafnium tends to form inorganic compounds in the oxidation state of halogens react with it to form hafnium tetrahalides at higher temperatures hafnium reacts with oxygen nitrogen carbon boron sulfur and silicon some compounds of hafnium in lower oxidation states are known hafnium iv chloride and hafnium iv iodide have some applications in the production and purification of hafnium metal they are volatile solids with polymeric structures these tetrachlorides are precursors to various organohafnium compounds such as hafnocene dichloride and tetrabenzylhafnium the white hafnium oxide hfo with a melting point of c and a boiling point of roughly c is very similar to zirconia but slightly more basic hafnium carbide is the most refractory binary compound known with a melting point over c and hafnium nitride is the most refractory of all known metal nitrides with a melting point of c this has led to proposals that hafnium or its carbides might be useful as construction materials that are subjected to very high temperatures the mixed carbide tantalum hafnium carbide ta hfc possesses the highest melting point of any currently known compound k c f recent supercomputer simulations suggest a hafnium alloy with a melting point of k history in his report on the periodic law of the chemical elements in dmitri mendeleev had implicitly predicted the existence of a heavier analog of titanium and zirconium at the time of his formulation in mendeleev believed that the elements were ordered by their atomic masses and placed lanthanum element in the spot below zirconium the exact placement of the elements and the location of missing elements was done by determining the specific weight of the elements and comparing the chemical and physical properties the x ray spectroscopy done by henry moseley in showed a direct dependency between spectral line and effective nuclear charge this led to the nuclear charge or atomic number of an element being used to ascertain its place within the periodic table with this method moseley determined the number of lanthanides and showed the gaps in the atomic number sequence at numbers and the discovery of the gaps led to an extensive search for the missing elements in several people claimed the discovery after henry moseley predicted the gap in the periodic table for the then undiscovered element georges urbain asserted that he found element in the rare earth elements in and published his results on celtium in neither the spectra nor the chemical behavior he claimed matched with the element found later and therefore his claim was turned down after a long standing controversy the controversy was partly because the chemists favored the chemical techniques which led to the discovery of celtium while the physicists relied on the use of the new x ray spectroscopy method that proved that the substances discovered by urbain did not contain element in charles r bury suggested that element should resemble zirconium and therefore was not part of the rare earth elements group by early niels bohr and others agreed with bury these suggestions were based on bohr s theories of the atom which were identical to chemist charles bury the x ray spectroscopy of moseley and the chemical arguments of friedrich paneth encouraged by these suggestions and by the reappearance in of urbain s claims that element was a rare earth element discovered in dirk coster and georg von hevesy were motivated to search for the new element in zirconium ores hafnium was discovered by the two in in copenhagen denmark validating the original prediction of mendeleev it was ultimately found in zircon in norway through x ray spectroscopy analysis the place where the discovery took place led to the element being named for the latin name for copenhagen hafnia the home town of niels bohr today the faculty of science of the university of copenhagen uses in its seal a stylized image of the hafnium atom hafnium was separated from zirconium through repeated recrystallization of the double ammonium or potassium fluorides by valdemar thal jantzen and von hevesey anton eduard van arkel and jan hendrik de boer were the first to prepare metallic hafnium by passing hafnium tetraiodide vapor over a heated tungsten filament in this process for differential purification of zirconium and hafnium is still in use today in six predicted elements were still missing from the periodic table technetium promethium astatine and francium are radioactive elements and are only present in trace amounts in the environment thus making elements rhenium and hafnium the last two unknown non radioactive elements applications most of the hafnium produced is used in the manufacture of control rods for nuclear reactors several details contribute to the fact that there are only a few technical uses for hafnium first the close similarity between hafnium and zirconium makes it possible to use the more abundant zirconium for most applications second hafnium was first available as pure metal after the use in the nuclear industry for hafnium free zirconium in the late s furthermore the low abundance and difficult separation techniques necessary make it a scarce commodity when the demand for hafnium free zirconium dropped following the fukushima disaster the price of hafnium increased sharply from around kg in to around kg in nuclear reactors the nuclei of several hafnium isotopes can each absorb multiple neutrons this makes hafnium a good material for use in the control rods for nuclear reactors its neutron capture cross section capture resonance integral io barns is about times that of zirconium other elements that are good neutron absorbers for control rods are cadmium and boron excellent mechanical properties and exceptional corrosion resistance properties allow its use in the harsh environment of pressurized water reactors the german research reactor frm ii uses hafnium as a neutron absorber it is also common in military reactors particularly in us naval reactors but seldom found in civilian ones the first core of the shippingport atomic power station a conversion of a naval reactor being a notable exception alloys hafnium is used in alloys with iron titanium niobium tantalum and other metals an alloy used for liquid rocket thruster nozzles for example the main engine of the apollo lunar modules is c which consists of niobium hafnium and titanium small additions of hafnium increase the adherence of protective oxide scales on nickel based alloys it improves thereby the corrosion resistance especially under cyclic temperature conditions that tend to break oxide scales by inducing thermal stresses between the bulk material and the oxide layer microprocessors hafnium based compounds are employed in gate insulators in the nm generation of integrated circuits from intel ibm and others hafnium oxide based compounds are practical high k dielectrics allowing reduction of the gate leakage current which improves performance at such scales isotope geochemistry isotopes of hafnium and lutetium along with ytterbium are also used in isotope geochemistry and geochronological applications in lutetium hafnium dating it is often used as a tracer of isotopic evolution of earth s mantle through time this is because lu decays to hf with a half life of approximately billion years in most geologic materials zircon is the dominant host of hafnium ppm and is often the focus of hafnium studies in geology hafnium is readily substituted into the zircon crystal lattice and is therefore very resistant to hafnium mobility and contamination zircon also has an extremely low lu hf ratio making any correction for initial lutetium minimal although the lu hf system can be used to calculate a model age i e the time at which it was derived from a given isotopic reservoir such as the depleted mantle these ages do not carry the same geologic significance as do other geochronological techniques as the results often yield isotopic mixtures and thus provide an average age of the material from which it was derived garnet is another mineral that contains appreciable amounts of hafnium to act as a geochronometer the high and variable lu hf ratios found in garnet make it useful for dating metamorphic events other uses due to its heat resistance and its affinity to oxygen and nitrogen hafnium is a good scavenger for oxygen and nitrogen in gas filled and incandescent lamps hafnium is also used as the electrode in plasma cutting because of its ability to shed electrons into air the high energy content of m hf was the concern of a darpa funded program in the us this program eventually concluded that using the above mentioned m hf nuclear isomer of hafnium to construct high yield weapons with x ray triggering mechanisms an application of induced gamma emission was infeasible because of its expense see hafnium controversy hafnium metallocene compounds can be prepared from hafnium tetrachloride and various cyclopentadiene type ligand species perhaps the simplest hafnium metallocene is hafnocene dichloride hafnium metallocenes are part of a large collection of group transition metal metallocene catalysts that are used worldwide in the production of polyolefin resins like polyethylene and polypropylene a pyridyl amidohafnium catalyst can be used for the controlled iso selective polymerization of propylene which can then be combined with polyethylene to make a much tougher recycled plastic hafnium diselenide is studied in spintronics thanks to its charge density wave and superconductivity precautions care needs to be taken when machining hafnium because it is pyrophoric fine particles can spontaneously combust when exposed to air compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people the pure metal is not considered toxic but hafnium compounds should be handled as if they were toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds people can be exposed to hafnium in the workplace by breathing it in swallowing it skin contact and eye contact the occupational safety and health administration osha has set the legal limit permissible exposure limit for exposure to hafnium and hafnium compounds in the workplace as twa mg m over an hour workday the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set the same recommended exposure limit rel at levels of mg m hafnium is immediately dangerous to life and health ,72
Tantalum,Ta,tantalum is a chemical element with the symbol ta and atomic number previously known as tantalium it is named after tantalus a villain in greek mythology tantalum is a very hard ductile lustrous blue gray transition metal that is highly corrosion resistant it is part of the refractory metals group which are widely used as components of strong high melting point alloys it is a group element along with vanadium and niobium and it always occurs in geologic sources together with the chemically similar niobium mainly in the mineral groups tantalite columbite and coltan the chemical inertness and very high melting point of tantalum make it valuable for laboratory and industrial equipment such as reaction vessels and vacuum furnaces it is used in tantalum capacitors for electronic equipment such as computers tantalum is considered a technology critical element by the european commission history tantalum was discovered in sweden in by anders ekeberg in two mineral samples one from sweden and the other from finland one year earlier charles hatchett had discovered columbium now niobium and in the english chemist william hyde wollaston compared its oxide columbite with a density of g cm to that of tantalum tantalite with a density of g cm he concluded that the two oxides despite their difference in measured density were identical and kept the name tantalum after friedrich w hler confirmed these results it was thought that columbium and tantalum were the same element this conclusion was disputed in by the german chemist heinrich rose who argued that there were two additional elements in the tantalite sample and he named them after the children of tantalus niobium from niobe the goddess of tears and pelopium from pelops the supposed element pelopium was later identified as a mixture of tantalum and niobium and it was found that the niobium was identical to the columbium already discovered in by hatchett the differences between tantalum and niobium were demonstrated unequivocally in by christian wilhelm blomstrand and henri etienne sainte claire deville as well as by louis j troost who determined the empirical formulas of some of their compounds in further confirmation came from the swiss chemist jean charles galissard de marignac in who proved that there were only two elements these discoveries did not stop scientists from publishing articles about the so called ilmenium until de marignac was the first to produce the metallic form of tantalum in when he reduced tantalum chloride by heating it in an atmosphere of hydrogen early investigators had only been able to produce impure tantalum and the first relatively pure ductile metal was produced by werner von bolton in charlottenburg in wires made with metallic tantalum were used for light bulb filaments until tungsten replaced it in widespread use the name tantalum was derived from the name of the mythological tantalus the father of niobe in greek mythology in the story he had been punished after death by being condemned to stand knee deep in water with perfect fruit growing above his head both of which eternally tantalized him if he bent to drink the water it drained below the level he could reach and if he reached for the fruit the branches moved out of his grasp anders ekeberg wrote this metal i call tantalum partly in allusion to its incapacity when immersed in acid to absorb any and be saturated for decades the commercial technology for separating tantalum from niobium involved the fractional crystallization of potassium heptafluorotantalate away from potassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate a process that was discovered by jean charles galissard de marignac in this method has been supplanted by solvent extraction from fluoride containing solutions of tantalum characteristics physical properties tantalum is dark blue gray dense ductile very hard easily fabricated and highly conductive of heat and electricity the metal is renowned for its resistance to corrosion by acids in fact at temperatures below c tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive aqua regia it can be dissolved with hydrofluoric acid or acidic solutions containing the fluoride ion and sulfur trioxide as well as with a solution of potassium hydroxide tantalum s high melting point of c boiling point c is exceeded among the elements only by tungsten rhenium and osmium for metals and carbon tantalum exists in two crystalline phases alpha and beta the alpha phase is relatively ductile and soft it has body centered cubic structure space group im m lattice constant a nm knoop hardness hn and electrical resistivity cm the beta phase is hard and brittle its crystal symmetry is tetragonal space group p mnm a nm c nm knoop hardness is hn and electrical resistivity is relatively high at cm the beta phase is metastable and converts to the alpha phase upon heating to c bulk tantalum is almost entirely alpha phase and the beta phase usually exists as thin films obtained by magnetron sputtering chemical vapor deposition or electrochemical deposition from a eutectic molten salt solution isotopes natural tantalum consists of two isotopes mta and ta ta is a stable isotope mta m denotes a metastable state is predicted to decay in three ways isomeric transition to the ground state of ta beta decay to w or electron capture to hf however radioactivity of this nuclear isomer has never been observed and only a lower limit on its half life of years has been set the ground state of ta has a half life of only hours mta is the only naturally occurring nuclear isomer excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short lived nuclides it is also the rarest primordial isotope in the universe taking into account the elemental abundance of tantalum and isotopic abundance of mta in the natural mixture of isotopes and again excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short lived nuclides tantalum has been examined theoretically as a salting material for nuclear weapons cobalt is the better known hypothetical salting material an external shell of ta would be irradiated by the intensive high energy neutron flux from a hypothetical exploding nuclear weapon this would transmute the tantalum into the radioactive isotope ta which has a half life of days and produces gamma rays with approximately million electron volts mev of energy apiece which would significantly increase the radioactivity of the nuclear fallout from the explosion for several months such salted weapons have never been built or tested as far as is publicly known and certainly never used as weapons tantalum can be used as a target material for accelerated proton beams for the production of various short lived isotopes including li rb and yb chemical compounds tantalum forms compounds in oxidation states iii to v most commonly encountered are oxides of ta v which includes all minerals the chemical properties of ta and nb are very similar in aqueous media ta only exhibit the v oxidation state like niobium tantalum is barely soluble in dilute solutions of hydrochloric sulfuric nitric and phosphoric acids due to the precipitation of hydrous ta v oxide in basic media ta can be solubilized due to the formation of polyoxotantalate species oxides nitrides carbides sulfides tantalum pentoxide ta o is the most important compound from the perspective of applications oxides of tantalum in lower oxidation states are numerous including many defect structures and are lightly studied or poorly characterized tantalates compounds containing tao or tao are numerous lithium tantalate litao adopts a perovskite structure lanthanum tantalate latao contains isolated tao tetrahedra as in the cases of other refractory metals the hardest known compounds of tantalum are nitrides and carbides tantalum carbide tac like the more commonly used tungsten carbide is a hard ceramic that is used in cutting tools tantalum iii nitride is used as a thin film insulator in some microelectronic fabrication processes the best studied chalcogenide is tas a layered semiconductor as seen for other transition metal dichalcogenides a tantalum tellurium alloy forms quasicrystals halides tantalum halides span the oxidation states of and tantalum pentafluoride taf is a white solid with a melting point of c the anion taf is used for its separation from niobium the chloride tacl which exists as a dimer is the main reagent in synthesis of new ta compounds it hydrolyzes readily to an oxychloride the lower halides tax and tax feature ta ta bonds organotantalum compounds organotantalum compounds include pentamethyltantalum mixed alkyltantalum chlorides alkyltantalum hydrides alkylidene complexes as well as cyclopentadienyl derivatives of the same diverse salts and substituted derivatives are known for the hexacarbonyl ta co and related isocyanides occurrence tantalum is estimated to make up about ppm or ppm of the earth s crust by weight there are many species of tantalum minerals only some of which are so far being used by industry as raw materials tantalite a series consisting of tantalite fe tantalite mn and tantalite mg microlite now a group name wodginite euxenite actually euxenite y and polycrase actually polycrase y tantalite fe mn ta o is the most important mineral for tantalum extraction tantalite has the same mineral structure as columbite fe mn ta nb o when there is more tantalum than niobium it is called tantalite and when there is more niobium than tantalum is it called columbite or niobite the high density of tantalite and other tantalum containing minerals makes the use of gravitational separation the best method other minerals include samarskite and fergusonite australia was the main producer of tantalum prior to the s with global advanced metals formerly known as talison minerals being the largest tantalum mining company in that country they operate two mines in western australia greenbushes in the southwest and wodgina in the pilbara region the wodgina mine was reopened in january after mining at the site was suspended in late due to the global financial crisis less than a year after it reopened global advanced metals announced that due to again softening tantalum demand and other factors tantalum mining operations were to cease at the end of february wodgina produces a primary tantalum concentrate which is further upgraded at the greenbushes operation before being sold to customers whereas the large scale producers of niobium are in brazil and canada the ore there also yields a small percentage of tantalum some other countries such as china ethiopia and mozambique mine ores with a higher percentage of tantalum and they produce a significant percentage of the world s output of it tantalum is also produced in thailand and malaysia as a by product of the tin mining there during gravitational separation of the ores from placer deposits not only is cassiterite sno found but a small percentage of tantalite also included the slag from the tin smelters then contains economically useful amounts of tantalum which is leached from the slag world tantalum mine production has undergone an important geographic shift since the start of the st century when production was predominantly from australia and brazil beginning in and through the major sources of tantalum production from mines dramatically shifted to the democratic republic of the congo rwanda and some other african countries future sources of supply of tantalum in order of estimated size are being explored in saudi arabia egypt greenland china mozambique canada australia the united states finland and brazil it is estimated that tantalum resources will run out around based on extraction at current rates demonstrating the need for increased recycling status as a conflict resource tantalum is considered a conflict resource coltan the industrial name for a columbite tantalite mineral from which niobium and tantalum are extracted can also be found in central africa which is why tantalum is being linked to warfare in the democratic republic of the congo formerly zaire according to an october united nations report the smuggling and exportation of coltan has helped fuel the war in the congo a crisis that has resulted in approximately million deaths since making it the world s deadliest documented conflict since world war ii ethical questions have been raised about responsible corporate behavior human rights and endangering wildlife due to the exploitation of resources such as coltan in the armed conflict regions of the congo basin the united states geological survey reports in its yearbook that this region produced a little less than of the world s tantalum output in peaking at in and usgs data published in january indicated that close to of the world s tantalum mine production came from the democratic republic of the congo with another coming from neighboring rwanda and burundi the stated aim of the solutions for hope tantalum project is to source conflict free tantalum from the democratic republic of congo production and fabrication several steps are involved in the extraction of tantalum from tantalite first the mineral is crushed and concentrated by gravity separation this is generally carried out near the mine site refining the refining of tantalum from its ores is one of the more demanding separation processes in industrial metallurgy the chief problem is that tantalum ores contain significant amounts of niobium which has chemical properties almost identical to those of ta a large number of procedures have been developed to address this challenge in modern times the separation is achieved by hydrometallurgy extraction begins with leaching the ore with hydrofluoric acid together with sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid this step allows the tantalum and niobium to be separated from the various non metallic impurities in the rock although ta occurs as various minerals it is conveniently represented as the pentoxide since most oxides of tantalum v behave similarly under these conditions a simplified equation for its extraction is thus ta o hf h taf h ocompletely analogous reactions occur for the niobium component but the hexafluoride is typically predominant under the conditions of the extraction nb o hf h nbf h othese equations are simplified it is suspected that bisulfate hso and chloride compete as ligands for the nb v and ta v ions when sulfuric and hydrochloric acids are used respectively the tantalum and niobium fluoride complexes are then removed from the aqueous solution by liquid liquid extraction into organic solvents such as cyclohexanone octanol and methyl isobutyl ketone this simple procedure allows the removal of most metal containing impurities e g iron manganese titanium zirconium which remain in the aqueous phase in the form of their fluorides and other complexes separation of the tantalum from niobium is then achieved by lowering the ionic strength of the acid mixture which causes the niobium to dissolve in the aqueous phase it is proposed that oxyfluoride h nbof is formed under these conditions subsequent to removal of the niobium the solution of purified h taf is neutralised with aqueous ammonia to precipitate hydrated tantalum oxide as a solid which can be calcined to tantalum pentoxide ta o instead of hydrolysis the h taf can be treated with potassium fluoride to produce potassium heptafluorotantalate h taf kf k taf hfunlike h taf the potassium salt is readily crystallized and handled as a solid k taf can be converted to metallic tantalum by reduction with sodium at approximately c in molten salt k taf na ta naf kfin an older method called the marignac process the mixture of h taf and h nbof was converted to a mixture of k taf and k nbof which was then be separated by fractional crystallization exploiting their different water solubilities electrolysis tantalum can also be refined by electrolysis using a modified version of the hall h roult process instead of requiring the input oxide and output metal to be in liquid form tantalum electrolysis operates on non liquid powdered oxides the initial discovery came in when cambridge university researchers immersed small samples of certain oxides in baths of molten salt and reduced the oxide with electric current the cathode uses powdered metal oxide the anode is made of carbon the molten salt at c f is the electrolyte the first refinery has enough capacity to supply of annual global demand fabrication and metalworking all welding of tantalum must be done in an inert atmosphere of argon or helium in order to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases tantalum is not solderable grinding tantalum is difficult especially so for annealed tantalum in the annealed condition tantalum is extremely ductile and can be readily formed as metal sheets applications electronics the major use for tantalum as the metal powder is in the production of electronic components mainly capacitors and some high power resistors tantalum electrolytic capacitors exploit the tendency of tantalum to form a protective oxide surface layer using tantalum powder pressed into a pellet shape as one plate of the capacitor the oxide as the dielectric and an electrolytic solution or conductive solid as the other plate because the dielectric layer can be very thin thinner than the similar layer in for instance an aluminium electrolytic capacitor a high capacitance can be achieved in a small volume because of the size and weight advantages tantalum capacitors are attractive for portable telephones personal computers automotive electronics and cameras alloys tantalum is also used to produce a variety of alloys that have high melting points strength and ductility alloyed with other metals it is also used in making carbide tools for metalworking equipment and in the production of superalloys for jet engine components chemical process equipment nuclear reactors missile parts heat exchangers tanks and vessels because of its ductility tantalum can be drawn into fine wires or filaments which are used for evaporating metals such as aluminium since it resists attack by body fluids and is nonirritating tantalum is widely used in making surgical instruments and implants for example porous tantalum coatings are used in the construction of orthopedic implants due to tantalum s ability to form a direct bond to hard tissue tantalum is inert against most acids except hydrofluoric acid and hot sulfuric acid and hot alkaline solutions also cause tantalum to corrode this property makes it a useful metal for chemical reaction vessels and pipes for corrosive liquids heat exchanging coils for the steam heating of hydrochloric acid are made from tantalum tantalum was extensively used in the production of ultra high frequency electron tubes for radio transmitters tantalum is capable of capturing oxygen and nitrogen by forming nitrides and oxides and therefore helped to sustain the high vacuum needed for the tubes when used for internal parts such as grids and plates other uses tantalum was used by nasa to shield components of spacecraft such as voyager and voyager from radiation the high melting point and oxidation resistance led to the use of the metal in the production of vacuum furnace parts tantalum is extremely inert and is therefore formed into a variety of corrosion resistant parts such as thermowells valve bodies and tantalum fasteners due to its high density shaped charge and explosively formed penetrator liners have been constructed from tantalum tantalum greatly increases the armor penetration capabilities of a shaped charge due to its high density and high melting point it is also occasionally used in precious watches e g from audemars piguet f p journe hublot montblanc omega and panerai tantalum is also highly bioinert and is used as an orthopedic implant material the high stiffness of tantalum makes it necessary to use it as highly porous foam or scaffold with lower stiffness for hip replacement implants to avoid stress shielding because tantalum is a non ferrous non magnetic metal these implants are considered to be acceptable for patients undergoing mri procedures the oxide is used to make special high refractive index glass for camera lenses environmental issues tantalum receives far less attention in the environmental field than it does in other geosciences upper crust concentration ucc and the nb ta ratio in the upper crust and in minerals are available because these measurements are useful as a geochemical tool the latest value for upper crust concentration is ppm and the nb ta w w ratio stands at little data is available on tantalum concentrations in the different environmental compartments especially in natural waters where reliable estimates of dissolved tantalum concentrations in seawater and freshwaters have not even been produced some values on dissolved concentrations in oceans have been published but they are contradictory values in freshwaters fare little better but in all cases they are probably below ng l since dissolved concentrations in natural waters are well below most current analytical capabilities analysis requires pre concentration procedures that for the moment do not give consistent results and in any case tantalum appears to be present in natural waters mostly as particulate matter rather than dissolved values for concentrations in soils bed sediments and atmospheric aerosols are easier to come by values in soils are close to ppm and thus to ucc values this indicates detrital origin for atmospheric aerosols the values available are scattered and limited when tantalum enrichment is observed it is probably due to loss of more water soluble elements in aerosols in the clouds pollution linked to human use of the element has not been detected tantalum appears to be a very conservative element in biogeochemical terms but its cycling and reactivity are still not fully understood precautions compounds containing tantalum are rarely encountered in the laboratory the metal is highly biocompatible and is used for body implants and coatings therefore attention may be focused on other elements or the physical nature of the chemical compound people can be exposed to tantalum in the workplace by breathing it in skin contact or eye contact the occupational safety and health administration osha has set the legal limit permissible exposure limit for tantalum exposure in the workplace as mg m over an hour workday the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit rel of mg m over an hour workday and a short term limit of mg m at levels of mg m tantalum is immediately dangerous to life and health ,73
Tungsten,W,tungsten or wolfram is a chemical element with the symbol w and atomic number tungsten is a rare metal found naturally on earth almost exclusively as compounds with other elements it was identified as a new element in and first isolated as a metal in its important ores include scheelite and wolframite the latter lending the element its alternate name the free element is remarkable for its robustness especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all known elements barring carbon which sublimes at normal pressure melting at c f k it also has the highest boiling point at c f k its density is grams per cubic centimetre lb cu in comparable with that of uranium and gold and much higher about times than that of lead polycrystalline tungsten is an intrinsically brittle and hard material under standard conditions when uncombined making it difficult to work however pure single crystalline tungsten is more ductile and can be cut with a hard steel hacksaw tungsten occurs in many alloys which have numerous applications including incandescent light bulb filaments x ray tubes electrodes in gas tungsten arc welding superalloys and radiation shielding tungsten s hardness and high density make it suitable for military applications in penetrating projectiles tungsten compounds are often used as industrial catalysts tungsten is the only metal in the third transition series that is known to occur in biomolecules being found in a few species of bacteria and archaea however tungsten interferes with molybdenum and copper metabolism and is somewhat toxic to most forms of animal life characteristics physical properties in its raw form tungsten is a hard steel grey metal that is often brittle and hard to work purified monocrystalline tungsten retains its hardness which exceeds that of many steels and becomes malleable enough that it can be worked easily it is worked by forging drawing or extruding but it is more commonly formed by sintering of all metals in pure form tungsten has the highest melting point c f lowest vapor pressure at temperatures above c f and the highest tensile strength although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten carbon sublimes at atmospheric pressure instead of melting so it has no melting point moreover tungsten s most stable crystal phase does not exhibit any high pressure induced structural transformations for pressures up to at least gigapascals tungsten has the lowest coefficient of thermal expansion of any pure metal the low thermal expansion and high melting point and tensile strength of tungsten originate from strong metallic bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the d electrons alloying small quantities of tungsten with steel greatly increases its toughness tungsten exists in two major crystalline forms and the former has a body centered cubic structure and is the more stable form the structure of the phase is called a cubic it is metastable but can coexist with the phase at ambient conditions owing to non equilibrium synthesis or stabilization by impurities contrary to the phase which crystallizes in isometric grains the form exhibits a columnar habit the phase has one third of the electrical resistivity and a much lower superconducting transition temperature tc relative to the phase ca k vs k mixing the two phases allows obtaining intermediate tc values the tc value can also be raised by alloying tungsten with another metal e g k for w tc such tungsten alloys are sometimes used in low temperature superconducting circuits isotopes naturally occurring tungsten consists of four stable isotopes w w w and w and one very long lived radioisotope w theoretically all five can decay into isotopes of element hafnium by alpha emission but only w has been observed to do so with a half life of years on average this yields about two alpha decays of w per gram of natural tungsten per year this rate is equivalent to a specific activity of roughly micro becquerel per kilogram this rate of decay is orders of magnitude lower than that observed in carbon or potassium as found on earth which likewise contain small amounts of long lived radioactive isotopes bismuth was long thought to be non radioactive but bi its longest lived isotope actually decays with a half life of years or about a factor slower than w however due to naturally occurring bismuth being bi its specific activity is actually higher than that of natural tungsten at milli becquerel per kilogram the other naturally occurring isotopes of tungsten have not been observed to decay constraining their half lives to be at least years if they decay at all another artificial radioisotopes of tungsten have been characterized the most stable of which are w with a half life of days w with a half life of days w with a half life of days w with a half life of days and w with a half life of h all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives of less than hours and most of these have half lives below minutes tungsten also has meta states with the most stable being mw t minutes chemical properties tungsten is a mostly non reactive element it does not react with water is immune to attack by most acids and bases and does not react with oxygen or air at room temperature at elevated temperatures i e when red hot it reacts with oxygen to form the trioxide compound tungsten vi wo it will however react directly with fluorine f at room temperature to form tungsten vi fluoride wf a colorless gas at around c it will react with chlorine or bromine and under certain hot conditions will react with iodine finely divided tungsten is pyrophoric the most common formal oxidation state of tungsten is but it exhibits all oxidation states from to tungsten typically combines with oxygen to form the yellow tungstic oxide wo which dissolves in aqueous alkaline solutions to form tungstate ions wo tungsten carbides w c and wc are produced by heating powdered tungsten with carbon w c is resistant to chemical attack although it reacts strongly with chlorine to form tungsten hexachloride wcl in aqueous solution tungstate gives the heteropoly acids and polyoxometalate anions under neutral and acidic conditions as tungstate is progressively treated with acid it first yields the soluble metastable paratungstate a anion w o which over time converts to the less soluble paratungstate b anion h w o further acidification produces the very soluble metatungstate anion h w o after which equilibrium is reached the metatungstate ion exists as a symmetric cluster of twelve tungsten oxygen octahedra known as the keggin anion many other polyoxometalate anions exist as metastable species the inclusion of a different atom such as phosphorus in place of the two central hydrogens in metatungstate produces a wide variety of heteropoly acids such as phosphotungstic acid h pw o tungsten trioxide can form intercalation compounds with alkali metals these are known as bronzes an example is sodium tungsten bronze in gaseous form tungsten forms the diatomic species w these molecules feature a sextuple bond between tungsten atoms the highest known bond order among stable atoms history in carl wilhelm scheele discovered that a new acid tungstic acid could be made from scheelite at the time called tungsten scheele and torbern bergman suggested that it might be possible to obtain a new metal by reducing this acid in jos and fausto elhuyar found an acid made from wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid later that year at the royal basque society in the town of bergara spain the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten by reduction of this acid with charcoal and they are credited with the discovery of the element they called it wolfram or volfram the strategic value of tungsten came to notice in the early th century british authorities acted in to free the carrock mine from the german owned cumbrian mining company and during world war i restrict german access elsewhere in world war ii tungsten played a more significant role in background political dealings portugal as the main european source of the element was put under pressure from both sides because of its deposits of wolframite ore at panasqueira tungsten s desirable properties such as resistance to high temperatures its hardness and density and its strengthening of alloys made it an important raw material for the arms industry both as a constituent of weapons and equipment and employed in production itself e g in tungsten carbide cutting tools for machining steel now tungsten is used in many more applications such as aircraft motorsport ballast weights darts anti vibration tooling and sporting equipment tungsten is unique amongst the elements in that it has been the subject of patent proceedings in a us court rejected general electric s attempt to patent it overturning u s patent granted in to william d coolidge etymology the name tungsten which means heavy stone in swedish is used in english french and many other languages as the name of the element but not in the nordic countries tungsten was the old swedish name for the mineral scheelite wolfram or volfram is used in most european especially germanic spanish and slavic languages and is derived from the mineral wolframite which is the origin of the chemical symbol w the name wolframite is derived from german wolf rahm wolf soot or wolf cream the name given to tungsten by johan gottschalk wallerius in this in turn derives from latin lupi spuma the name georg agricola used for the element in which translates into english as wolf s froth and is a reference to the large amounts of tin consumed by the mineral during its extraction as though the mineral devoured it like a wolf this naming follows a tradition of colorful names miners from the ore mountains would give various minerals out of a superstition that certain ones that looked as if they contained then known valuable metals but didn t were somehow hexed cobalt c f kobold pitchblende c f german blenden for to blind or to deceive and nickel c f old nick derive their names from the same miner s idiom occurrence tungsten has thus far not been found in nature in its pure form instead tungsten is found mainly in the minerals wolframite and scheelite wolframite is iron manganese tungstate fe mn wo a solid solution of the two minerals ferberite fewo and h bnerite mnwo while scheelite is calcium tungstate cawo other tungsten minerals range in their level of abundance from moderate to very rare and have almost no economic value chemical compounds tungsten forms chemical compounds in oxidation states from ii to vi higher oxidation states always as oxides are relevant to its terrestrial occurrence and its biological roles mid level oxidation states are often associated with metal clusters and very low oxidation states are typically associated with co complexes the chemistries of tungsten and molybdenum show strong similarities to each other as well as contrasts with their lighter congener chromium the relative rarity of tungsten iii for example contrasts with the pervasiveness of the chromium iii compounds the highest oxidation state is seen in tungsten vi oxide wo tungsten vi oxide is soluble in aqueous base forming tungstate wo this oxyanion condenses at lower ph values forming polyoxotungstates the broad range of oxidation states of tungsten is reflected in its various chlorides tungsten ii chloride which exists as the hexamer w cl tungsten iii chloride which exists as the hexamer w cl tungsten iv chloride wcl a black solid which adopts a polymeric structure tungsten v chloride wcl a black solid which adopts a dimeric structure tungsten vi chloride wcl which contrasts with the instability of mocl organotungsten compounds are numerous and also span a range of oxidation states notable examples include the trigonal prismatic w ch and octahedral w co production reserves the world s reserves of tungsten are tonnes they are mostly located in china t canada t russia t vietnam t and bolivia as of china vietnam and russia are the leading suppliers with and tonnes respectively canada had ceased production in late due to the closure of its sole tungsten mine meanwhile vietnam had significantly increased its output in the s owing to the major optimization of its domestic refining operations and overtook russia and bolivia china remains the world s leader not only in production but also in export and consumption of tungsten products tungsten production is gradually increasing outside china because of the rising demand meanwhile its supply by china is strictly regulated by the chinese government which fights illegal mining and excessive pollution originating from mining and refining processes there is a large deposit of tungsten ore on the edge of dartmoor in the united kingdom which was exploited during world war i and world war ii as the hemerdon mine following increases in tungsten prices this mine was reactivated in but ceased activities in within the eu the austrian felbertal scheelite deposit is one of the few producing tungsten mines portugal is one of europe s main tungsten producers with kt of contained tungsten in mineral concentrates from to accounting for roughly of the global production tungsten is considered to be a conflict mineral due to the unethical mining practices observed in the democratic republic of the congo extraction tungsten is extracted from its ores in several stages the ore is eventually converted to tungsten vi oxide wo which is heated with hydrogen or carbon to produce powdered tungsten because of tungsten s high melting point it is not commercially feasible to cast tungsten ingots instead powdered tungsten is mixed with small amounts of powdered nickel or other metals and sintered during the sintering process the nickel diffuses into the tungsten producing an alloy tungsten can also be extracted by hydrogen reduction of wf wf h w hfor pyrolytic decomposition wf w f hr tungsten is not traded as a futures contract and cannot be tracked on exchanges like the london metal exchange the tungsten industry often uses independent pricing references such as argus media or metal bulletin as a basis for contracts the prices are usually quoted for tungsten concentrate or wo applications approximately half of the tungsten is consumed for the production of hard materials namely tungsten carbide with the remaining major use being in alloys and steels less than is used in other chemical compounds because of the high ductile brittle transition temperature of tungsten its products are conventionally manufactured through powder metallurgy spark plasma sintering chemical vapor deposition hot isostatic pressing and thermoplastic routes a more flexible manufacturing alternative is selective laser melting which is a form of d printing and allows creating complex three dimensional shapes industrial tungsten is mainly used in the production of hard materials based on tungsten carbide wc one of the hardest carbides wc is an efficient electrical conductor but w c is less so wc is used to make wear resistant abrasives and carbide cutting tools such as knives drills circular saws dies milling and turning tools used by the metalworking woodworking mining petroleum and construction industries carbide tooling is actually a ceramic metal composite where metallic cobalt acts as a binding matrix material to hold the wc particles in place this type of industrial use accounts for about of current tungsten consumption the jewelry industry makes rings of sintered tungsten carbide tungsten carbide metal composites and also metallic tungsten wc metal composite rings use nickel as the metal matrix in place of cobalt because it takes a higher luster when polished sometimes manufacturers or retailers refer to tungsten carbide as a metal but it is a ceramic because of tungsten carbide s hardness rings made of this material are extremely abrasion resistant and will hold a burnished finish longer than rings made of metallic tungsten tungsten carbide rings are brittle however and may crack under a sharp blow alloys the hardness and heat resistance of tungsten can contribute to useful alloys a good example is high speed steel which can contain as much as tungsten tungsten s high melting point makes tungsten a good material for applications like rocket nozzles for example in the ugm polaris submarine launched ballistic missile tungsten alloys are used in a wide range of applications including the aerospace and automotive industries and radiation shielding superalloys containing tungsten such as hastelloy and stellite are used in turbine blades and wear resistant parts and coatings tungsten s heat resistance makes it useful in arc welding applications when combined with another highly conductive metal such as silver or copper the silver or copper provides the necessary conductivity and the tungsten allows the welding rod to withstand the high temperatures of the arc welding environment permanent magnets quenched martensitic tungsten steel approx to w with to c was used for making hard permanent magnets due to its high remanence and coercivity as noted by john hopkinson as early as the magnetic properties of a metal or an alloy are very sensitive to microstructure for example while the element tungsten is not ferromagnetic but iron is when it is present in steel in these proportions it stabilizes the martensite phase which has greater ferromagnetism than the ferrite iron phase due to its greater resistance to magnetic domain wall motion military tungsten usually alloyed with nickel iron or cobalt to form heavy alloys is used in kinetic energy penetrators as an alternative to depleted uranium in applications where uranium s radioactivity is problematic even in depleted form or where uranium s additional pyrophoric properties are not desired for example in ordinary small arms bullets designed to penetrate body armor similarly tungsten alloys have also been used in shells grenades and missiles to create supersonic shrapnel germany used tungsten during world war ii to produce shells for anti tank gun designs using the gerlich squeeze bore principle to achieve very high muzzle velocity and enhanced armor penetration from comparatively small caliber and light weight field artillery the weapons were highly effective but a shortage of tungsten used in the shell core caused in part by the wolfram crisis limited their use tungsten has also been used in dense inert metal explosives which use it as dense powder to reduce collateral damage while increasing the lethality of explosives within a small radius chemical applications tungsten iv sulfide is a high temperature lubricant and is a component of catalysts for hydrodesulfurization mos is more commonly used for such applications tungsten oxides are used in ceramic glazes and calcium magnesium tungstates are used widely in fluorescent lighting crystal tungstates are used as scintillation detectors in nuclear physics and nuclear medicine other salts that contain tungsten are used in the chemical and tanning industries tungsten oxide wo is incorporated into selective catalytic reduction scr catalysts found in coal fired power plants these catalysts convert nitrogen oxides nox to nitrogen n and water h o using ammonia nh the tungsten oxide helps with the physical strength of the catalyst and extends catalyst life tungsten containing catalysts are promising for epoxidation oxidation and hydrogenolysis reactions tungsten heteropoly acids are key component of multifunctional catalysts tungstates can be used as photocatalyst while the tungsten sulfide as electrocatalyst niche uses applications requiring its high density include weights counterweights ballast keels for yachts tail ballast for commercial aircraft rotor weights for civil and military helicopters and as ballast in race cars for nascar and formula one being slightly less than twice the density tungsten is seen as an alternative albeit more expensive to lead fishing sinkers depleted uranium is also used for these purposes due to similarly high density seventy five kg blocks of tungsten were used as cruise balance mass devices on the entry vehicle portion of the mars science laboratory spacecraft it is an ideal material to use as a dolly for riveting where the mass necessary for good results can be achieved in a compact bar high density alloys of tungsten with nickel copper or iron are used in high quality darts to allow for a smaller diameter and thus tighter groupings or for artificial flys tungsten beads allow the fly to sink rapidly tungsten is also used as a heavy bolt to lower the rate of fire of the swd m sub machine gun from rpm to rpm tungsten has seen use recently in nozzles for d printing the high wear resistance and thermal conductivity of tungsten carbide improves the printing of abrasive filaments some string instrument strings are wound with tungsten tungsten is used as an absorber on the electron telescope on the cosmic ray system of the two voyager spacecraft gold substitution its density similar to that of gold allows tungsten to be used in jewelry as an alternative to gold or platinum metallic tungsten is hypoallergenic and is harder than gold alloys though not as hard as tungsten carbide making it useful for rings that will resist scratching especially in designs with a brushed finish because the density is so similar to that of gold tungsten is only less dense and its price of the order of one thousandth tungsten can also be used in counterfeiting of gold bars such as by plating a tungsten bar with gold which has been observed since the s or taking an existing gold bar drilling holes and replacing the removed gold with tungsten rods the densities are not exactly the same and other properties of gold and tungsten differ but gold plated tungsten will pass superficial tests gold plated tungsten is available commercially from china the main source of tungsten both in jewelry and as bars electronics because it retains its strength at high temperatures and has a high melting point elemental tungsten is used in many high temperature applications such as incandescent light bulb cathode ray tube and vacuum tube filaments heating elements and rocket engine nozzles its high melting point also makes tungsten suitable for aerospace and high temperature uses such as electrical heating and welding applications notably in the gas tungsten arc welding process also called tungsten inert gas tig welding because of its conductive properties and relative chemical inertness tungsten is also used in electrodes and in the emitter tips in electron beam instruments that use field emission guns such as electron microscopes in electronics tungsten is used as an interconnect material in integrated circuits between the silicon dioxide dielectric material and the transistors it is used in metallic films which replace the wiring used in conventional electronics with a coat of tungsten or molybdenum on silicon the electronic structure of tungsten makes it one of the main sources for x ray targets and also for shielding from high energy radiations such as in the radiopharmaceutical industry for shielding radioactive samples of fdg it is also used in gamma imaging as a material from which coded apertures are made due to its excellent shielding properties tungsten powder is used as a filler material in plastic composites which are used as a nontoxic substitute for lead in bullets shot and radiation shields since this element s thermal expansion is similar to borosilicate glass it is used for making glass to metal seals in addition to its high melting point when tungsten is doped with potassium it leads to an increased shape stability compared with non doped tungsten this ensures that the filament does not sag and no undesired changes occur nanowires through top down nanofabrication processes tungsten nanowires have been fabricated and studied since due to a particularly high surface to volume ratio the formation of a surface oxide layer and the single crystal nature of such material the mechanical properties differ fundamentally from those of bulk tungsten such tungsten nanowires have potential applications in nanoelectronics and importantly as ph probes and gas sensors in similarity to silicon nanowires tungsten nanowires are frequently produced from a bulk tungsten precursor followed by a thermal oxidation step to control morphology in terms of length and aspect ratio using the deal grove model it is possible to predict the oxidation kinetics of nanowires fabricated through such thermal oxidation processing fusion power due to its high melting point and good erosion resistance tungsten is a lead candidate for the most exposed sections of the plasma facing inner wall of nuclear fusion reactors it will be used as the plasma facing material of the divertor in the iter reactor and is currently in use in the jet test reactor biological role tungsten at atomic number z is the heaviest element known to be biologically functional it is used by some bacteria and archaea but not in eukaryotes for example enzymes called oxidoreductases use tungsten similarly to molybdenum by using it in a tungsten pterin complex with molybdopterin molybdopterin despite its name does not contain molybdenum but may complex with either molybdenum or tungsten in use by living organisms tungsten using enzymes typically reduce carboxylic acids to aldehydes the tungsten oxidoreductases may also catalyse oxidations the first tungsten requiring enzyme to be discovered also requires selenium and in this case the tungsten selenium pair may function analogously to the molybdenum sulfur pairing of some molybdopterin requiring enzymes one of the enzymes in the oxidoreductase family which sometimes employ tungsten bacterial formate dehydrogenase h is known to use a selenium molybdenum version of molybdopterin acetylene hydratase is an unusual metalloenzyme in that it catalyzes a hydration reaction two reaction mechanisms have been proposed in one of which there is a direct interaction between the tungsten atom and the c c triple bond although a tungsten containing xanthine dehydrogenase from bacteria has been found to contain tungsten molydopterin and also non protein bound selenium a tungsten selenium molybdopterin complex has not been definitively described in soil tungsten metal oxidizes to the tungstate anion it can be selectively or non selectively imported by some prokaryotic organisms and may substitute for molybdate in certain enzymes its effect on the action of these enzymes is in some cases inhibitory and in others positive the soil s chemistry determines how the tungsten polymerizes alkaline soils cause monomeric tungstates acidic soils cause polymeric tungstates sodium tungstate and lead have been studied for their effect on earthworms lead was found to be lethal at low levels and sodium tungstate was much less toxic but the tungstate completely inhibited their reproductive ability tungsten has been studied as a biological copper metabolic antagonist in a role similar to the action of molybdenum it has been found that tetrathiotungstate salts may be used as biological copper chelation chemicals similar to the tetrathiomolybdates in archaea tungsten is essential for some archaea the following tungsten utilizing enzymes are known aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase aor in thermococcus strain es formaldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase for in thermococcus litoralis glyceraldehyde phosphate ferredoxin oxidoreductase gapor in pyrococcus furiosusa wtp system is known to selectively transport tungsten in archaea wtpa is tungsten binding protein of abc family of transporters wptb is a permease wtpc is atpase health factors because tungsten is a rare metal and its compounds are generally inert the effects of tungsten on the environment are limited the abundance of tungsten in the earth s crust is thought to be about parts per million it is one of the rarer elements it was at first believed to be relatively inert and an only slightly toxic metal but beginning in the year the risk presented by tungsten alloys its dusts and particulates to induce cancer and several other adverse effects in animals as well as humans has been highlighted from in vitro and in vivo experiments the median lethal dose ld depends strongly on the animal and the method of administration and varies between mg kg intravenous rabbits and mg kg tungsten metal powder intraperitoneal rats people can be exposed to tungsten in the workplace by breathing it in swallowing it skin contact and eye contact the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit rel of mg m over an hour workday and a short term limit of mg m ,74

single use for the element the second most important use is as a catalyst rhenium is an excellent catalyst for hydrogenation and isomerization and is used for example in catalytic reforming of naphtha for use in gasoline rheniforming process because of the low availability relative to demand rhenium is expensive with price reaching an all time high in of us per kilogram us per pound due to increases in rhenium recycling and a drop in demand for rhenium in catalysts the price of rhenium had dropped to us per kilogram us per pound as of july history rhenium latin rhenus meaning rhine was the last discovered of the elements that have a stable isotope other new elements discovered in nature since then such as francium are radioactive the existence of a yet undiscovered element at this position in the periodic table had been first predicted by dmitri mendeleev other calculated information was obtained by henry moseley in in japanese chemist masataka ogawa announced that he had discovered the rd element and named it nipponium np after japan nippon in japanese however recent analysis indicated the presence of rhenium element not element although this reinterpretation has been questioned by eric scerri the symbol np was later used for the element neptunium and the name nihonium also named after japan along with symbol nh was later used for element element was also discovered by a team of japanese scientists and was named in respectful homage to ogawa s work rhenium is generally considered to have been discovered by walter noddack ida noddack and otto berg in germany in they reported that they had detected the element in platinum ore and in the mineral columbite they also found rhenium in gadolinite and molybdenite in they were able to extract g of the element by processing kg of molybdenite it was estimated in that of the rhenium metal in the united states was used for research and the development of refractory metal alloys it took several years from that point before the superalloys became widely used characteristics rhenium is a silvery white metal with one of the highest melting points of all elements exceeded by only tungsten and carbon it also has one of the highest boiling points of all elements and the highest among stable elements it is also one of the densest exceeded only by platinum iridium and osmium rhenium has a hexagonal close packed crystal structure with lattice parameters a pm and c pm its usual commercial form is a powder but this element can be consolidated by pressing and sintering in a vacuum or hydrogen

nevertheless occurs in minority abundance a situation found only in two other elements indium and tellurium naturally occurring rhenium is only re and re which is unstable but has a very long half life years a kilogram of natural rhenium emits mbq of radiation due to the presence of this isotope this lifetime can be greatly affected by the charge state of the rhenium atom the beta decay of re is used for rhenium osmium dating of ores the available energy for this beta decay kev is one of the lowest known among all radionuclides the isotope rhenium m is notable as being one of the longest

early from per kg in to over in february the metal form is prepared by reducing ammonium perrhenate with hydrogen at high temperatures nh reo h re h o nh there are technologies for the associated extraction of rhenium from productive solutions of underground leaching of uranium ores applications rhenium is added to high temperature superalloys that are used to make jet engine parts using of the worldwide rhenium production another major application is in platinum rhenium catalysts which are primarily used in making lead free high octane gasoline alloys the nickel based superalloys have improved creep strength with the addition of rhenium the alloys normally contain or of rhenium second generation alloys contain these alloys were used in the engines for the f and f whereas the newer single crystal third generation alloys contain of rhenium they are used in the f and f engines rhenium is also used in the superalloys such as cmsx nd gen and cmsx rd gen that are used in industrial gas turbine engines like the ge fa rhenium can cause superalloys to become microstructurally unstable forming undesirable topologically close packed tcp phases in th and th generation superalloys ruthenium is used to avoid this effect among others the new superalloys are epm with ru and tms with ru as well as tms and tms for the consumption is given as for general electric rolls royce plc and pratt whitney all for superalloys whereas the use for catalysts only accounts for and the remaining applications use in of rhenium consumption in the united states was in alloys the rising demand for military jet engines and the constant supply made it necessary to develop superalloys with a lower rhenium content for example the newer cfm international cfm high pressure turbine hpt blades will use rene n with a rhenium content of instead of rene n with rhenium improves the properties of tungsten tungsten rhenium alloys are more ductile at low temperature allowing them to be more easily machined the high temperature stability is also improved the effect increases with the rhenium concentration and therefore tungsten alloys are produced with up to of re which is the solubility limit tungsten rhenium wire was originally created in efforts to develop a wire that was more ductile after recrystallization this allows the wire to meet specific performance objectives including superior vibration resistance improved ductility and higher resistivity one application for the tungsten rhenium alloys is x ray sources the high melting point of both elements together with their high atomic mass makes them stable against the prolonged electron impact rhenium tungsten alloys are also applied as thermocouples to measure temperatures up to c the high temperature stability low vapor pressure good wear resistance and ability to withstand arc corrosion of rhenium are useful in self cleaning electrical contacts in particular the discharge that occurs during electrical switching oxidizes the contacts however rhenium oxide re o is volatile sublimes at c and therefore is removed during the discharge rhenium has a high melting point and a low vapor pressure similar to tantalum and tungsten therefore rhenium filaments exhibit a higher stability if the filament is operated not in vacuum but in oxygen containing atmosphere those filaments are widely used in mass spectrometers ion gauges and photoflash lamps in photography catalysts rhenium in the form of rhenium platinum alloy is used as catalyst for catalytic reforming which is a chemical process to convert petroleum refinery naphthas with low octane ratings into high octane liquid products worldwide of catalysts used for this process contain rhenium the olefin metathesis is the other reaction for which rhenium is used as catalyst normally re o on alumina is used for this process rhenium catalysts are very resistant to chemical poisoning from nitrogen sulfur and phosphorus and so are used in certain kinds of hydrogenation reactions other uses the isotopes re and re are radioactive and are used for treatment of liver cancer they both have similar penetration depth in tissue mm for re and mm for re but re has advantage of longer lifetime hours vs hours re is also being used experimentally in a novel treatment of pancreatic cancer where it is delivered by means of the bacterium listeria monocytogenes the re isotope is also used for the rhenium sct skin cancer therapy the treatment uses the isotope s properties as a beta emitter for brachytherapy in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin related by periodic trends rhenium has a similar chemistry to that of technetium work done to label rhenium onto target compounds can often be translated to technetium this is useful for radiopharmacy where it is difficult to work with technetium especially the technetium m isotope used in medicine due to its expense and short half life precautions very little is known about the toxicity of rhenium and its compounds because they are used in very small amounts soluble salts such as the rhenium halides or perrhenates could be hazardous due to elements other than rhenium or due to rhenium itself only a few compounds of rhenium have been tested for their acute toxicity two examples are potassium perrhenate and rhenium trichloride which were injected as a solution into rats the perrhenate had an ld value of mg kg after seven days this is very low toxicity similar to that of table salt and the rhenium trichloride showed ld of mg kg ,75
Osmium,Os,osmium from greek osme smell is a chemical element with the symbol os and atomic number it is a hard brittle bluish white transition metal in the platinum group that is found as a trace element in alloys mostly in platinum ores osmium is the densest naturally occurring element when experimentally measured using x ray crystallography it has a density of g cm manufacturers use its alloys with platinum iridium and other platinum group metals to make fountain pen nib tipping electrical contacts and in other applications that require extreme durability and hardness osmium is among the rarest elements in the earth s crust making up only parts per trillion ppt it is estimated to be about parts per billion in the universe and is therefore the rarest precious metal characteristics physical properties osmium has a blue gray tint and is the densest stable element it is approximately twice as dense as lead and narrowly denser than iridium calculations of density from the x ray diffraction data may produce the most reliable data for these elements giving a value of g cm for osmium slightly denser than the g cm of iridium both metals are nearly times as dense as water and times as dense as gold osmium is a hard but brittle metal that remains lustrous even at high temperatures it has a very low compressibility correspondingly its bulk modulus is extremely high reported between and gpa which rivals that of diamond gpa the hardness of osmium is moderately high at gpa because of its hardness brittleness low vapor pressure the lowest of the platinum group metals and very high melting point the fourth highest of all elements after carbon tungsten and rhenium solid osmium is difficult to machine form or work chemical properties osmium forms compounds with oxidation states ranging from to the most common oxidation states are and the oxidation state is notable for being the highest attained by any chemical element aside from iridium s and is encountered only in xenon ruthenium hassium iridium and plutonium the oxidation states and represented by the two reactive compounds na os co and na os co are used in the synthesis of osmium cluster compounds the most common compound exhibiting the oxidation state is osmium tetroxide this toxic compound is formed when powdered osmium is exposed to air it is a very volatile water soluble pale yellow crystalline solid with a strong smell osmium powder has the characteristic smell of osmium tetroxide osmium tetroxide forms red osmates oso oh upon reaction with a base with ammonia it forms the nitrido osmates oso n osmium tetroxide boils at c and is a powerful oxidizing agent by contrast osmium dioxide oso is black non volatile and much less reactive and toxic only two osmium compounds have major applications osmium tetroxide for staining tissue in electron microscopy and for the oxidation of alkenes in organic synthesis and the non volatile osmates for organic oxidation reactions osmium pentafluoride osf is known but osmium trifluoride osf has not yet been synthesized the lower oxidation states are stabilized by the larger halogens so that the trichloride tribromide triiodide and even diiodide are known the oxidation state is known only for osmium monoiodide osi whereas several carbonyl complexes of osmium such as triosmium dodecacarbonyl os co represent oxidation state in general the lower oxidation states of osmium are stabilized by ligands that are good donors such as amines and acceptors heterocycles containing nitrogen the higher oxidation states are stabilized by strong and donors such as o and n despite its broad range of compounds in numerous oxidation states osmium in bulk form at ordinary temperatures and pressures resists attack by all acids including aqua regia but is attacked by fused alkalis hot nitric acid and hot aqua regia isotopes osmium has seven naturally occurring isotopes five of which are stable os os os os and most abundant os os undergoes alpha decay with such a long half life years approximately times the age of the universe that for practical purposes it can be considered stable os is also known to undergo alpha decay with a half life of years alpha decay is predicted for all the other naturally occurring isotopes but this has never been observed presumably due to very long half lives it is predicted that os and os can undergo double beta decay but this radioactivity has not been observed yet os is the descendant of re half life years and is used extensively in dating terrestrial as well as meteoric rocks see rhenium osmium dating it has also been used to measure the intensity of continental weathering over geologic time and to fix minimum ages for stabilization of the mantle roots of continental cratons this decay is a reason why rhenium rich minerals are abnormally rich in os however the most notable application of osmium isotopes in geology has been in conjunction with the abundance of iridium to characterise the layer of shocked quartz along the cretaceous paleogene boundary that marks the extinction of the non avian dinosaurs million years ago history osmium was discovered in by smithson tennant and william hyde wollaston in london england the discovery of osmium is intertwined with that of platinum and the other metals of the platinum group platinum reached europe as platina small silver first encountered in the late th century in silver mines around the choc department in colombia the discovery that this metal was not an alloy but a distinct new element was published in chemists who studied platinum dissolved it in aqua regia a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids to create soluble salts they always observed a small amount of a dark insoluble residue joseph louis proust thought that the residue was graphite victor collet descotils antoine fran ois comte de fourcroy and louis nicolas vauquelin also observed iridium in the black platinum residue in but did not obtain enough material for further experiments later the two french chemists fourcroy and vauquelin identified a metal in a platinum residue they called pt ne in smithson tennant analyzed the insoluble residue and concluded that it must contain a new metal vauquelin treated the powder alternately with alkali and acids and obtained a volatile new oxide which he believed was of this new metal which he named ptene from the greek word pt nos for winged however tennant who had the advantage of a much larger amount of residue continued his research and identified two previously undiscovered elements in the black residue iridium and osmium he obtained a yellow solution probably of cis os oh o by reactions with sodium hydroxide at red heat after acidification he was able to distill the formed oso he named it osmium after greek osme meaning a smell because of the ashy and smoky smell of the volatile osmium tetroxide discovery of the new elements was documented in a letter to the royal society on june uranium and osmium were early successful catalysts in the haber process the nitrogen fixation reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia giving enough yield to make the process economically successful at the time a group at basf led by carl bosch bought most of the world s supply of osmium to use as a catalyst shortly thereafter in cheaper catalysts based on iron and iron oxides were introduced by the same group for the first pilot plants removing the need for the expensive and rare osmium nowadays osmium is obtained primarily from the processing of platinum and nickel ores occurrence osmium is the least abundant stable element in earth s crust with an average mass fraction of parts per trillion in the continental crust osmium is found in nature as an uncombined element or in natural alloys especially the iridium osmium alloys osmiridium iridium rich and iridosmium osmium rich in nickel and copper deposits the platinum group metals occur as sulfides i e pt pd s tellurides e g ptbite antimonides e g pdsb and arsenides e g ptas in all these compounds platinum is exchanged by a small amount of iridium and osmium as with all of the platinum group metals osmium can be found naturally in alloys with nickel or copper within earth s crust osmium like iridium is found at highest concentrations in three types of geologic structure igneous deposits crustal intrusions from below impact craters and deposits reworked from one of the former structures the largest known primary reserves are in the bushveld igneous complex in south africa though the large copper nickel deposits near norilsk in russia and the sudbury basin in canada are also significant sources of osmium smaller reserves can be found in the united states the alluvial deposits used by pre columbian people in the choc department colombia are still a source for platinum group metals the second large alluvial deposit was found in the ural mountains russia which is still mined production osmium is obtained commercially as a by product from nickel and copper mining and processing during electrorefining of copper and nickel noble metals such as silver gold and the platinum group metals together with non metallic elements such as selenium and tellurium settle to the bottom of the cell as anode mud which forms the starting material for their extraction separating the metals requires that they first be brought into solution several methods can achieve this depending on the separation process and the composition of the mixture two representative methods are fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in aqua regia and dissolution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid osmium ruthenium rhodium and iridium can be separated from platinum gold and base metals by their insolubility in aqua regia leaving a solid residue rhodium can be separated from the residue by treatment with molten sodium bisulfate the insoluble residue containing ruthenium osmium and iridium is treated with sodium oxide in which ir is insoluble producing water soluble ruthenium and osmium salts after oxidation to the volatile oxides ruo is separated from oso by precipitation of nh rucl with ammonium chloride after it is dissolved osmium is separated from the other platinum group metals by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile osmium tetroxide the first method is similar to the procedure used by tennant and wollaston both methods are suitable for industrial scale production in either case the product is reduced using hydrogen yielding the metal as a powder or sponge that can be treated using powder metallurgy techniques neither the producers nor the united states geological survey published any production amounts for osmium in estimations of the united states production of osmium as a byproduct of copper refining was troy ounces kg between and annual us imports of osmium ranged from less than kg to kg averaging kg year one another method for producing osmium is from rhenium rh which occurs in nature could absorb a neutron to become rh this has a short half life of approximately hours the nucleus converts to os which occurs in nature applications because of the volatility and extreme toxicity of its oxide osmium is rarely used in its pure state but is instead often alloyed with other metals for high wear applications osmium alloys such as osmiridium are very hard and along with other platinum group metals are used in the tips of fountain pens instrument pivots and electrical contacts as they can resist wear from frequent operation they were also used for the tips of phonograph styli during the late rpm and early lp and record era circa to osmium alloy tips were significantly more durable than steel and chromium needle points but wore out far more rapidly than competing and costlier sapphire and diamond tips so they were discontinued osmium tetroxide has been used in fingerprint detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy as a strong oxidant it cross links lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them because osmium atoms are extremely electron dense osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy tem studies of biological materials those carbon materials otherwise have very weak tem contrast another osmium compound osmium ferricyanide osfecn exhibits similar fixing and staining action the tetroxide and its derivative potassium osmate are important oxidants in organic synthesis for the sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation which uses osmate for the conversion of a double bond into a vicinal diol karl barry sharpless was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in oso is very expensive for this use so kmno is often used instead even though the yields are less for this cheaper chemical reagent in the austrian chemist auer von welsbach developed the oslamp with a filament made of osmium which he introduced commercially in after only a few years osmium was replaced by tungsten which is more abundant and thus cheaper and more stable tungsten has the highest melting point among all metals and its use in light bulbs increases the luminous efficacy and life of incandescent lamps the light bulb manufacturer osram founded in when three german companies auer gesellschaft aeg and siemens halske combined their lamp production facilities derived its name from the elements of osmium and wolfram the latter is german for tungsten like palladium powdered osmium effectively absorbs hydrogen atoms this could make osmium a potential candidate for a metal hydride battery electrode however osmium is expensive and would react with potassium hydroxide the most common battery electrolyte osmium has high reflectivity in the ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum for example at osmium has a reflectivity twice that of gold this high reflectivity is desirable in space based uv spectrometers which have reduced mirror sizes due to space limitations osmium coated mirrors were flown in several space missions aboard the space shuttle but it soon became clear that the oxygen radicals in low earth orbit are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the osmium layer the only known clinical use of osmium is synovectomy in arthritic patients in scandinavia it involves the local administration of osmium tetroxide oso which is a highly toxic compound the lack of reports of long term side effects suggest that osmium itself can be biocompatible though this depends on the osmium compound administered in osmium vi and osmium ii compounds were reported to show anticancer activity in vivo this indicated a promising future for using osmium compounds as anticancer drugs precautions metallic osmium is harmless in its metallic state but finely divided metallic osmium is pyrophoric and reacts with oxygen at room temperature forming volatile osmium tetroxide because all osmium metal slowly oxidizes in air with the exception of crystallized osmium and various alloys the degree of hazard comes from its surface area some osmium compounds are also converted to the tetroxide if oxygen is present this makes osmium tetroxide the main source of contact with the environment osmium tetroxide is highly volatile and penetrates skin readily and is very toxic by inhalation ingestion and skin contact airborne low concentrations of osmium tetroxide vapor can cause lung congestion and skin or eye damage and should therefore be used in a fume hood osmium tetroxide is rapidly reduced to relatively inert compounds by e g ascorbic acid or polyunsaturated vegetable oils such as corn oil price osmium like other precious metals is measured by troy weight and grams the market price of osmium has not changed in decades primarily because little change has occurred in supply and demand in addition to being scarce osmium is difficult to work with has few uses and is a challenge to store safely because of the metal s toxic gas made when oxygenated while the price of per troy ounce has remained steady since the s inflation since that time has led to the metal losing about one third of its value in the two decades prior to ,76
Iridium,Ir,iridium is a chemical element with the symbol ir and atomic number a very hard brittle silvery white transition metal of the platinum group it is considered the second densest naturally occurring metal after osmium with a density of g cm lb cu in as defined by experimental x ray crystallography it is one of the most corrosion resistant metals even at temperatures as high as c f however corrosion resistance is not quantifiable in absolute terms although only certain molten salts and halogens are corrosive to solid iridium finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable whereas gold dust is not flammable but can be attacked by substances that iridium resists such as aqua regia iridium was discovered in among insoluble impurities in natural platinum smithson tennant the primary discoverer named it after the greek goddess iris personification of the rainbow because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts iridium is one of the rarest elements in earth s crust with annual production and consumption of only tonnes thousand pounds ir and ir are the only two naturally occurring isotopes of iridium as well as the only stable isotopes the latter is the more abundant the most important iridium compounds in use are the salts and acids it forms with chlorine though iridium also forms a number of organometallic compounds used in industrial catalysis and in research iridium metal is employed when high corrosion resistance at high temperatures is needed as in high performance spark plugs crucibles for recrystallization of semiconductors at high temperatures and electrodes for the production of chlorine in the chloralkali process iridium radioisotopes are used in some radioisotope thermoelectric generators iridium is found in meteorites in much higher abundance than in the earth s crust for this reason the unusually high abundance of iridium in the clay layer at the cretaceous paleogene boundary gave rise to the alvarez hypothesis that the impact of a massive extraterrestrial object caused the extinction of dinosaurs and many other species million years ago now known to be produced by the impact that formed the chicxulub crater similarly an iridium anomaly in core samples from the pacific ocean suggested the eltanin impact of about million years ago it is thought that the total amount of iridium in the planet earth is much higher than that observed in crustal rocks but as with other platinum group metals the high density and tendency of iridium to bond with iron caused most iridium to descend below the crust when the planet was young and still molten characteristics physical properties a member of the platinum group metals iridium is white resembling platinum but with a slight yellowish cast because of its hardness brittleness and very high melting point solid iridium is difficult to machine form or work thus powder metallurgy is commonly employed instead it is the only metal to maintain good mechanical properties in air at temperatures above c f it has the th highest boiling point among all elements and becomes a superconductor at temperatures below k c f iridium s modulus of elasticity is the second highest among the metals being surpassed only by osmium this together with a high shear modulus and a very low figure for poisson s ratio the relationship of longitudinal to lateral strain indicate the high degree of stiffness and resistance to deformation that have rendered its fabrication into useful components a matter of great difficulty despite these limitations and iridium s high cost a number of applications have developed where mechanical strength is an essential factor in some of the extremely severe conditions encountered in modern technology the measured density of iridium is only slightly lower by about than that of osmium the densest metal known some ambiguity occurred regarding which of the two elements was denser due to the small size of the difference in density and difficulties in measuring it accurately but with increased accuracy in factors used for calculating density x ray crystallographic data yielded densities of g cm lb cu in for iridium and g cm lb cu in for osmium iridium is extremely brittle to the point of being hard to weld because the heat affected zone cracks but it can be made more ductile by addition of small quantities of titanium and zirconium of each apparently works well the vickers hardness of pure platinum is hv whereas platinum with of iridium can reach over hv chemical properties iridium is the most corrosion resistant metal known it is not attacked by acids including aqua regia in the presence of oxygen it reacts with cyanide salts traditional oxidants also react including the halogens and oxygen at higher temperatures iridium also reacts directly with sulfur at atmospheric pressure to yield iridium disulfide isotopes iridium has two naturally occurring stable isotopes ir and ir with natural abundances of and respectively at least radioisotopes have also been synthesized ranging in mass number from to ir which falls between the two stable isotopes is the most stable radioisotope with a half life of days and finds application in brachytherapy and in industrial radiography particularly for nondestructive testing of welds in steel in the oil and gas industries iridium sources have been involved in a number of radiological accidents three other isotopes have half lives of at least a day ir ir and ir isotopes with masses below decay by some combination of decay decay and rare proton emission with the exception of ir which decays by electron capture synthetic isotopes heavier than decay by decay although ir also has a minor electron capture decay path all known isotopes of iridium were discovered between and with the most recent discoveries being ir at least metastable isomers have been characterized ranging in mass number from to the most stable of these is m ir which decays by isomeric transition with a half life of years making it more stable than any of iridium s synthetic isotopes in their ground states the least stable isomer is m ir with a half life of only s the isotope ir was the first one of any element to be shown to present a m ssbauer effect this renders it useful for m ssbauer spectroscopy for research in physics chemistry biochemistry metallurgy and mineralogy chemistry oxidation states iridium forms compounds in oxidation states between and but the most common oxidation states are and well characterized compounds containing iridium in the oxidation state include irf and the oxides sr mgiro and sr cairo iridium viii oxide iro was generated under matrix isolation conditions at k in argon the highest oxidation state which is also the highest recorded for any element is found in gaseous iro binary compounds iridium does not form binary hydrides only one binary oxide is well characterized iridium dioxide iro it is a blue black solid that adopts the fluorite structure a sesquioxide ir o has been described as a blue black powder which is oxidized to iro by hno the corresponding disulfides diselenides sesquisulfides and sesquiselenides are known as well as irs binary trihalides irx are known for all of the halogens for oxidation states and above only the tetrafluoride pentafluoride and hexafluoride are known iridium hexafluoride irf is a volatile yellow solid composed of octahedral molecules it decomposes in water and is reduced to irf iridium pentafluoride is also a strong oxidant but it is a tetramer ir f formed by four corner sharing octahedra complexes the coordination complexes of iridium are extensive iridium in its complexes is always low spin ir iii and ir iv generally form octahedral complexes polyhydride complexes are known for the and oxidation states one example is irh pipr the ternary hydride mg ir h is believed to contain both the irh and the electron irh anion iridium also oxyanions with oxidation states and k iro and kiro can be prepared from the reaction of potassium oxide or potassium superoxide with iridium at high temperatures such solids are not soluble in conventional solvents as for many elements the chlorides are key complexes hexachloroiridic iv acid h ircl and its ammonium salt are the most common iridium compounds from an industrial and preparative perspectives they are intermediates in the purification of iridium and used as precursors for most other iridium compounds as well as in the preparation of anode coatings the ircl ion has an intense dark brown color and can be readily reduced to the lighter colored ircl and vice versa iridium trichloride ircl which can be obtained in anhydrous form from direct oxidation of iridium powder by chlorine at c or in hydrated form by dissolving ir o in hydrochloric acid is often used as a starting material for the synthesis of other ir iii compounds another compound used as a starting material is ammonium hexachloroiridate iii nh ircl in the presence of air iridium metal dissolves in molten alkali metal cyanides to produce the ir cn hexacyanoiridate ion organoiridium chemistry organoiridium compounds contain iridium carbon bonds early studies identified the very stable tetrairidium dodecacarbonyl ir co in this compound each of the iridium atoms is bonded to the other three forming a tetrahedral cluster the discovery of vaska s complex ircl co p c h opened the door for oxidative addition reactions a process fundamental to useful reactions for example crabtree s catalyst a homogeneous catalyst for hydrogenation reactions iridium complexes played a pivotal role in the development of carbon hydrogen bond activation c h activation which promises to allow functionalization of hydrocarbons which are traditionally regarded as unreactive history platinum group the discovery of iridium is intertwined with that of platinum and the other metals of the platinum group the first european reference to platinum appears in in the writings of the italian humanist julius caesar scaliger as a description of an unknown noble metal found between dari n and mexico which no fire nor any spanish artifice has yet been able to liquefy from their first encounters with platinum the spanish generally saw the metal as a kind of impurity in gold and it was treated as such it was often simply thrown away and there was an official decree forbidding the adulteration of gold with platinum impurities in antonio de ulloa and jorge juan y santacilia saw native americans mining platinum while the spaniards were travelling through colombia and peru for eight years ulloa and juan found mines with the whitish metal nuggets and took them home to spain antonio de ulloa returned to spain and established the first mineralogy lab in spain and was the first to systematically study platinum which was in his historical account of the expedition included a description of platinum as being neither separable nor calcinable ulloa also anticipated the discovery of platinum mines after publishing the report in ulloa did not continue to investigate the new metal in he was sent to superintend mercury mining operations in huancavelica in charles wood a british metallurgist found various samples of colombian platinum in jamaica which he sent to william brownrigg for further investigation in after studying the platinum sent to him by wood brownrigg presented a detailed account of the metal to the royal society stating that he had seen no mention of it in any previous accounts of known minerals brownrigg also made note of platinum s extremely high melting point and refractoriness toward borax other chemists across europe soon began studying platinum including andreas sigismund marggraf torbern bergman j ns jakob berzelius william lewis and pierre macquer in henrik scheffer published a detailed scientific description of the metal which he referred to as white gold including an account of how he succeeded in fusing platinum ore with the aid of arsenic scheffer described platinum as being less pliable than gold but with similar resistance to corrosion discovery chemists who studied platinum dissolved it in aqua regia a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids to create soluble salts they always observed a small amount of a dark insoluble residue joseph louis proust thought that the residue was graphite the french chemists victor collet descotils antoine fran ois comte de fourcroy and louis nicolas vauquelin also observed the black residue in but did not obtain enough for further experiments in british scientist smithson tennant analyzed the insoluble residue and concluded that it must contain a new metal vauquelin treated the powder alternately with alkali and acids and obtained a volatile new oxide which he believed to be of this new metal which he named ptene from the greek word pt n s winged tennant who had the advantage of a much greater amount of residue continued his research and identified the two previously undiscovered elements in the black residue iridium and osmium he obtained dark red crystals probably of na ircl nh o by a sequence of reactions with sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid he named iridium after iris the greek winged goddess of the rainbow and the messenger of the olympian gods because many of the salts he obtained were strongly colored discovery of the new elements was documented in a letter to the royal society on june metalworking and applications british scientist john george children was the first to melt a sample of iridium in with the aid of the greatest galvanic battery that has ever been constructed at that time the first to obtain high purity iridium was robert hare in he found it had a density of around g cm lb cu in and noted the metal is nearly immalleable and very hard the first melting in appreciable quantity was done by henri sainte claire deville and jules henri debray in they required burning more than litres us gal of pure o and h gas for each kilogram lb of iridium these extreme difficulties in melting the metal limited the possibilities for handling iridium john isaac hawkins was looking to obtain a fine and hard point for fountain pen nibs and in managed to create an iridium pointed gold pen in john holland and william lofland dudley were able to melt iridium by adding phosphorus and patented the process in the united states british company johnson matthey later stated they had been using a similar process since and had already presented fused iridium at a number of world fairs the first use of an alloy of iridium with ruthenium in thermocouples was made by otto feussner in these allowed for the measurement of high temperatures in air up to c f in munich germany in rudolf m ssbauer in what has been called one of the landmark experiments in twentieth century physics discovered the resonant and recoil free emission and absorption of gamma rays by atoms in a solid metal sample containing only ir this phenomenon known as the m ssbauer effect resulted in the awarding of the nobel prize in physics in at the age just three years after he published his discovery occurrence along with all elements having atomic weights higher than that of iron iridium is only naturally formed by the r process rapid neutron capture in supernovae and neutron star mergers iridium is one of the nine least abundant stable elements in earth s crust having an average mass fraction of ppm in crustal rock platinum is times more abundant gold is times more abundant and silver and mercury are times more abundant tellurium is about as abundant as iridium in contrast to its low abundance in crustal rock iridium is relatively common in meteorites with concentrations of ppm or more the overall concentration of iridium on earth is thought to be much higher than what is observed in crustal rocks but because of the density and siderophilic iron loving character of iridium it descended below the crust and into earth s core when the planet was still molten iridium is found in nature as an uncombined element or in natural alloys especially the iridium osmium alloys osmiridium osmium rich and iridosmium iridium rich in the nickel and copper deposits the platinum group metals occur as sulfides i e pt pd s tellurides i e ptbite antimonides pdsb and arsenides i e ptas in all of these compounds platinum is exchanged by a small amount of iridium and osmium as with all of the platinum group metals iridium can be found naturally in alloys with raw nickel or raw copper a number of iridium dominant minerals with iridium as the species forming element are known they are exceedingly rare and often represent the iridium analogues of the above given ones the examples are irarsite and cuproiridsite to mention some within earth s crust iridium is found at highest concentrations in three types of geologic structure igneous deposits crustal intrusions from below impact craters and deposits reworked from one of the former structures the largest known primary reserves are in the bushveld igneous complex in south africa near the largest known impact structure the vredefort impact structure though the large copper nickel deposits near norilsk in russia and the sudbury basin also an impact crater in canada are also significant sources of iridium smaller reserves are found in the united states iridium is also found in secondary deposits combined with platinum and other platinum group metals in alluvial deposits the alluvial deposits used by pre columbian people in the choc department of colombia are still a source for platinum group metals as of world reserves have not been estimated marine oceanography iridium is found within marine organisms sediments and the water column the abundance of iridium in seawater and organisms is relatively low as it does not readily form chloride complexes the abundance in organisms is about parts per trillion or about five orders of magnitude less than in sedimentary rocks at the cretaceous paleogene k t boundary the concentration of iridium in seawater and marine sediment is sensitive to marine oxygenation seawater temperature and various geological and biological processes iridium in sediments can come from cosmic dust volcanoes precipitation from seawater microbial processes or hydrothermal vents and its abundance can be strongly indicative of the source it tends to associate with other ferrous metals in manganese nodules iridium is one of the characteristic elements of extraterrestrial rocks and along with osmium can be used as a tracer element for meteoritic material in sediment for example core samples from the pacific ocean with elevated iridium levels suggested the eltanin impact of about million years ago some of the mass extinctions such as the cretaceous extinction can be identified by anomalously high concentrations of iridium in sediment and these can be linked to major asteroid impacts cretaceous paleogene boundary presence the cretaceous paleogene boundary of million years ago marking the temporal border between the cretaceous and paleogene periods of geological time was identified by a thin stratum of iridium rich clay a team led by luis alvarez proposed in an extraterrestrial origin for this iridium attributing it to an asteroid or comet impact their theory known as the alvarez hypothesis is now widely accepted to explain the extinction of the non avian dinosaurs a large buried impact crater structure with an estimated age of about million years was later identified under what is now the yucat n peninsula the chicxulub crater dewey m mclean and others argue that the iridium may have been of volcanic origin instead because earth s core is rich in iridium and active volcanoes such as piton de la fournaise in the island of r union are still releasing iridium production in worldwide production of iridium totaled kilograms lb in mid april iridium reached a price of us per troy ounce on metals daily a precious metals commodity listing the price dropped to us for iridium is also obtained commercially as a by product from nickel and copper mining and processing during electrorefining of copper and nickel noble metals such as silver gold and the platinum group metals as well as selenium and tellurium settle to the bottom of the cell as anode mud which forms the starting point for their extraction to separate the metals they must first be brought into solution two methods for rendering ir containing ores soluble are i fusion of the solid with sodium peroxide followed by extraction of the resulting glass in aqua regia and ii extraction of the solid with a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid from soluble extracts iridium is separated by precipitating solid ammonium hexachloroiridate nh ircl or by extracting ircl with organic amines the first method is similar to the procedure tennant and wollaston used for their original separation the second method can be planned as continuous liquid liquid extraction and is therefore more suitable for industrial scale production in either case the product an iridium chloride salt is reduced with hydrogen yielding the metal as a powder or sponge which is amenable to powder metallurgy techniques iridium prices have fluctuated over a considerable range with a relatively small volume in the world market compared to other industrial metals like aluminium or copper the iridium price reacts strongly to instabilities in production demand speculation hoarding and politics in the producing countries as a substance with rare properties its price has been particularly influenced by changes in modern technology the gradual decrease between and has been related to an oversupply of ir crucibles used for industrial growth of large single crystals likewise the prices above per troy ounce g between and have been explained with the installation of production facilities for single crystal sapphire used in led backlights for tvs the demand for iridium surged from tonnes lb in to tonnes lb in mostly because of electronics related applications that saw a rise from to tonnes to lb iridium crucibles are commonly used for growing large high quality single crystals demand for which has increased sharply this increase in iridium consumption is predicted to saturate due to accumulating stocks of crucibles as happened earlier in the s other major applications include spark plugs that consumed tonnes lb of iridium in electrodes for the chloralkali process t or lb in and chemical catalysts t or lb in applications ir metal and alloys the high melting point hardness and corrosion resistance of iridium and its alloys determine most of its applications resistance to heat and corrosion makes iridium an important alloying agent certain long life aircraft engine parts are made of an iridium alloy and an iridium titanium alloy is used for deep water pipes because of its corrosion resistance iridium is also used as a hardening agent in platinum alloys iridium is used for multi pored spinnerets through which a plastic polymer melt is extruded to form fibers such as rayon osmium iridium is used for compass bearings and for balances because of their resistance to arc erosion iridium alloys are used by some manufactorers for electrical contacts for spark plugs and iridium based spark plugs are particularly used in aviation devices that must withstand extremely high temperatures are often made from iridium for example high temperature crucibles made of iridium are used in the czochralski process to produce oxide single crystals such as sapphires for use in computer memory devices and in solid state lasers the crystals such as gadolinium gallium garnet and yttrium gallium garnet are grown by melting pre sintered charges of mixed oxides under oxidizing conditions at temperatures up to c f catalysis iridium compounds are used as catalysts in the cativa process for carbonylation of methanol to produce acetic acid iridium complexes are often active for asymmetric hydrogenation both by traditional hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation this property is the basis of the industrial route to the chiral herbicide s metolachlor as practiced by syngenta on the scale of tons year the complex ir cod cl in the presence of josiphos ligands medical imaging the radioisotope iridium is one of the two most important sources of energy for use in industrial radiography for non destructive testing of metals additionally ir is used as a source of gamma radiation for the treatment of cancer using brachytherapy a form of radiotherapy where a sealed radioactive source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment specific treatments include high dose rate prostate brachytherapy biliary duct brachytherapy and intracavitary cervix brachytherapy iridium is normally produced by neutron activation of isotop iridium in natural abundance iridium metal the use of iridium iii complexes for imaging of mitochondria has been reviewed photocatalysis and oleds iridium complexes are key components of white oleds similar complexes are used in photocatalysis scientific an alloy of platinum and iridium was used in to construct the international prototype metre and kilogram mass kept by the international bureau of weights and measures near paris the meter bar was replaced as the definition of the fundamental unit of length in by a line in the atomic spectrum of krypton but the kilogram prototype remained the international standard of mass until may when the kilogram was redefined in terms of the planck constant iridium is often used as a coating for non conductive materials in preparation for observation in scanning electron microscopes sem the addition of a to nm to in layer of iridium helps especially organic materials survive electron beam damage and reduces static charge build up within the target area of the sem beam s focal point a coating of iridium also increases the signal to noise ratio associated with secondary electron emission which is essential to using sems for x ray spectrographic composition analysis while other metals can be used for coating objects for sem use iridium is the preferred coating when samples will be studied with a wide variety of imaging parameters iridium has been used in the radioisotope thermoelectric generators of unmanned spacecraft such as the voyager viking pioneer cassini galileo and new horizons iridium was chosen to encapsulate the plutonium fuel in the generator because it can withstand the operating temperatures of up to c f and for its great strength another use concerns x ray optics especially x ray telescopes the mirrors of the chandra x ray observatory are coated with a layer of iridium nm in thick iridium proved to be the best choice for reflecting x rays after nickel gold and platinum were also tested the iridium layer which had to be smooth to within a few atoms was applied by depositing iridium vapor under high vacuum on a base layer of chromium iridium is used in particle physics for the production of antiprotons a form of antimatter antiprotons are made by shooting a high intensity proton beam at a conversion target which needs to be made from a very high density material although tungsten may be used instead iridium has the advantage of better stability under the shock waves induced by the temperature rise due to the incident beam iridium forms a variety of complexes of fundamental interest in triplet harvesting as part of the cationic nucleic acid intercalators iridium is used to detect nucleic acids in cytof experiments to analyse the presence or viability of nucleated cells in biological samples historical iridium osmium alloys were used in fountain pen nib tips the first major use of iridium was in in nibs mounted on gold since the famous parker fountain pen was fitted with a nib tipped by a ruthenium and iridium alloy with iridium the tip material in modern fountain pens is still conventionally called iridium although there is seldom any iridium in it other metals such as ruthenium osmium and tungsten have taken its place an iridium platinum alloy was used for the touch holes or vent pieces of cannon according to a report of the paris exhibition of one of the pieces being exhibited by johnson and matthey has been used in a whitworth gun for more than rounds and scarcely shows signs of wear yet those who know the constant trouble and expense which are occasioned by the wearing of the vent pieces of cannon when in active service will appreciate this important adaptation the pigment iridium black which consists of very finely divided iridium is used for painting porcelain an intense black it was said that all other porcelain black colors appear grey by the side of it precautions iridium in bulk metallic form is not biologically important or hazardous to health due to its lack of reactivity with tissues there are only about parts per trillion of iridium in human tissue like most metals finely divided iridium powder can be hazardous to handle as it is an irritant and may ignite in air by very little is known about the toxicity of iridium compounds primarily because it is used so rarely that few people come in contact with it and those who do only with very small amounts however soluble salts such as the iridium halides could be hazardous due to elements other than iridium or due to iridium itself at the same time most iridium compounds are insoluble which makes absorption into the body difficult a radioisotope of iridium ir is dangerous like other radioactive isotopes the only reported injuries related to iridium concern accidental exposure to radiation from ir used in brachytherapy high energy gamma radiation from ir can increase the risk of cancer external exposure can cause burns radiation poisoning and death ingestion of ir can burn the linings of the stomach and the intestines ir mir and mir tend to deposit in the liver and can pose health hazards from both gamma and beta radiation ,77
Platinum,Pt,platinum is a chemical element with the symbol pt and atomic number it is a dense malleable ductile highly unreactive precious silverish white transition metal its name originates from spanish platina a diminutive of plata silver platinum is a member of the platinum group of elements and group of the periodic table of elements it has six naturally occurring isotopes it is one of the rarer elements in earth s crust with an average abundance of approximately g kg it occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits mostly in south africa which accounts for of the world production because of its scarcity in earth s crust only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually and given its important uses it is highly valuable and is a major precious metal commodity platinum is one of the least reactive metals it has remarkable resistance to corrosion even at high temperatures and is therefore considered a noble metal consequently platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum because it occurs naturally in the alluvial sands of various rivers it was first used by pre columbian south american natives to produce artifacts it was referenced in european writings as early as the th century but it was not until antonio de ulloa published a report on a new metal of colombian origin in that it began to be investigated by scientists platinum is used in catalytic converters laboratory equipment electrical contacts and electrodes platinum resistance thermometers dentistry equipment and jewelry platinum is used in the glass industry to manipulate molten glass which does not wet platinum as a heavy metal it leads to health problems upon exposure to its salts but due to its corrosion resistance metallic platinum has not been linked to adverse health effects compounds containing platinum such as cisplatin oxaliplatin and carboplatin are applied in chemotherapy against certain types of cancer pure platinum is currently less expensive than pure gold having been so continuously since but has been twice as expensive or more in early the value of platinum ranged from us to us per troy ounce characteristics physical pure platinum is a lustrous ductile and malleable silver white metal platinum is more ductile than gold silver or copper thus being the most ductile of pure metals but it is less malleable than gold its physical characteristics and chemical stability make it useful for industrial applications its resistance to wear and tarnish is well suited to use in fine jewellery chemical platinum has excellent resistance to corrosion bulk platinum does not oxidize in air at any temperature but it forms a thin surface film of pto that can be easily removed by heating to about c the most common oxidation states of platinum are and the and oxidation states are less common and are often stabilized by metal bonding in bimetallic or polymetallic species tetracoordinate platinum ii compounds tend to adopt electron square planar geometries although elemental platinum is generally unreactive it is attacked by chlorine bromine iodine and sulfur it reacts vigorously with fluorine at c f to form platinum tetrafluoride platinum is insoluble in hydrochloric and nitric acid but dissolves in hot aqua regia a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids to form aqueous chloroplatinic acid h ptcl pt hno hcl h ptcl no h oas a soft acid the pt ion has a great affinity for sulfide and sulfur ligands numerous dmso complexes have been reported and care is taken in the choosing of reaction solvents in the german scientist gerhard ertl won the nobel prize in chemistry for determining the detailed molecular mechanisms of the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide over platinum catalytic converter isotopes platinum has six naturally occurring isotopes pt pt pt pt pt and pt the most abundant of these is pt comprising of all platinum it is the only stable isotope with a non zero spin the spin of and other favourable magnetic properties of the nucleus are utilised in pt nmr due to its spin and large abundance pt satellite peaks are also often observed in h and p nmr spectroscopy e g for pt phosphine and pt alkyl complexes pt is the least abundant at only of the naturally occurring isotopes only pt is unstable though it decays with a half life of years causing an activity of bq kg of natural platinum pt can undergo alpha decay but its decay has never been observed the half life is known to be longer than years therefore it is considered stable platinum also has synthetic isotopes ranging in atomic mass from to making the total number of known isotopes the least stable of these are pt and pt with half lives of s whereas the most stable is pt with a half life of years most platinum isotopes decay by some combination of beta decay and alpha decay pt pt and pt decay primarily by electron capture pt and pt are predicted to have energetically favorable double beta decay paths occurrence platinum is an extremely rare metal occurring at a concentration of only ppm in earth s crust it is sometimes mistaken for silver platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum and as alloy with the other platinum group metals and iron mostly most often the native platinum is found in secondary deposits in alluvial deposits the alluvial deposits used by pre columbian people in the choc department colombia are still a source for platinum group metals another large alluvial deposit is in the ural mountains russia and it is still mined in nickel and copper deposits platinum group metals occur as sulfides e g pt pd s tellurides e g ptbite antimonides pdsb and arsenides e g ptas and as end alloys with nickel or copper platinum arsenide sperrylite ptas is a major source of platinum associated with nickel ores in the sudbury basin deposit in ontario canada at platinum alaska about kg ozt was mined between and the mine ceased operations in the rare sulfide mineral cooperite pt pd ni s contains platinum along with palladium and nickel cooperite occurs in the merensky reef within the bushveld complex gauteng south africa in chromites were identified in the bushveld region of south africa followed by the discovery of platinum in in the geologist hans merensky discovered a large supply of platinum in the bushveld igneous complex in south africa the specific layer he found named the merensky reef contains around of the world s known platinum the large copper nickel deposits near norilsk in russia and the sudbury basin canada are the two other large deposits in the sudbury basin the huge quantities of nickel ore processed make up for the fact platinum is present as only ppm in the ore smaller reserves can be found in the united states for example in the absaroka range in montana in south africa was the top producer of platinum with an almost share followed by russia at world production in was kg lb large platinum deposits are present in the state of tamil nadu india platinum exists in higher abundances on the moon and in meteorites correspondingly platinum is found in slightly higher abundances at sites of bolide impact on earth that are associated with resulting post impact volcanism and can be mined economically the sudbury basin is one such example compounds halides hexachloroplatinic acid mentioned above is probably the most important platinum compound as it serves as the precursor for many other platinum compounds by itself it has various applications in photography zinc etchings indelible ink plating mirrors porcelain coloring and as a catalyst treatment of hexachloroplatinic acid with an ammonium salt such as ammonium chloride gives ammonium hexachloroplatinate which is relatively insoluble in ammonium solutions heating this ammonium salt in the presence of hydrogen reduces it to elemental platinum potassium hexachloroplatinate is similarly insoluble and hexachloroplatinic acid has been used in the determination of potassium ions by gravimetry when hexachloroplatinic acid is heated it decomposes through platinum iv chloride and platinum ii chloride to elemental platinum although the reactions do not occur stepwise h o ptcl nh o ptcl hcl n h o ptcl ptcl cl ptcl pt cl all three reactions are reversible platinum ii and platinum iv bromides are known as well platinum hexafluoride is a strong oxidizer capable of oxidizing oxygen oxides platinum iv oxide pto also known as adams catalyst is a black powder that is soluble in potassium hydroxide koh solutions and concentrated acids pto and the less common pto both decompose upon heating platinum ii iv oxide pt o is formed in the following reaction pt pt o pt o other compounds unlike palladium acetate platinum ii acetate is not commercially available where a base is desired the halides have been used in conjunction with sodium acetate the use of platinum ii acetylacetonate has also been reported several barium platinides have been synthesized in which platinum exhibits negative oxidation states ranging from to these include bapt ba pt and ba pt caesium platinide cs pt a dark red transparent crystalline compound has been shown to contain pt anions platinum also exhibits negative oxidation states at surfaces reduced electrochemically the negative oxidation states exhibited by platinum are unusual for metallic elements and they are attributed to the relativistic stabilization of the s orbitals it is predicted that even the cation pto in which platinum exists in oxidation state may be achievable zeise s salt containing an ethylene ligand was one of the first organometallic compounds discovered dichloro cycloocta diene platinum ii is a commercially available olefin complex which contains easily displaceable cod ligands cod being an abbreviation of cyclooctadiene the cod complex and the halides are convenient starting points to platinum chemistry cisplatin or cis diamminedichloroplatinum ii is the first of a series of square planar platinum ii containing chemotherapy drugs others include carboplatin and oxaliplatin these compounds are capable of crosslinking dna and kill cells by similar pathways to alkylating chemotherapeutic agents side effects of cisplatin include nausea and vomiting hair loss tinnitus hearing loss and nephrotoxicity organoplatinum compounds such as the above antitumour agents as well as soluble inorganic platinum complexes are routinely characterised using pt nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy history early uses archaeologists have discovered traces of platinum in the gold used in ancient egyptian burials as early as bc for example a small box from burial of shepenupet ii was found to be decorated with gold platinum hieroglyphics however the extent of early egyptians knowledge of the metal is unclear it is quite possible they did not recognize there was platinum in their gold the metal was used by native americans near modern day esmeraldas ecuador to produce artifacts of a white gold platinum alloy archeologists usually associate the tradition of platinum working in south america with the la tolita culture circa bc ad but precise dates and location is difficult as most platinum artifacts from the area were bought secondhand through the antiquities trade rather than obtained by direct archeological excavation to work the metal they would combine gold and platinum powders by sintering the resulting gold platinum alloy would then be soft enough to shape with tools the platinum used in such objects was not the pure element but rather a naturally occurring mixture of the platinum group metals with small amounts of palladium rhodium and iridium european discovery the first european reference to platinum appears in in the writings of the italian humanist julius caesar scaliger as a description of an unknown noble metal found between dari n and mexico which no fire nor any spanish artifice has yet been able to liquefy from their first encounters with platinum the spanish generally saw the metal as a kind of impurity in gold and it was treated as such it was often simply thrown away and there was an official decree forbidding the adulteration of gold with platinum impurities in antonio de ulloa and jorge juan y santacilia saw native americans mining platinum while the spaniards were travelling through colombia and peru for eight years ulloa and juan found mines with the whitish metal nuggets and took them home to spain antonio de ulloa returned to spain and established the first mineralogy lab in spain and was the first to systematically study platinum which was in his historical account of the expedition included a description of platinum as being neither separable nor calcinable ulloa also anticipated the discovery of platinum mines after publishing the report in ulloa did not continue to investigate the new metal in he was sent to superintend mercury mining operations in huancavelica in charles wood a british metallurgist found various samples of colombian platinum in jamaica which he sent to william brownrigg for further investigation in after studying the platinum sent to him by wood brownrigg presented a detailed account of the metal to the royal society stating that he had seen no mention of it in any previous accounts of known minerals brownrigg also made note of platinum s extremely high melting point and refractoriness toward borax other chemists across europe soon began studying platinum including andreas sigismund marggraf torbern bergman j ns jakob berzelius william lewis and pierre macquer in henrik scheffer published a detailed scientific description of the metal which he referred to as white gold including an account of how he succeeded in fusing platinum ore with the aid of arsenic scheffer described platinum as being less pliable than gold but with similar resistance to corrosion means of malleability karl von sickingen researched platinum extensively in he succeeded in making malleable platinum by alloying it with gold dissolving the alloy in hot aqua regia precipitating the platinum with ammonium chloride igniting the ammonium chloroplatinate and hammering the resulting finely divided platinum to make it cohere franz karl achard made the first platinum crucible in he worked with the platinum by fusing it with arsenic then later volatilizing the arsenic because the other platinum family members were not discovered yet platinum was the first in the list scheffer and sickingen made the false assumption that due to its hardness which is slightly more than for pure iron platinum would be a relatively non pliable material even brittle at times when in fact its ductility and malleability are close to that of gold their assumptions could not be avoided because the platinum they experimented with was highly contaminated with minute amounts of platinum family elements such as osmium and iridium amongst others which embrittled the platinum alloy alloying this impure platinum residue called plyoxen with gold was the only solution at the time to obtain a pliable compound but nowadays very pure platinum is available and extremely long wires can be drawn from pure platinum very easily due to its crystalline structure which is similar to that of many soft metals in charles iii of spain provided a library and laboratory to pierre fran ois chabaneau to aid in his research of platinum chabaneau succeeded in removing various impurities from the ore including gold mercury lead copper and iron this led him to believe he was working with a single metal but in truth the ore still contained the yet undiscovered platinum group metals this led to inconsistent results in his experiments at times the platinum seemed malleable but when it was alloyed with iridium it would be much more brittle sometimes the metal was entirely incombustible but when alloyed with osmium it would volatilize after several months chabaneau succeeded in producing kilograms of pure malleable platinum by hammering and compressing the sponge form while white hot chabeneau realized the infusibility of platinum would lend value to objects made of it and so started a business with joaqu n cabezas producing platinum ingots and utensils this started what is known as the platinum age in spain production platinum along with the rest of the platinum group metals is obtained commercially as a by product from nickel and copper mining and processing during electrorefining of copper noble metals such as silver gold and the platinum group metals as well as selenium and tellurium settle to the bottom of the cell as anode mud which forms the starting point for the extraction of the platinum group metals if pure platinum is found in placer deposits or other ores it is isolated from them by various methods of subtracting impurities because platinum is significantly denser than many of its impurities the lighter impurities can be removed by simply floating them away in a liquid platinum is paramagnetic whereas nickel and iron are both ferromagnetic these two impurities are thus removed by running an electromagnet over the mixture because platinum has a higher melting point than most other substances many impurities can be burned or melted away without melting the platinum finally platinum is resistant to hydrochloric and sulfuric acids whereas other substances are readily attacked by them metal impurities can be removed by stirring the mixture in either of the two acids and recovering the remaining platinum one suitable method for purification for the raw platinum which contains platinum gold and the other platinum group metals is to process it with aqua regia in which palladium gold and platinum are dissolved whereas osmium iridium ruthenium and rhodium stay unreacted the gold is precipitated by the addition of iron ii chloride and after filtering off the gold the platinum is precipitated as ammonium chloroplatinate by the addition of ammonium chloride ammonium chloroplatinate can be converted to platinum by heating unprecipitated hexachloroplatinate iv may be reduced with elemental zinc and a similar method is suitable for small scale recovery of platinum from laboratory residues mining and refining platinum has environmental impacts applications of the tonnes of platinum sold in tonnes were used for vehicle emissions control devices tonnes for jewelry tonnes for chemical production and petroleum refining and tonnes for electrical applications such as hard disk drives the remaining tonnes went to various other minor applications such as medicine and biomedicine glassmaking equipment investment electrodes anticancer drugs oxygen sensors spark plugs and turbine engines catalyst the most common use of platinum is as a catalyst in chemical reactions often as platinum black it has been employed as a catalyst since the early th century when platinum powder was used to catalyze the ignition of hydrogen its most important application is in automobiles as a catalytic converter which allows the complete combustion of low concentrations of unburned hydrocarbons from the exhaust into carbon dioxide and water vapor platinum is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst in a number of separate processes but especially in catalytic reforming of straight run naphthas into higher octane gasoline that becomes rich in aromatic compounds pto also known as adams catalyst is used as a hydrogenation catalyst specifically for vegetable oils platinum also strongly catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen and it is used in fuel cells as a catalyst for the reduction of oxygen standard from to the meter was defined as the length of a platinum iridium alloy bar known as the international prototype meter the previous bar was made of platinum in until may the kilogram was defined as the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram a cylinder of the same platinum iridium alloy made in the standard platinum resistance thermometer sprt is one of the four types of thermometers used to define the international temperature scale of its

purity of by weight in addition to laboratory uses platinum resistance thermometry prt also has many industrial applications industrial standards include astm e and iec the standard hydrogen electrode also uses a platinized platinum electrode due to its corrosion resistance and other attributes as an investment platinum is a precious metal commodity its bullion has the iso currency code of xpt coins bars and ingots are traded or collected platinum finds use in jewellery usually as a alloy due to its inertness it is used for this purpose for its prestige and inherent bullion value jewellery trade publications advise jewellers to present minute surface scratches which they term patina as a desirable feature in an attempt to enhance value of platinum products in watchmaking vacheron constantin patek philippe rolex breitling and other companies use platinum for producing their limited edition watch series watchmakers appreciate the unique properties of platinum as it neither tarnishes nor wears out the latter quality relative to gold during periods of sustained economic stability and growth the price of platinum tends to be as much as twice the price of gold whereas during periods of economic uncertainty the price of platinum tends to decrease due to reduced industrial demand falling below the price of gold gold prices are more stable in slow economic times as gold is considered a safe haven although gold is also used in industrial applications especially in electronics due to its use as a conductor its demand is not so driven by industrial uses in the th century platinum s rarity made king louis xv of france declare it the only metal fit for a king other uses in the laboratory platinum wire is used for electrodes platinum pans and supports are used in thermogravimetric analysis because of the stringent requirements of chemical inertness upon heating to high temperatures c platinum is used as an alloying agent for various metal products including fine wires noncorrosive laboratory containers medical instruments dental prostheses electrical contacts and thermocouples platinum cobalt an alloy of roughly three parts platinum and one part cobalt is used to make relatively strong permanent magnets platinum based anodes are used in ships pipelines and steel piers platinum drugs are used to treat a wide variety of cancers including testicular and ovarian carcinomas melanoma small cell and non small cell lung cancer myelomas and lymphomas symbol of prestige in marketing platinum s rarity as a metal has caused advertisers to associate it with exclusivity and wealth platinum debit and credit cards have greater privileges than gold cards platinum awards are the second highest possible ranking above gold silver and bronze but below diamond for example in the united states a musical album that has sold more than million copies will be credited as platinum whereas an album that has sold more than million copies will be certified as diamond some products such as blenders and vehicles with a silvery white color are identified as platinum platinum is considered a precious metal although its use is not as common as the use of gold or silver the frame of the crown of queen elizabeth the queen mother manufactured for her coronation as consort of king george vi is made of platinum it was the first british crown to be made of this particular metal health problems according to the centers for disease control and prevention short term exposure to platinum salts may cause irritation of the eyes nose and throat and long term exposure may cause both respiratory and skin allergies the current osha standard is micrograms per cubic meter of air averaged over an hour work shift the national institute for occupational safety and health has set a recommended exposure limit rel for platinum as mg m over an hour workday as platinum is a catalyst in the manufacture of the silicone rubber and gel components of several types of medical implants breast implants joint replacement prosthetics artificial lumbar discs vascular access ports etc the possibility that platinum could enter the body and cause adverse effects has merited study the food and drug administration and other institutions have reviewed the issue and found no evidence to suggest toxicity in vivo chemically unbounded platinum has been identified by the fda as a fake cancer cure the misunderstanding is created by healthcare workers who are using inappropriately the name of the metal as a slang term for platinum based chemotherapy medications like cisplatin they are platinum compounds not the metal itself ,78
Gold,Au,gold is a chemical element with the symbol au from latin aurum and atomic number this makes it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally it is a bright slightly orange yellow dense soft malleable and ductile metal in a pure form chemically gold is a transition metal and a group element it is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions gold often occurs in free elemental native state as nuggets or grains in rocks veins and alluvial deposits it occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver as electrum naturally alloyed with other metals like copper and palladium and mineral inclusions such as within pyrite less commonly it occurs in minerals as gold compounds often with tellurium gold tellurides gold is resistant to most acids though it does dissolve in aqua regia a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid forming a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion gold is insoluble in nitric acid alone which dissolves silver and base metals a property long used to refine gold and confirm the presence of gold in metallic substances giving rise to the term acid test gold dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide which are used in mining and electroplating gold also dissolves in mercury forming amalgam alloys and as the gold acts simply as a solute this is not a chemical reaction a relatively rare element gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage jewelry and other arts throughout recorded history in the past a gold standard was often implemented as a monetary policy gold coins ceased to be minted as a circulating currency in the s and the world gold standard was abandoned for a fiat currency system after the nixon shock measures of in the world s largest gold producer was china followed by russia and australia a total of around tonnes of gold exists above ground as of this is equal to a cube with each side measuring roughly meters ft the world consumption of new gold produced is about in jewelry in investments and in industry gold s high malleability ductility resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions and conductivity of electricity have led to its continued use in corrosion resistant electrical connectors in all types of computerized devices its chief industrial use gold is also used in infrared shielding production of colored glass gold leafing and tooth restoration certain gold salts are still used as anti inflammatories in medicine characteristics gold is the most malleable of all metals it can be drawn into a wire of single atom width and then stretched considerably before it breaks such nanowires distort via formation reorientation and migration of dislocations and crystal twins without noticeable hardening a single gram of gold can be beaten into a sheet of square metre sq ft and an avoirdupois ounce into square feet m gold leaf can be beaten thin enough to become semi transparent the transmitted light appears greenish blue because gold strongly reflects yellow and red such semi transparent sheets also strongly reflect infrared light making them useful as infrared radiant heat shields in visors of heat resistant suits and in sun visors for spacesuits gold is a good conductor of heat and electricity gold has a density of g cm almost identical to that of tungsten at g cm as such tungsten has been used in counterfeiting of gold bars such as by plating a tungsten bar with gold or taking an existing gold bar drilling holes and replacing the removed gold with tungsten rods by comparison the density of lead is g cm and that of the densest element osmium is g cm color whereas most metals are gray or silvery white gold is slightly reddish yellow this color is determined by the frequency of plasma oscillations among the metal s valence electrons in the ultraviolet range for most metals but in the visible range for gold due to relativistic effects affecting the orbitals around gold atoms similar effects impart a golden hue to metallic caesium common colored gold alloys include the distinctive eighteen karat rose gold created by the addition of copper alloys containing palladium or nickel are also important in commercial jewelry as these produce white gold alloys fourteen karat gold copper alloy is nearly identical in color to certain bronze alloys and both may be used to produce police and other badges fourteen and eighteen karat gold alloys with silver alone appear greenish yellow and are referred to as green gold blue gold can be made by alloying with iron and purple gold can be made by alloying with aluminium less commonly addition of manganese indium and other elements can produce more unusual colors of gold for various applications colloidal gold used by electron microscopists is red if the particles are small larger particles of colloidal gold are blue isotopes gold has only one stable isotope au which is also its only naturally occurring isotope so gold is both a mononuclidic and monoisotopic element thirty six radioisotopes have been synthesized ranging in atomic mass from to the most stable of these is au with a half life of days the least stable is au which decays by proton emission with a half life of s most of gold s radioisotopes with atomic masses below decay by some combination of proton emission decay and decay the exceptions are au which decays by electron capture and au which decays most often by electron capture with a minor decay path all of gold s radioisotopes with atomic masses above decay by decay at least nuclear isomers have also been characterized ranging in atomic mass from to within that range only au au au au and au do not have isomers gold s most stable isomer is m au with a half life of days gold s least stable isomer is m au with a half life of only ns m au has three decay paths decay isomeric transition and alpha decay no other isomer or isotope of gold has three decay paths synthesis the possible production of gold from a more common element such as lead has long been a subject of human inquiry and the ancient and medieval discipline of alchemy often focused on it however the transmutation of the chemical elements did not become possible until the understanding of nuclear physics in the th century the first synthesis of gold was conducted by japanese physicist hantaro nagaoka who synthesized gold from mercury in by neutron bombardment an american team working without knowledge of nagaoka s prior study conducted the same experiment in achieving the same result and showing that the isotopes of gold produced by it were all radioactive in glenn seaborg transmuted several thousand atoms of bismuth into gold at the lawrence berkeley laboratory gold can be manufactured in a nuclear reactor but doing so is highly impractical and would cost far more than the value of the gold that is produced chemistry although gold is the most noble of the noble metals it still forms many diverse compounds the oxidation state of gold in its compounds ranges from to but au i and au iii dominate its chemistry au i referred to as the aurous ion is the most common oxidation state with soft ligands such as thioethers thiolates and organophosphines au i compounds are typically linear a good example is au cn which is the soluble form of gold encountered in mining

common oxidation states of gold include gold i or aurous compounds and gold iii or auric compounds gold ions in solution are readily reduced and precipitated as metal by adding any other metal as the reducing agent the added metal is oxidized and dissolves allowing the gold to be displaced from solution and be recovered as a solid precipitate rare oxidation states less common oxidation states of

oxidation state a representative example is the octahedral species au p c h origin gold production in the universe gold is thought to have been produced in supernova nucleosynthesis and from the collision of neutron stars and to have been present in the dust from which the solar system formed traditionally gold in the universe is thought to have formed by the r process rapid neutron capture in supernova nucleosynthesis but more recently it has been suggested that gold and other elements heavier than iron may also be produced in quantity by the r process in the collision of neutron stars in both cases satellite spectrometers at first only indirectly detected the resulting gold however in august the spectroscopic signatures of heavy elements including gold were observed by electromagnetic observatories in the gw neutron star merger event after gravitational wave detectors confirmed the event as a neutron star merger current astrophysical models suggest that this single neutron star merger event generated between and earth masses of gold this amount along with estimations of the rate of occurrence of these neutron star merger events suggests that such mergers may produce enough gold to account for most of the abundance of this element in the universe asteroid origin theories because the earth was molten when it was formed almost all of the gold present in the early earth probably sank into the planetary core therefore most of the gold that is in the earth s crust and mantle has in one model thought to have been delivered to earth later by asteroid impacts during the late heavy bombardment about billion years ago gold which is reachable by humans has in one case been associated with a particular asteroid impact the asteroid that formed vredefort impact structure billion years ago is often credited with seeding the witwatersrand basin in south africa with the richest gold deposits on earth however this scenario is now questioned the gold bearing witwatersrand rocks were laid down between and million years before the vredefort impact these gold bearing rocks had furthermore been covered by a thick layer of ventersdorp lavas and the transvaal supergroup of rocks before the meteor struck and thus the gold did not actually arrive in the asteroid meteorite what the vredefort impact achieved however was to distort the witwatersrand basin in such a way that the gold bearing rocks were brought to the present erosion surface in johannesburg on the witwatersrand just inside the rim of the original km mi diameter crater caused by the meteor strike the discovery of the deposit in launched the witwatersrand gold rush some of all the gold that is ascertained to exist today on earth has been extracted from these witwatersrand rocks mantle return theories notwithstanding the impact above much of the rest of the gold on earth is thought to have been incorporated into the planet since its very beginning as planetesimals formed the planet s mantle early in earth s creation in an international group of scientists established that gold came to the earth s surface from the deepest regions of our planet the mantle evidenced by their findings at deseado massif in the argentinian patagonia occurrence on earth gold is found in ores in rock formed from the precambrian time onward it most often occurs as a native metal typically in a metal solid solution with silver i e as a gold silver alloy such alloys usually have a silver content of electrum is elemental gold with more than silver and is commonly known as white gold electrum s color runs from golden silvery to silvery dependent upon the silver content the more silver the lower the specific gravity native gold occurs as very small to microscopic particles embedded in rock often together with quartz or sulfide minerals such as fool s gold which is a pyrite these are called lode deposits the metal in a native state is also found in the form of free flakes grains or larger nuggets that have been eroded from rocks and end up in alluvial deposits called placer deposits such free gold is always richer at the exposed surface of gold bearing veins owing to the oxidation of accompanying minerals followed by weathering and by washing of the dust into streams and rivers where it collects and can be welded by water action to form nuggets gold sometimes occurs combined with tellurium as the minerals calaverite krennerite nagyagite petzite and sylvanite see telluride minerals and as the rare bismuthide maldonite au bi and antimonide aurostibite ausb gold also occurs in rare alloys with copper lead and mercury the minerals auricupride cu au novodneprite aupb and weishanite au ag hg recent research suggests that microbes can sometimes play an important role in forming gold deposits transporting and precipitating gold to form grains and nuggets that collect in alluvial deposits another recent study has claimed water in faults vaporizes during an earthquake depositing gold when an earthquake strikes it moves along a fault water often lubricates faults filling in fractures and jogs about kilometres mi below the surface under very high temperatures and pressures the water carries high concentrations of carbon dioxide silica and gold during an earthquake the fault jog suddenly opens wider the water inside the void instantly vaporizes flashing to steam and forcing silica which forms the mineral quartz and gold out of the fluids and onto nearby surfaces seawater the world s oceans contain gold measured concentrations of gold in the atlantic and northeast pacific are femtomol l or parts per quadrillion about g km in general gold concentrations for south atlantic and central pacific samples are the same femtomol l but less certain mediterranean deep waters contain slightly higher concentrations of gold femtomol l attributed to wind blown dust and or rivers at parts per quadrillion the earth s oceans would hold tonnes of gold these figures are three orders of magnitude less than reported in the literature prior to indicating contamination problems with the earlier data a number of people have claimed to be able to economically recover gold from sea water but they were either mistaken or acted in an intentional deception prescott jernegan ran a gold from seawater swindle in the united states in the s as did an english fraudster in the early s fritz haber did research on the extraction of gold from sea water in an effort to help pay germany s reparations following world war i based on the published values of to ppb of gold in seawater a commercially successful extraction seemed possible after analysis of water samples yielding an average of ppb it became clear that extraction would not be possible and he ended the project history the earliest recorded metal employed by humans appears to be gold which can be found free or native small amounts of natural gold have been found in spanish caves used during the late paleolithic period c bc the oldest gold artifacts in the world are from bulgaria and are dating back to the th millennium bc bc to bc such as those found in the varna necropolis near lake varna and the black sea coast thought to be the earliest well dated finding of gold artifacts in history several prehistoric bulgarian finds are considered no less old the golden treasures of hotnitsa durankulak artifacts from the kurgan settlement of yunatsite near pazardzhik the golden treasure sakar as well as beads and gold jewelry found in the kurgan settlement of provadia solnitsata salt pit however varna gold is most often called the oldest since this treasure is the largest and most diverse gold artifacts probably made their first appearance in ancient egypt at the very beginning of the pre dynastic period at the end of the fifth millennium bc and the start of the fourth and smelting was developed during the course of the th millennium gold artifacts appear in the archeology of lower mesopotamia during the early th millennium as of gold artifacts found at the wadi qana cave cemetery of the th millennium bc in west bank were the earliest from the levant gold artifacts such as the golden hats and the nebra disk appeared in central europe from the nd millennium bc bronze age the oldest known map of a gold mine was drawn in the th dynasty of ancient egypt bc whereas the first written reference to gold was recorded in the th dynasty around bc egyptian hieroglyphs from as early as bc describe gold which king tushratta of the mitanni claimed was more plentiful than dirt in egypt egypt and especially nubia had the resources to make them major gold producing areas for much of history one of the earliest known maps known as the turin papyrus map shows the plan of a gold mine in nubia together with indications of the local geology the primitive working methods are described by both strabo and diodorus siculus and included fire setting large mines were also present across the red sea in what is now saudi arabia gold is mentioned in the amarna letters numbered and from around the th century bc gold is mentioned frequently in the old testament starting with genesis at havilah the story of the golden calf and many parts of the temple including the menorah and the golden altar in the new testament it is included with the gifts of the magi in the first chapters of matthew the book of revelation describes the city of new jerusalem as having streets made of pure gold clear as crystal exploitation of gold in the south east corner of the black sea is said to date from the time of midas and this gold was important in the establishment of what is probably the world s earliest coinage in lydia around bc the legend of the golden fleece dating from eighth century bce may refer to the use of fleeces to trap gold dust from placer deposits in the ancient world from the th or th century bc the chu state circulated the ying yuan one kind of square gold coin in roman metallurgy new methods for extracting gold on a large scale were developed by introducing hydraulic mining methods especially in hispania from bc onwards and in dacia from ad onwards one of their largest mines was at las medulas in le n where seven long aqueducts enabled them to sluice most of a large alluvial deposit the mines at ro ia montan in transylvania were also very large and until very recently still mined by opencast methods they also exploited smaller deposits in britain such as placer and hard rock deposits at dolaucothi the various methods they used are well described by pliny the elder in his encyclopedia naturalis historia written towards the end of the first century ad during mansa musa s ruler of the mali empire from to hajj to mecca in he passed through cairo in july and was reportedly accompanied by a camel train that included thousands of people and nearly a hundred camels where he gave away so much gold that it depressed the price in egypt for over a decade causing high inflation a contemporary arab historian remarked gold was at a high price in egypt until they came in that year the mithqal did not go below dirhams and was generally above but from that time its value fell and it cheapened in price and has remained cheap till now the mithqal does not exceed dirhams or less this has been the state of affairs for about twelve years until this day by reason of the large amount of gold which they brought into egypt and spent there the european exploration of the americas was fueled in no small part by reports of the gold ornaments displayed in great profusion by native american peoples especially in mesoamerica peru ecuador and colombia the aztecs regarded gold as the product of the gods calling it literally god excrement teocuitlatl in nahuatl and after moctezuma ii was killed most of this gold was shipped to spain however for the indigenous peoples of north america gold was considered useless and they saw much greater value in other minerals which were directly related to their utility such as obsidian flint and slate el dorado is applied to a legendary story in which precious stones were found in fabulous abundance along with gold coins the concept of el dorado underwent several transformations and eventually accounts of the previous myth were also combined with those of a legendary lost city el dorado was the term used by the spanish empire to describe a mythical tribal chief zipa of the muisca native people in colombia who as an initiation rite covered himself with gold dust and submerged in lake guatavita the legends surrounding el dorado changed over time as it went from being a man to a city to a kingdom and then finally to an empire beginning in the early modern period european exploration and colonization of west africa was driven in large part by reports of gold deposits in the region which was eventually referred to by europeans as the gold coast from the late th to early th centuries european trade in the region was primarily focused in gold along with ivory and slaves the gold trade in west africa was dominated by the ashanti empire who initially traded with the portuguese before branching out and trading with british french spanish and danish merchants british desires to secure control of west african gold deposits played a role in the anglo ashanti wars of the late th century which saw the ashanti empire annexed by britain gold played a role in western culture as a cause for desire and of corruption as told in children s fables such as rumpelstiltskin where rumpelstiltskin turns hay into gold for the peasant s daughter in return for her child when she becomes a princess and the stealing of the hen that lays golden eggs in jack and the beanstalk the top prize at the olympic games and many other sports competitions is the gold medal of the presently accounted for gold has been extracted since two thirds since one main goal of the alchemists was to produce gold from other substances such as lead presumably by the interaction with a mythical substance called the philosopher s stone trying to produce gold led the alchemists to systematically find out what can be done with substances and this laid the foundation for today s chemistry which can produce gold albeit uneconomically by using nuclear transmutation their symbol for gold was the circle with a point at its center which was also the astrological symbol and the ancient chinese character for the sun the dome of the rock is covered with an ultra thin golden glassier the sikh golden temple the harmandir sahib is a building covered with gold similarly the wat phra kaew emerald buddhist temple wat in thailand has ornamental gold leafed statues and roofs some european king and queen s crowns were made of gold and gold was used for the bridal crown since antiquity an ancient talmudic text circa ad describes rachel wife of rabbi akiva receiving a jerusalem of gold diadem a greek burial crown made of gold was found in a grave circa bc etymology gold is cognate with similar words in many germanic languages deriving via proto germanic gul from proto indo european elh to shine to gleam to be yellow or green the symbol au is from the latin aurum the latin word for gold the proto indo european ancestor of aurum was h h us o meaning glow this word is derived from the same root proto indo european h u es to dawn as h u s s the ancestor of the latin word aurora dawn this etymological relationship is presumably behind the frequent claim in scientific publications that aurum meant shining dawn culture in popular culture gold is a high standard of excellence often used in awards great achievements are frequently rewarded with gold in the form of gold medals gold trophies and other decorations winners of athletic events and other graded competitions are usually awarded a gold medal many awards such as the nobel prize are made from gold as well other award statues and prizes are depicted in gold or are gold plated such as the academy awards the golden globe awards the emmy awards the palme d or and the british academy film awards aristotle in his ethics used gold symbolism when referring to what is now known as the golden mean similarly gold is associated with perfect or divine principles such as in the case of the golden ratio and the golden rule gold is further associated with the wisdom of aging and fruition the fiftieth wedding anniversary is golden a person s most valued or most successful latter years are sometimes considered golden years the height of a civilization is referred to as a golden age religion in some forms of christianity and judaism gold has been associated both with the sacred and evil in the book of exodus the golden calf is a symbol of idolatry while in the book of genesis abraham was said to be rich in gold and silver and moses was instructed to cover the mercy seat of the ark of the covenant with pure gold in byzantine iconography the halos of christ virgin mary and the saints are often golden in islam gold along with silk is often cited as being forbidden for men to wear abu bakr al jazaeri quoting a hadith said that t he wearing of silk and gold are forbidden on the males of my nation and they are lawful to their women this however has not been enforced consistently throughout history e g in the ottoman empire further small gold accents on clothing such as in embroidery may be permitted in ancient greek religion and mythology theia was seen as the goddess of gold silver and other gems according to christopher columbus those who had something of gold were in possession of something of great value on earth and a substance to even help souls to paradise wedding rings are typically made of gold it is long lasting and unaffected by the passage of time and may aid in the ring symbolism of eternal vows before god and the perfection the marriage signifies in orthodox christian wedding ceremonies the wedded couple is adorned with a golden crown though some opt for wreaths instead during the ceremony an amalgamation of symbolic rites on august israeli archaeologists discovered a trove of early islamic gold coins near the central city of yavne analysis of the extremely rare collection of gold coins indicated that they were from the late th century dating to around years back the gold coins were from the abbasid caliphate production according to the united states geological survey in about troy ounces t of gold has been accounted for of which remains in active use mining and prospecting since the s south africa has been the source of a large proportion of the world s gold supply and about of the gold presently accounted is from south africa production in accounted for of the world supply about tonnes in china with tonnes overtook south africa as the world s largest gold producer the first time since that south africa had not been the largest in china was the world s leading gold mining country followed in order by russia australia the united states canada and ghana in south america the controversial project pascua lama aims at exploitation of rich fields in the high mountains of atacama desert at the border between chile and argentina it has been estimated that up to one quarter of the yearly global gold production originates from artisanal or small scale mining the city of johannesburg located in south africa was founded as a result of the witwatersrand gold rush which resulted in the discovery of some of the largest natural gold deposits in recorded history the gold fields are confined to the northern and north western edges of the witwatersrand basin which is a km mi thick layer of archean rocks located in most places deep under the free state gauteng and surrounding provinces these witwatersrand rocks are exposed at the surface on the witwatersrand in and around johannesburg but also in isolated patches to the south east and south west of johannesburg as well as in an arc around the vredefort dome which lies close to the center of the witwatersrand basin from these surface exposures the basin dips extensively requiring some of the mining to occur at depths of nearly m ft making them especially the savuka and tautona mines to the south west of johannesburg the deepest mines on earth the gold is found only in six areas where archean rivers from the north and north west formed extensive pebbly braided river deltas before draining into the witwatersrand sea where the rest of the witwatersrand sediments were deposited the second boer war of between the british empire and the afrikaner boers was at least partly over the rights of miners and possession of the gold wealth in south africa during the th century gold rushes occurred whenever large gold deposits were discovered the first documented discovery of gold in the united states was at the reed gold mine near georgeville north carolina in the first major gold strike in the united states occurred in a small north georgia town called dahlonega further gold rushes occurred in california colorado the black hills otago in new zealand a number of locations across australia witwatersrand in south africa and the klondike in canada grasberg mine located in papua indonesia is the largest gold mine in the world extraction and refining gold extraction is most economical in large easily mined deposits ore grades as little as parts per million ppm can be economical typical ore grades in open pit mines are ppm ore grades in underground or hard rock mines are usually at least ppm because ore grades of ppm are usually needed before gold is visible to the naked eye in most gold mines the gold is invisible the average gold mining and extraction costs were about per troy ounce in but these can vary widely depending on mining type and ore quality global mine production amounted to tonnes after initial production gold is often subsequently refined industrially by the wohlwill process which is based on electrolysis or by the miller process that is chlorination in the melt the wohlwill process results in higher purity but is more complex and is only applied in small scale installations other methods of assaying and purifying smaller amounts of gold include parting and inquartation as well as cupellation or refining methods based on the dissolution of gold in aqua regia as of the amount of carbon dioxide co produced in mining a kilogram of gold is tonnes while recycling a kilogram of gold produces kilograms of co equivalent approximately percent of the global gold supply is recycled and not mined as of corporations are starting to adopt gold recycling including jewelry companies such as generation collection and computer companies including dell consumption the consumption of gold produced in the world is about in jewelry in investments and in industry according to the world gold council china was the world s largest single consumer of gold in overtaking india pollution gold production is associated with contribution to hazardous pollution low grade gold ore may contain less than one ppm gold metal such ore is ground and mixed with sodium cyanide to dissolve the gold cyanide is a highly poisonous chemical which can kill living creatures when exposed in minute quantities many cyanide spills from gold mines have occurred in both developed and developing countries which killed aquatic life in long stretches of affected rivers environmentalists consider these events major environmental disasters up to thirty tons of used ore can dumped as waste for producing one troy ounce of gold gold ore dumps are the source of many heavy elements such as cadmium lead zinc copper arsenic selenium and mercury when sulfide bearing minerals in these ore dumps are exposed to air and water the sulfide transforms into sulfuric acid which in turn dissolves these heavy metals facilitating their passage into surface water and ground water this process is called acid mine drainage these gold ore dumps are long term highly hazardous wastes second only to nuclear waste dumps it was once common to use mercury to recover gold from ore but today the use of mercury is largely limited to small scale individual miners minute quantities of mercury compounds can reach water bodies causing heavy metal contamination mercury can then enter into the human food chain in the form of methylmercury mercury poisoning in humans causes incurable brain function damage and severe retardation gold extraction is also a highly energy intensive industry extracting ore from deep mines and grinding the large quantity of ore for further chemical extraction requires nearly kwh of electricity per gram of gold produced monetary use gold has been widely used throughout the world as money for efficient indirect exchange versus barter and to store wealth in hoards for exchange purposes mints produce standardized gold bullion coins bars and other units of fixed weight and purity the first known coins containing gold were struck in lydia asia minor around bc the talent coin of gold in use during the periods of grecian history both before and during the time of the life of homer weighed between and grams from an earlier preference in using silver european economies re established the minting of gold as coinage during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries bills that mature into gold coin and gold certificates convertible into gold coin at the issuing bank added to the circulating stock of gold standard money in most th century industrial economies in preparation for world war i the warring nations moved to fractional gold standards inflating their currencies to finance the war effort post war the victorious countries most notably britain gradually restored gold convertibility but international flows of gold via bills of exchange remained embargoed international shipments were made exclusively for bilateral trades or to pay war reparations after world war ii gold was replaced by a system of nominally convertible currencies related by fixed exchange rates following the bretton woods system gold standards and the direct convertibility of currencies to gold have been abandoned by world governments led in by the united states refusal to redeem its dollars in gold fiat currency now fills most monetary roles switzerland was the last country to tie its currency to gold this was ended by a referendum in central banks continue to keep a portion of their liquid reserves as gold in some form and metals exchanges such as the london bullion market association still clear transactions denominated in gold including future delivery contracts today gold mining output is declining with the sharp growth of economies in the th century and increasing foreign exchange the world s gold reserves and their trading market have become a small fraction of all markets and fixed exchange rates of currencies to gold have been replaced by floating prices for gold and gold future contract though the gold stock grows by only or per year very little metal is irretrievably consumed inventory above ground would satisfy many decades of industrial and even artisan uses at current prices the gold proportion fineness of alloys is measured by karat k pure gold commercially termed fine gold is designated as karat abbreviated k english gold coins intended for circulation from into the s were typically a standard k alloy called crown gold for hardness american gold coins for circulation after contain an alloy of fine gold or kt although the prices of some platinum group metals can be much higher gold has long been considered the most desirable of precious metals and its value has been used as the standard for many currencies gold has been used as a symbol for purity value royalty and particularly roles that combine these properties gold as a sign of wealth and prestige was ridiculed by thomas more in his treatise utopia on that imaginary island gold is so abundant that it is used to make chains for slaves tableware and lavatory seats when ambassadors from other countries arrive dressed in ostentatious gold jewels and badges the utopians mistake them for menial servants paying homage instead to the most modestly dressed of their party the iso currency code of gold is xau many holders of gold store it in form of bullion coins or bars as a hedge against inflation or other economic disruptions though its efficacy as such has been questioned historically it has not proven itself reliable as a hedging instrument modern bullion coins for investment or collector purposes do not require good mechanical wear properties they are typically fine

began producing the american buffalo gold bullion coin with a purity of the australian gold kangaroos were first coined in as the australian gold nugget but changed the reverse design in other modern coins include the austrian vienna philharmonic bullion coin and the chinese gold panda price as of september gold is valued at around per gram per troy ounce like other precious metals gold is measured by troy weight and by grams the proportion of gold in the alloy is measured by karat k with karat k being pure gold and lower karat numbers proportionally less k the purity of a gold bar or coin can also be expressed as a decimal figure ranging from to known as the millesimal fineness such as being nearly pure the price of gold is determined through trading in the gold and derivatives markets but a procedure known as the gold fixing in london originating in september provides a daily benchmark price to the industry the afternoon fixing was introduced in to provide a price when us markets are open history historically gold coinage was widely used as currency when paper money was introduced it typically was a receipt redeemable for gold coin or bullion in a monetary system known as the gold standard a certain weight of gold was given the name of a unit of currency for a long period the united states government set the value of the us dollar so that one troy ounce was equal to per gram but in the dollar was devalued to per troy ounce g by it was becoming hard to maintain this price and a pool of us and european banks agreed to manipulate the market to prevent further currency devaluation against increased gold demand on march economic circumstances caused the collapse of the gold pool and a two tiered pricing scheme was established whereby gold was still used to settle international accounts at the old per troy ounce g but the price of gold on the private market was allowed to fluctuate this two tiered pricing system was abandoned in when the price of gold was left to find its free market level central banks still hold historical gold reserves as a store of value although the level has generally been declining the largest gold depository in the world is that of the u s federal reserve bank in new york which holds about of the gold known to exist and accounted for today as does the similarly laden u s bullion depository at fort knox in the world gold council estimated total global gold supply to be tonnes and demand to be tonnes giving a surplus of tonnes after august nixon shock the price began to greatly increase and between and the price of gold ranged widely from a high of per troy ounce g on january to a low of per troy ounce g on june london gold fixing prices increased rapidly from but the high was not exceeded until january when a new maximum of per troy ounce was set another record price was set on march at per troy ounce g in late gold markets experienced renewed momentum upwards due to increased demand and a weakening us dollar on december gold reached a new high closing at gold further rallied hitting new highs in may after the european union debt crisis prompted further purchase of gold as a safe asset on march gold hit a new all time high of based on investor concerns regarding ongoing unrest in north africa as well as in the middle east from april to august spot gold prices more than quintupled in value against the us dollar hitting a new all time high of on august prompting speculation that the long secular bear market had ended and a bull market had returned however the price then began a slow decline towards per troy ounce in late and in august the gold price picked up to us per ounce after a complexive growth of from august to october a period during which it outplaced the nasdaq total return of

medicinal applications of gold and its complexes have a long history dating back thousands of years several gold complexes have been applied to treat rheumatoid arthritis the most frequently used being aurothiomalate aurothioglucose and auranofin both gold i and gold iii compounds have been investigated as possible anti cancer drugs for gold iii complexes reduction to gold i under physiological conditions has to be considered stable complexes can be generated using different types of bi tri and tetradentate ligand systems and their efficacy has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo other applications jewelry because of the softness of pure k gold it is usually alloyed with base metals for use in jewelry altering its hardness and ductility melting point color and other properties alloys with lower karat rating typically k k k or k contain higher percentages of copper or other base metals or silver or palladium in the alloy nickel is toxic and its release from nickel white gold is controlled by legislation in europe palladium gold alloys are more expensive than those using nickel high karat white gold alloys are more resistant to corrosion than are either pure silver or sterling silver the japanese craft of mokume gane exploits the color contrasts between laminated colored gold alloys to produce decorative wood grain effects by the gold jewelry industry was escalating despite a dip in gold prices demand in the first quarter of pushed turnover to billion according to a world gold council report gold solder is used for joining the components of gold jewelry by high temperature hard soldering or brazing if the work is to be of hallmarking quality the gold solder alloy must match the fineness purity of the work and alloy formulas are manufactured to color match yellow and white gold gold solder is usually made in at least three melting point ranges referred to as easy medium and hard by using the hard high melting point solder first followed by solders with progressively lower melting points goldsmiths can assemble complex items with several separate soldered joints gold can also be made into thread and used in embroidery electronics only of the world consumption of new gold produced goes to industry but by far the most important industrial use for new gold is in fabrication of corrosion free electrical connectors in computers and other electrical devices for example according to the world gold council a typical cell phone may contain mg of gold worth about dollars cents but since nearly one billion cell phones are produced each year a gold value of us in each phone adds to us billion in gold from just this application prices updated to november though gold is attacked by free chlorine its good conductivity and general resistance to oxidation and corrosion in other environments including resistance to non chlorinated acids has led to its widespread industrial use in the electronic era as a thin layer coating on electrical connectors thereby ensuring good connection for example gold is used in the connectors of the more expensive electronics cables such as audio video and usb cables the benefit of using gold over other connector metals such as tin in these applications has been debated gold connectors are often criticized by audio visual experts as unnecessary for most consumers and seen as simply a marketing ploy however the use of gold in other applications in electronic sliding contacts in highly humid or corrosive atmospheres and in use for contacts with a very high failure cost certain computers communications equipment spacecraft jet aircraft engines remains very common besides sliding electrical contacts gold is also used in electrical contacts because of its resistance to corrosion electrical conductivity ductility and lack of toxicity switch contacts are generally subjected to more intense corrosion stress than are sliding contacts fine gold wires are used to connect semiconductor devices to their packages through a process known as wire bonding the concentration of free electrons in gold metal is cm gold is highly conductive to electricity and has been used for electrical wiring in some high energy applications only silver and copper are more conductive per volume but gold has the advantage of corrosion resistance for example gold electrical wires were used during some of the manhattan project s atomic experiments but large high current silver wires were used in the calutron isotope separator magnets in the project it is estimated that of the world s presently accounted for gold and of the world s silver is contained in electronic technology in japan medicine metallic and gold compounds have long been used for medicinal purposes gold usually as the metal is perhaps the most anciently administered medicine apparently by shamanic practitioners and known to dioscorides in medieval times gold was often seen as beneficial for the health in the belief that something so rare and beautiful could not be anything but healthy even some modern esotericists and forms of alternative medicine assign metallic gold a healing power in the th century gold had a reputation as an anxiolytic a therapy for nervous disorders depression epilepsy migraine and glandular problems such as amenorrhea and impotence were treated and most notably alcoholism keeley the apparent paradox of the actual toxicology of the substance suggests the possibility of serious gaps in the understanding of the action of gold in physiology only salts and radioisotopes of gold are of pharmacological value since elemental metallic gold is inert to all chemicals it encounters inside the body e g ingested gold cannot be attacked by stomach acid some gold salts do have anti inflammatory properties and at present two are still used as pharmaceuticals in the treatment of arthritis and other similar conditions in the us sodium aurothiomalate and auranofin these drugs have been explored as a means to help to reduce the pain and swelling of rheumatoid arthritis and also historically against tuberculosis and some parasites gold alloys are used in restorative dentistry especially in tooth restorations such as crowns and permanent bridges the gold alloys slight malleability facilitates the creation of a superior molar mating surface with other teeth and produces results that are generally more satisfactory than those produced by the creation of porcelain crowns the use of gold crowns in more prominent teeth such as incisors is favored in some cultures and discouraged in others colloidal gold preparations suspensions of gold nanoparticles in water are intensely red colored and can be made with tightly controlled particle sizes up to a few tens of nanometers across by reduction of gold chloride with citrate or ascorbate ions colloidal gold is used in research applications in medicine biology and materials science the technique of immunogold labeling exploits the ability of the gold particles to adsorb protein molecules onto their surfaces colloidal gold particles coated with specific antibodies can be used as probes for the presence and position of antigens on the surfaces of cells in ultrathin sections of tissues viewed by electron microscopy the immunogold labels appear as extremely dense round spots at the position of the antigen gold or alloys of gold and palladium are applied as conductive coating to biological specimens and other non conducting materials such as plastics and glass to be viewed in a scanning electron microscope the coating which is usually applied by sputtering with an argon plasma has a triple role in this application gold s very high electrical conductivity drains electrical charge to earth and its very high density provides stopping power for electrons in the electron beam helping to limit the depth to which the electron beam penetrates the specimen this improves definition of the position and topography of the specimen surface and increases the spatial resolution of the image gold also produces a high output of secondary electrons when irradiated by an electron beam and these low energy electrons are the most commonly used signal source used in the scanning electron microscope the isotope gold half life days is used in nuclear medicine in some cancer treatments and for treating other diseases cuisine gold can be used in food and has the e number in the european food safety authority published an opinion on the re evaluation of gold as a food additive concerns included the possible presence of minute amounts of gold nanoparticles in the food additive and that gold nanoparticles have been shown to be genotoxic in mammalian cells in vitro gold leaf flake or dust is used on and in some gourmet foods notably sweets and drinks as decorative ingredient gold flake was used by the nobility in medieval europe as a decoration in food and drinks in the form of leaf flakes or dust either to demonstrate the host s wealth or in the belief that something that valuable and rare must be beneficial for one s health danziger goldwasser german gold water of danzig or goldwasser english goldwater is a traditional german herbal liqueur produced in what is today gda sk poland and schwabach germany and contains flakes of gold leaf there are also some expensive c cocktails which contain flakes of gold leaf however since metallic gold is inert to all body chemistry it has no taste it provides no nutrition and it leaves the body unaltered vark is a foil composed of a pure metal that is sometimes gold and is used for garnishing sweets in south asian cuisine miscellanea gold produces a deep intense red color when used as a coloring agent in cranberry glass in photography gold toners are used to shift the color of silver bromide black and white prints towards brown or blue tones or to increase their stability used on sepia toned prints gold toners produce red tones kodak published formulas for several types of gold toners which use gold as the chloride gold is a good reflector of electromagnetic radiation such as infrared and visible light as well as radio waves it is used for the protective coatings on many artificial satellites in infrared protective faceplates in thermal protection suits and astronauts helmets and in electronic warfare planes such as the ea b prowler gold is used as the reflective layer on some high end cds automobiles may use gold for heat shielding mclaren uses gold foil in the engine compartment of its f model gold can be manufactured so thin that it appears semi transparent it is used in some aircraft cockpit windows for de icing or anti icing by passing electricity through it the heat produced by the resistance of the gold is enough to prevent ice from forming gold is attacked by and dissolves in alkaline solutions of potassium or sodium cyanide to form the salt gold cyanide a technique that has been used in extracting metallic gold from ores in the cyanide process gold cyanide is the electrolyte used in commercial electroplating of gold onto base metals and electroforming gold chloride chloroauric acid solutions are used to make colloidal gold by reduction with citrate or ascorbate ions gold chloride and gold oxide are used to make cranberry or red colored glass which like colloidal gold suspensions contains evenly sized spherical gold nanoparticles gold when dispersed in nanoparticles can act as a heterogeneous catalyst of chemical reactions toxicity pure metallic elemental gold is non toxic and non irritating when ingested and is sometimes used as a food decoration in the form of gold leaf metallic gold is also a component of the alcoholic drinks goldschl ger gold strike and goldwasser metallic gold is approved as a food additive in the eu e in the codex alimentarius although the gold ion is toxic the acceptance of metallic gold as a food additive is due to its relative chemical inertness and resistance to being corroded or transformed into soluble salts gold compounds by any known chemical process which would be encountered in the human body soluble compounds gold salts such as gold chloride are toxic to the liver and kidneys common cyanide salts of gold such as potassium gold cyanide used in gold electroplating are toxic by virtue of both their cyanide and gold content there are rare cases of lethal gold poisoning from potassium gold cyanide gold toxicity can be ameliorated with chelation therapy with an agent such as dimercaprol gold metal was voted allergen of the year in by the american contact dermatitis society gold contact allergies affect mostly women despite this gold is a relatively non potent contact allergen in comparison with metals like nickel a sample of the fungus aspergillus niger was found growing from gold mining solution and was found to contain cyano metal complexes such as gold silver copper iron and zinc the fungus also plays a role in the solubilization of heavy metal sulfides ,79
Mercury,Hg,mercury is a chemical element with the symbol hg and atomic number it is also known as quicksilver and was formerly named hydrargyrum hy drar j r m from the greek words hydor water and argyros silver a heavy silvery d block element mercury is the only metallic element that is known to be liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is the halogen bromine though metals such as caesium gallium and rubidium melt just above room temperature mercury occurs in deposits throughout the world mostly as cinnabar mercuric sulfide the red pigment vermilion is obtained by grinding natural cinnabar or synthetic mercuric sulfide mercury is used in thermometers barometers manometers sphygmomanometers float valves mercury switches mercury relays fluorescent lamps and other devices though concerns about the element s toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of alternatives such as alcohol or galinstan filled glass thermometers and thermistor or infrared based electronic instruments likewise mechanical pressure gauges and electronic strain gauge sensors have replaced mercury sphygmomanometers mercury remains in use in scientific research applications and in amalgam for dental restoration in some locales it is also used in fluorescent lighting electricity passed through mercury vapor in a fluorescent lamp produces short wave ultraviolet light which then causes the phosphor in the tube to fluoresce making visible light mercury poisoning can result from exposure to water soluble forms of mercury such as mercuric chloride or methylmercury by inhalation of mercury vapor or by ingesting any form of mercury properties physical properties mercury is a heavy silvery white metal that is liquid at room temperature compared to other metals it is a poor conductor of heat but a fair conductor of electricity it has a freezing point of c and a boiling point of c both the lowest of any stable metal although preliminary experiments on copernicium and flerovium have indicated that they have even lower boiling points this effect is due to lanthanide contraction and relativistic contraction reducing the radius of the outermost electrons and thus weakening the metallic bonding in mercury upon freezing the volume of mercury decreases by and its density changes from g cm when liquid to g cm when solid the coefficient of volume expansion is at c at c and at c per c solid mercury is malleable and ductile and can be cut with a knife table of thermal and physical properties of liquid mercury chemical properties mercury does not react with most acids such as dilute sulfuric acid although oxidizing acids such as concentrated sulfuric acid and nitric acid or aqua regia dissolve it to give sulfate nitrate and chloride like silver mercury reacts with atmospheric hydrogen sulfide mercury reacts with solid sulfur flakes which are used in mercury spill kits to absorb mercury spill kits also use activated carbon and powdered zinc amalgams mercury dissolves many metals such as gold and silver to form amalgams iron is an exception and iron flasks have traditionally been used to trade mercury several other first row transition metals with the exception of manganese copper and zinc are also resistant in forming amalgams other elements that do not readily form amalgams with mercury include platinum sodium amalgam is a common reducing agent in organic synthesis and is also used in high pressure sodium lamps mercury readily combines with aluminium to form a mercury aluminium amalgam when the two pure metals come into contact since the amalgam destroys the aluminium oxide layer which protects metallic aluminium from oxidizing in depth as in iron rusting even small amounts of mercury can seriously corrode aluminium for this reason mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances because of the risk of it forming an amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft mercury embrittlement is the most common type of liquid metal embrittlement isotopes there are seven stable isotopes of mercury with hg being the most abundant the longest lived radioisotopes are hg with a half life of years and hg with a half life of days most of the remaining radioisotopes have half lives that are less than a day hg and hg are the most often studied nmr active nuclei having spins of and respectively for the synthesis of precious metals two stable mercury isotopes are of potential interest the trace isotope hg and the more abundant hg both are one neutron removed from hg a radioisotope which decays to au the only known stable isotope of gold however the rarity of hg and the high energy requirements of nuclear reactions knocking out a neutron from hg either via photodisintegration or via a n n reaction involving fast neutrons have thus far ruled out practical application of this real philosopher s stone etymology hg is the modern chemical symbol for mercury it is an abbreviation of hydrargyrum a romanized form of the ancient greek name for mercury hydrargyros hydrargyros is a greek compound word meaning water silver from hydr the root of hydor water and argyros silver like the english name quicksilver living silver this name was due to mercury s liquid and shiny properties the modern english name mercury comes from the planet mercury in medieval alchemy the seven known metals quicksilver gold silver copper iron lead and tin were associated with the seven planets quicksilver was associated with the fastest planet which had been named after the roman god mercury who was associated with speed and mobility the astrological symbol for the planet became one of the alchemical symbols for the metal and mercury became an alternative name for the metal mercury is the only metal for which the alchemical planetary name survives as it was decided it was preferable to quicksilver as a chemical name history mercury was found in egyptian tombs that date from bc in china and tibet mercury use was thought to prolong life heal fractures and maintain generally good health although it is now known that exposure to mercury vapor leads to serious adverse health effects the first emperor of a unified china q n sh hu ng d allegedly buried in a tomb that contained rivers of flowing mercury on a model of the land he ruled representative of the rivers of china was reportedly killed by drinking a mercury and powdered jade mixture formulated by qin alchemists intended as an elixir of immortality khumarawayh ibn ahmad ibn tulun the second tulunid ruler of egypt r known for his extravagance and profligacy reportedly built a basin filled with mercury on which he would lie on top of air filled cushions and be rocked to sleep in november large quantities of mercury were discovered in a chamber feet below the year old pyramid known as the temple of the feathered serpent the third largest pyramid of teotihuacan mexico along with jade statues jaguar remains a box filled with carved shells and rubber balls aristotle recounts that daedalus made a wooden statue of venus move by pouring quicksilver in its interior in greek mythology daedalus gave the appearance of voice in his statues using quicksilver the ancient greeks used cinnabar mercury sulfide in ointments the ancient egyptians and the romans used it in cosmetics in lamanai once a major city of the maya civilization a pool of mercury was found under a marker in a mesoamerican ballcourt by bc mercury was used to make amalgams medieval latin amalgama alloy of mercury with other metals alchemists thought of mercury as the first matter from which all metals were formed they believed that different metals could be produced by varying the quality and quantity of sulfur contained within the mercury the purest of these was gold and mercury was called for in attempts at the transmutation of base or impure metals into gold which was the goal of many alchemists the mines in almad n spain monte amiata italy and idrija now slovenia dominated mercury production from the opening of the mine in almad n years ago until new deposits were found at the end of the th century occurrence mercury is an extremely rare element in earth s crust having an average crustal abundance by mass of only parts per million ppm because it does not blend geochemically with those elements that constitute the majority of the crustal mass mercury ores can be extraordinarily concentrated considering the element s abundance in ordinary rock the richest mercury ores contain up to mercury by mass and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least mercury times average crustal abundance it is found either as a native metal rare or in cinnabar metacinnabar sphalerite corderoite livingstonite and other minerals with cinnabar hgs being the most common ore mercury ores often occur in hot springs or other volcanic regions beginning in with the invention of the patio process to extract silver from ore using mercury mercury became an essential resource in the economy of spain and its american colonies mercury was used to extract silver from the lucrative mines in new spain and peru initially the spanish crown s mines in almad n in southern spain supplied all the mercury for the colonies mercury deposits were discovered in the new world and more than tons of mercury were mined from the region of huancavelica peru over the course of three centuries following the discovery of deposits there in the patio process and later pan amalgamation process continued to create great demand for mercury to treat silver ores until the late th century former mines in italy the united states and mexico which once produced a large proportion of the world supply have now been completely mined out or in the case of slovenia idrija and spain almad n shut down due to the fall of the price of mercury nevada s mcdermitt mine the last mercury mine in the united states closed in the price of mercury has been highly volatile over the years and in was per pound kg flask mercury is extracted by heating cinnabar in a current of air and condensing the vapor the equation for this extraction is hgs o hg so in china was the top producer of mercury with almost two thirds global share followed by kyrgyzstan several other countries are believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes and by recovery from effluents because of the high toxicity of mercury both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning in china prison labor was used by a private mining company as recently as the s to develop new cinnabar mines thousands of prisoners were used by the luo xi mining company to establish new tunnels worker health in functioning mines is at high risk a newspaper claimed that an unidentified european union directive calling for energy efficient lightbulbs to be made mandatory by encouraged china to re open cinnabar mines to obtain the mercury required for cfl bulb manufacture environmental dangers have been a concern particularly in the southern cities of foshan and guangzhou and in guizhou province in the southwest abandoned mercury mine processing sites often contain very hazardous waste piles of roasted cinnabar calcines water run off from such sites is a recognized source of ecological damage former mercury mines may be suited for constructive re use for example in santa clara county california purchased the historic almaden quicksilver mine and created a county park on the site after conducting extensive safety and environmental analysis of the property chemistry all known mercury compounds exhibit one of two positive oxidation states i and ii experiments have failed to unequivocally demonstrate any higher oxidation states both the claimed electrosynthesis of an unstable hg iii species and cryogenic isolation of hgf have disputed interpretations and remain difficult if not impossible to reproduce compounds of mercury i unlike its lighter neighbors cadmium and zinc mercury usually forms simple stable compounds with metal metal bonds most mercury i compounds are diamagnetic and feature the dimeric cation hg stable derivatives include the chloride and nitrate treatment of hg i compounds complexation with strong ligands such as sulfide cyanide etc induces disproportionation to hg and elemental mercury mercury i chloride a colorless solid also known as calomel is really the compound with the formula hg cl with the connectivity cl hg hg cl it is a standard in electrochemistry it reacts with chlorine to give mercuric chloride which resists further oxidation mercury i hydride a colorless gas has the formula hgh containing no hg hg bond indicative of its tendency to bond to itself mercury forms mercury polycations which consist of linear chains of mercury centers capped with a positive charge one example is hg asf compounds of mercury ii mercury ii is the most common oxidation state and is the main one in nature as well all four mercuric halides are known they form tetrahedral complexes with other ligands but the halides adopt linear coordination geometry somewhat like ag does best known is mercury ii chloride an easily sublimating white solid hgcl forms coordination complexes that are typically tetrahedral e g hgcl mercury ii oxide the main oxide of mercury arises when the metal is exposed to air for long periods at elevated temperatures it reverts to the elements upon heating near c as was demonstrated by joseph priestley in an early synthesis of pure oxygen hydroxides of mercury are poorly characterized as they are for its neighbors gold and silver being a soft metal mercury forms very stable derivatives with the heavier chalcogens preeminent is mercury ii sulfide hgs which occurs in nature as the ore cinnabar and is the brilliant pigment vermillion like zns hgs crystallizes in two forms the reddish cubic form and the black zinc blende form the latter sometimes occurs naturally as metacinnabar mercury ii selenide hgse and mercury ii telluride hgte are also known these as well as various derivatives e g mercury cadmium telluride and mercury zinc telluride being semiconductors useful as infrared detector materials mercury ii salts form a variety of complex derivatives with ammonia these include millon s base hg n the one dimensional polymer salts of hgnh n and fusible white precipitate or hg nh cl known as nessler s reagent potassium tetraiodomercurate ii hgi is still occasionally used to test for ammonia owing to its tendency to form the deeply colored iodide salt of millon s base mercury fulminate is a detonator widely used in explosives organomercury compounds organic mercury compounds are historically important but are of little industrial value in the western world mercury ii salts are a rare example of simple metal complexes that react directly with aromatic rings organomercury compounds are always divalent and usually two coordinate and linear geometry unlike organocadmium and organozinc compounds organomercury compounds do not react with water they usually have the formula hgr which are often volatile or hgrx which are often solids where r is aryl or alkyl and x is usually halide or acetate methylmercury a generic term for compounds with the formula ch hgx is a dangerous family of compounds that are often found in polluted water they arise by a process known as biomethylation applications mercury is used primarily for the manufacture of industrial chemicals or for electrical and electronic applications it is used in some liquid in glass thermometers especially those used to measure high temperatures a still increasing amount is used as gaseous mercury in fluorescent lamps while most of the other applications are slowly being phased out due to health and safety regulations in some applications mercury is replaced with less toxic but considerably more expensive galinstan alloy medicine mercury and its compounds have been used in medicine although they are much less common today than they once were now that the toxic effects of mercury and its compounds are more widely understood an example of the early therapeutic application of mercury of was published in by james lind the first edition of the merck s manual featured many mercuric compounds such as mercury is an ingredient in dental amalgams thiomersal called thimerosal in the united states is an organic compound used as a preservative in vaccines though this use is in decline thiomersal is metabolized to ethyl mercury although it was widely speculated that this mercury based preservative could cause or trigger autism in children scientific studies showed no evidence supporting any such link nevertheless thiomersal has been removed from or reduced to trace amounts in all u s vaccines recommended for children years of age and under with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine another mercury compound merbromin mercurochrome is a topical antiseptic used for minor cuts and scrapes that is still in use in some countries mercury in the form of one of its common ores cinnabar is used in various traditional medicines especially in traditional chinese medicine review of its safety has found that cinnabar can lead to significant mercury intoxication when heated consumed in overdose or taken long term and can have adverse effects at therapeutic doses though effects from therapeutic doses are typically reversible although this form of mercury appears to be less toxic than other forms its use in traditional chinese medicine has not yet been justified as the therapeutic basis for the use of cinnabar is not clear today the use of mercury in medicine has greatly declined in all respects especially in developed countries thermometers and sphygmomanometers containing mercury were invented in the early th and late th centuries respectively in the early st century their use is declining and has been banned in some countries states and medical institutions in the u s senate passed legislation to phase out the sale of non prescription mercury thermometers in washington and maine became the first states to ban mercury blood pressure devices mercury compounds are found in some over the counter drugs including topical antiseptics stimulant laxatives diaper rash ointment eye drops and nasal sprays the fda has inadequate data to establish general recognition of the safety and effectiveness of the mercury ingredients in these products mercury is still used in some diuretics although substitutes now exist for most therapeutic uses production of chlorine and caustic soda chlorine is produced from sodium chloride common salt nacl using electrolysis to separate the metallic sodium from the chlorine gas usually the salt is dissolved in water to produce a brine by products of any such chloralkali process are hydrogen h and sodium hydroxide naoh which is commonly called caustic soda or lye by far the largest use of mercury in the late th century was in the mercury cell process also called the castner kellner process where metallic sodium is formed as an amalgam at a cathode made from mercury this sodium is then reacted with water to produce sodium hydroxide many of the industrial mercury releases of the th century came from this process although modern plants claimed to be safe in this regard after about all new chloralkali production facilities that were built in the united states used membrane cell or diaphragm cell technologies to produce chlorine laboratory uses some medical thermometers especially those for high temperatures are filled with mercury they are gradually disappearing in the united states non prescription sale of mercury fever thermometers has been banned since some transit telescopes use a basin of mercury to form a flat and absolutely horizontal mirror useful in determining an absolute vertical or perpendicular reference concave horizontal parabolic mirrors may be formed by rotating liquid mercury on a disk the parabolic form of the liquid thus formed reflecting and focusing incident light such liquid mirror telescopes are cheaper than conventional large mirror telescopes by up to a factor of but the mirror cannot be tilted and always points straight up liquid mercury is a part of popular secondary reference electrode called the calomel electrode in electrochemistry as an alternative to the standard hydrogen electrode the calomel electrode is used to work out the electrode potential of half cells last but not least the triple point of mercury c is a fixed point used as a temperature standard for the international temperature scale its in polarography both the dropping mercury electrode and the hanging mercury drop electrode use elemental mercury this use allows a new uncontaminated electrode to be available for each measurement or each new experiment mercury containing compounds are also of use in the field of structural biology mercuric compounds such as mercury ii chloride or potassium tetraiodomercurate ii can be added to protein crystals in an effort to create heavy atom derivatives that can be used to solve the phase problem in x ray crystallography via isomorphous replacement or anomalous scattering methods niche uses gaseous mercury is used in mercury vapor lamps and some neon sign type advertising signs and fluorescent lamps those low pressure lamps emit very spectrally narrow lines which are traditionally used in optical spectroscopy for calibration of spectral position commercial calibration lamps are sold for this purpose reflecting a fluorescent ceiling light into a spectrometer is a common calibration practice gaseous mercury is also found in some electron tubes including ignitrons thyratrons and mercury arc rectifiers it is also used in specialist medical care lamps for skin tanning and disinfection gaseous mercury is added to cold cathode argon filled lamps to increase the ionization and electrical conductivity an argon filled lamp without mercury will have dull spots and will fail to light correctly lighting containing mercury can be bombarded oven pumped only once when added to neon filled tubes the light produced will be inconsistent red blue spots until the initial burning in process is completed eventually it will light a consistent dull off blue color the deep space atomic clock dsac under development by the jet propulsion laboratory utilises mercury in a linear ion trap based clock the novel use of mercury allows very compact atomic clocks with low energy requirements and is therefore ideal for space probes and mars missions cosmetics mercury as thiomersal is widely used in the manufacture of mascara in minnesota became the first state in the united states to ban intentionally added mercury in cosmetics giving it a tougher standard than the federal government a study in geometric mean urine mercury concentration identified a previously unrecognized source of exposure skin care products to inorganic mercury among new york city residents population based biomonitoring also showed that mercury concentration levels are higher in consumers of seafood and fish meals skin whitening mercury is effective as an active ingredient in skin whitening compounds used to depigment skin the minamata convention on mercury limits the concentration of mercury in such whiteners to part per million however as of many commercially sold whitener products continue to exceed that limit and are considered toxic firearms mercury ii fulminate is a primary explosive which is mainly used as a primer of a cartridge in firearms historic uses many historic applications made use of the peculiar physical properties of mercury especially as a dense liquid and a liquid metal quantities of liquid mercury ranging from to grams to oz have been recovered from elite maya tombs ad or ritual caches at six sites this mercury may have been used in bowls as mirrors for divinatory purposes five of these date to the classic period of maya civilization c but one example predated this in islamic spain it was used for filling decorative pools later the american artist alexander calder built a mercury fountain for the spanish pavilion at the world exhibition in paris the fountain is now on display at the fundaci joan mir in barcelona mercury was used inside wobbler lures its heavy liquid form made it useful since the lures made an attractive irregular movement when the mercury moved inside the plug such use was stopped due to environmental concerns but illegal preparation of modern fishing plugs has occurred the fresnel lenses of old lighthouses used to float and rotate in a bath of mercury which acted like a bearing mercury sphygmomanometers blood pressure meter barometers diffusion pumps coulometers and many other laboratory instruments took advantage of mercury s properties as a very dense opaque liquid with a nearly linear thermal expansion as an electrically conductive liquid it was used in mercury switches including home mercury light switches installed prior to tilt switches used in old fire detectors and tilt switches in some home thermostats owing to its acoustic properties mercury was used as the propagation medium in delay line memory devices used in early digital computers of the mid th century experimental mercury vapor turbines were installed to increase the efficiency of fossil fuel electrical power plants the south meadow power plant in hartford ct employed mercury as its working fluid in a binary configuration with a secondary water circuit for a number of years starting in the late s in a drive to improve plant efficiency several other plants were built including the schiller station in portsmouth nh which went online in the idea did not catch on industry wide due to the weight and toxicity of mercury as well as the advent of supercritical steam plants in later years similarly liquid mercury was used as a coolant for some nuclear reactors however sodium is proposed for reactors cooled with liquid metal because the high density of mercury requires much more energy to circulate as coolant mercury was a propellant for early ion engines in electric space propulsion systems advantages were mercury s high molecular weight low ionization energy low dual ionization energy high liquid density and liquid storability at room temperature disadvantages were concerns regarding environmental impact associated with ground testing and concerns about eventual cooling and condensation of some of the propellant on the spacecraft in long duration operations the first spaceflight to use electric propulsion was a mercury fueled ion thruster developed at nasa glenn research center and flown on the space electric rocket test sert spacecraft launched by nasa at its wallops flight facility in the sert flight was followed up by the sert flight in mercury and caesium were preferred propellants for ion engines until hughes research laboratory performed studies finding xenon gas to be a suitable replacement xenon is now the preferred propellant for ion engines as it has a high molecular weight little or no reactivity due to its noble gas nature and has a high liquid density under mild cryogenic storage other applications made use of the chemical properties of mercury the mercury battery is a non rechargeable electrochemical battery a primary cell that was common in the middle of the th century it was used in a wide variety of applications and was available in various sizes particularly button sizes its constant voltage output and long shelf life gave it a niche use for camera light meters and hearing aids the mercury cell was effectively banned in most countries in the s due to concerns about the mercury contaminating landfills mercury was used for preserving wood developing daguerreotypes silvering mirrors anti fouling paints discontinued in herbicides discontinued in interior latex paint handheld maze games cleaning and road leveling devices in cars mercury compounds have been used in antiseptics laxatives antidepressants and in antisyphilitics it was allegedly used by allied spies to sabotage luftwaffe planes a mercury paste was applied to bare aluminium causing the metal to rapidly corrode this would cause structural failures chloralkali process the largest industrial use of mercury during the th century was in electrolysis for separating chlorine and sodium from brine mercury being the anode of the castner kellner process the chlorine was used for bleaching paper hence the location of many of these plants near paper mills while the sodium was used to make sodium hydroxide for soaps and other cleaning products this usage has largely been discontinued replaced with other technologies that utilize membrane cells as electrodes in some types of electrolysis batteries mercury cells sodium hydroxide and chlorine production handheld games catalysts insecticides mercury was once used as a gun barrel bore cleaner from the mid th to the mid th centuries a process called carroting was used in the making of felt hats animal skins were rinsed in an orange solution the term carroting arose from this color of the mercury compound mercuric nitrate hg no h o this process separated the fur from the pelt and matted it together this solution and the vapors it produced were highly toxic the united states public health service banned the use of mercury in the felt industry in december the psychological symptoms associated with mercury poisoning inspired the phrase mad as a hatter lewis carroll s mad hatter in his book alice s adventures in wonderland was a play on words based on the older phrase but the character himself does not exhibit symptoms of mercury poisoning gold and silver mining historically mercury was used extensively in hydraulic gold mining in order to help the gold to sink through the flowing water gravel mixture thin gold particles may form mercury gold amalgam and therefore increase the gold recovery rates large scale use of mercury stopped in the s however mercury is still used in small scale often clandestine gold prospecting it is estimated that metric tons of mercury used in california for placer mining have not been recovered mercury was also used in silver mining historic medicinal uses mercury i chloride also known as calomel or mercurous chloride has been used in traditional medicine as a diuretic topical disinfectant and laxative mercury ii chloride also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate was once used to treat syphilis along with other mercury compounds although it is so toxic that sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat it is also used as a disinfectant blue mass a pill or syrup in which mercury is the main ingredient was prescribed throughout the th century for numerous conditions including constipation depression child bearing and toothaches in the early th century mercury was administered to children yearly as a laxative and dewormer and it was used in teething powders for infants the mercury containing organohalide merbromin sometimes sold as mercurochrome is still widely used but has been banned in some countries such as the u s toxicity and safety mercury and most of its compounds are extremely toxic and must be handled with care in cases of spills involving mercury such as from certain thermometers or fluorescent light bulbs specific cleaning procedures are used to avoid exposure and contain the spill protocols call for physically merging smaller droplets on hard surfaces combining them into a single larger pool for easier removal with an eyedropper or for gently pushing the spill into a disposable container vacuum cleaners and brooms cause greater dispersal of the mercury and should not be used afterwards fine sulfur zinc or some other powder that readily forms an amalgam alloy with mercury at ordinary temperatures is sprinkled over the area before itself being collected and properly disposed of cleaning porous surfaces and clothing is not effective at removing all traces of mercury and it is therefore advised to discard these kinds of items should they be exposed to a mercury spill mercury can be absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes and mercury vapors can be inhaled so containers of mercury are securely sealed to avoid spills and evaporation heating of mercury or of compounds of mercury that may decompose when heated should be carried out with adequate ventilation in order to minimize exposure to mercury vapor the most toxic forms of mercury are its organic compounds such as dimethylmercury and methylmercury mercury can cause both chronic and acute poisoning releases in the environment preindustrial deposition rates of mercury from the atmosphere may be about ng l of ice deposit although that can be considered a natural level of exposure regional or global sources have significant effects volcanic eruptions can increase the atmospheric source by times natural sources such as volcanoes are responsible for approximately half of atmospheric mercury emissions the human generated half can be divided into the following estimated percentages from stationary combustion of which coal fired power plants are the largest aggregate source of u s mercury emissions in this includes power plants fueled with gas where the mercury has not been removed emissions from coal combustion are between one and two orders of magnitude higher than emissions from oil combustion depending on the country from gold production the three largest point sources for mercury emissions in the u s are the three largest gold mines hydrogeochemical release of mercury from gold mine tailings has been accounted as a significant source of atmospheric mercury in eastern canada from non ferrous metal production typically smelters from cement production from waste disposal including municipal and hazardous waste crematoria and sewage sludge incineration from caustic soda production from pig iron and steel production from mercury production mainly for batteries from other sources the above percentages are estimates of the global human caused mercury emissions in excluding biomass burning an important source in some regions recent atmospheric mercury contamination in outdoor urban air was measured at g m a study measured mercury levels in indoor sites chosen to represent a cross section of building types locations and ages in the new york area this study found mercury concentrations significantly elevated over outdoor concentrations at a range of g m the average was g m artificial lakes or reservoirs may be contaminated with mercury due to the absorption by the water of mercury from submerged trees and soil for example williston lake in northern british columbia created by the damming of the peace river in is still sufficiently contaminated with mercury that it is inadvisable to consume fish from the lake permafrost soils have accumulated mercury through atmospheric deposition and permafrost thaw in cryospheric regions is also a mechanism of mercury release into lakes rivers and wetlands mercury also enters into the environment through the improper disposal e g land filling incineration of certain products products containing mercury include auto parts batteries fluorescent bulbs medical products thermometers and thermostats due to health concerns see below toxics use reduction efforts are cutting back or eliminating mercury in such products for example the amount of mercury sold in thermostats in the united states decreased from tons in to tons in most thermometers now use pigmented alcohol instead of mercury mercury thermometers are still occasionally used in the medical field because they are more accurate than alcohol thermometers though both are commonly being replaced by electronic thermometers and less commonly by galinstan thermometers mercury thermometers are still widely used for certain scientific applications because of their greater accuracy and working range historically one of the largest releases was from the colex plant a lithium isotope separation plant at oak ridge tennessee the plant operated in the s and s records are incomplete and unclear but government commissions have estimated that some two million pounds of mercury are unaccounted for a serious industrial disaster was the dumping of waste mercury compounds into minamata bay japan between and it is estimated that over people suffered various deformities severe mercury poisoning symptoms or death from what became known as minamata disease the tobacco plant readily absorbs and accumulates heavy metals such as mercury from the surrounding soil into its leaves these are subsequently inhaled during tobacco smoking while mercury is a constituent of tobacco smoke studies have largely failed to discover a significant correlation between smoking and hg uptake by humans compared to sources such as occupational exposure fish consumption and amalgam tooth fillings sediment contamination sediments within large urban industrial estuaries act as an important sink for point source and diffuse mercury pollution within catchments a study of foreshore sediments from the thames estuary measured total mercury at to mg kg with mean of mg kg and median of mg kg n the highest mercury concentrations were shown to occur in and around the city of london in association with fine grain muds and high total organic carbon content the strong affinity of mercury for carbon rich sediments has also been observed in salt marsh sediments of the river mersey mean of mg kg up to mg kg these concentrations are far higher than those shown in salt marsh river creek sediments of new jersey and mangroves of southern china which exhibit low mercury concentrations of about mg kg occupational exposure due to the health effects of mercury exposure industrial and commercial uses are regulated in many countries the world health organization osha and niosh all treat mercury as an occupational hazard and have established specific occupational exposure limits environmental releases and disposal of mercury are regulated in the u s primarily by the united states environmental protection agency fish fish and shellfish have a natural tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies often in the form of methylmercury a highly toxic organic compound of mercury species of fish that are high on the food chain such as shark swordfish king mackerel bluefin tuna albacore tuna and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others because mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble they primarily accumulate in the viscera although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue mercury presence in fish muscles can be studied using non lethal muscle biopsies mercury present in prey fish accumulates in the predator that consumes them since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury methylmercury concentrations in the fish tissue increase over time thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume this process is called biomagnification mercury poisoning happened this way in minamata japan now called minamata disease cosmetics some facial creams contain dangerous levels of mercury most contain comparatively non toxic inorganic mercury but products containing highly toxic organic mercury have been encountered effects and symptoms of mercury poisoning toxic effects include damage to the brain kidneys and lungs mercury poisoning can result in several diseases including acrodynia pink disease hunter russell syndrome and minamata disease symptoms typically include sensory impairment vision hearing speech disturbed sensation and a lack of coordination the type and degree of symptoms exhibited depend upon the individual toxin the dose and the method and duration of exposure case control studies have shown effects such as tremors impaired cognitive skills and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapor even at low concentrations in the range g m a study has shown that acute exposure hours to calculated elemental mercury levels of to mg m resulted in chest pain dyspnea cough hemoptysis impairment of pulmonary function and evidence of interstitial pneumonitis acute exposure to mercury vapor has been shown to result in profound central nervous system effects including psychotic reactions characterized by delirium hallucinations and suicidal tendency occupational exposure has resulted in broad ranging functional disturbance including erethism irritability excitability excessive shyness and insomnia with continuing exposure a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids lips and tongue long term low level exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism including fatigue irritability loss of memory vivid dreams and depression treatment research on the treatment of mercury poisoning is limited currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators n acetyl d l penicillamine nap british anti lewisite bal dimercapto propanesulfonic acid dmps and dimercaptosuccinic acid dmsa in one small study including construction workers exposed to elemental mercury patients were treated with dmsa and nap chelation therapy with both drugs resulted in the mobilization of a small fraction of the total estimated body mercury dmsa was able to increase the excretion of mercury to a greater extent than nap regulations international countries agreed in the minamata convention on mercury by the united nations environment programme unep to prevent emissions the convention was signed on october united states in the united states the environmental protection agency is charged with regulating and managing mercury contamination several laws give the epa this authority including the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the safe drinking water act additionally the mercury containing and rechargeable battery management act passed in phases out the use of mercury in batteries and provides for the efficient and cost effective disposal of many types of used batteries north america contributed approximately of the total global anthropogenic mercury emissions in the united states clean air act passed in put mercury on a list of toxic pollutants that need to be controlled to the greatest possible extent thus industries that release high concentrations of mercury into the environment agreed to install maximum achievable control technologies mact in march the epa promulgated a regulation that added power plants to the list of sources that should be controlled and instituted a national cap and trade system states were given until november to impose stricter controls but after a legal challenge from several states the regulations were struck down by a federal appeals court on february the rule was deemed not sufficient to protect the health of persons living near coal fired power plants given the negative effects documented in the epa study report to congress of however newer data published in showed that after introduction of the stricter controls mercury declined sharply indicating that the clean air act had its intended impact the epa announced new rules for coal fired power plants on december cement kilns that burn hazardous waste are held to a looser standard than are standard hazardous waste incinerators in the united states and as a result are a disproportionate source of mercury pollution european union in the european union the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment see rohs bans mercury from certain electrical and electronic products and limits the amount of mercury in other products to less than ppm there are restrictions for mercury concentration in packaging the limit is ppm for sum of mercury lead hexavalent chromium and cadmium and batteries the limit is ppm in july the european union also banned mercury in non electrical measuring devices such as thermometers and barometers the ban applies to new devices only and contains exemptions for the health care sector and a two year grace period for manufacturers of barometers norway norway enacted a total ban on the use of mercury in the manufacturing and import export of mercury products effective january in several lakes in norway were found to have a poor state of mercury pollution with an excess of g g of mercury in their sediment in norway s minister of environment development erik solheim said mercury is among the most dangerous environmental toxins satisfactory alternatives to hg in products are available and it is therefore fitting to induce a ban sweden products containing mercury were banned in sweden in denmark in denmark also banned dental mercury amalgam except for molar masticating surface fillings in permanent adult teeth ,80
Thallium,Tl,thallium is a chemical element with the symbol tl and atomic number it is a gray post transition metal that is not found free in nature when isolated thallium resembles tin but discolors when exposed to air chemists william crookes and claude auguste lamy discovered thallium independently in in residues of sulfuric acid production both used the newly developed method of flame spectroscopy in which thallium produces a notable green spectral line thallium from greek thall s meaning green shoot or twig was named by crookes it was isolated by both lamy and crookes in lamy by electrolysis and crookes by precipitation and melting of the resultant powder crookes exhibited it as a powder precipitated by zinc at the international exhibition which opened on may that year thallium tends to form the and oxidation states the state resembles that of the other elements in group boron aluminium gallium indium however the state which is far more prominent in thallium than the elements above it recalls the chemistry of alkali metals and thallium i ions are found geologically mostly in potassium based ores and when ingested are handled in many ways like potassium ions k by ion pumps in living cells commercially thallium is produced not from potassium ores but as a byproduct from refining of heavy metal sulfide ores approximately of thallium production is used in the electronics industry and the remainder is used in the pharmaceutical industry and in glass manufacturing it is also used in infrared detectors the radioisotope thallium as the soluble chloride tlcl is used in small amounts as an agent in a nuclear medicine scan during one type of nuclear cardiac stress test soluble thallium salts many of which are nearly tasteless are highly toxic and they were historically used in rat poisons and insecticides because of their nonselective toxicity use of these compounds has been restricted or banned in many countries thallium poisoning usually results in hair loss because of its historic popularity as a murder weapon thallium has gained notoriety as the poisoner s poison and inheritance powder alongside arsenic characteristics a thallium atom has electrons arranged in the electron configuration xe f d s p of these the three outermost electrons in the sixth shell are valence electrons due to the inert pair effect the s electron pair is relativistically stabilised and it is more difficult to get these involved in chemical bonding than it is for the heavier elements thus very few electrons are available for metallic bonding similar to the neighboring elements mercury and lead thallium then like its congeners is a soft highly electrically conducting metal with a low melting point of c a number of standard electrode potentials depending on the reaction under study are reported for thallium reflecting the greatly decreased stability of the oxidation state thallium is the first element in group where the reduction of the oxidation state to the oxidation state is spontaneous under standard conditions since bond energies decrease down the group with thallium the energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining the state is not always enough to outweigh the energy needed to involve the s electrons accordingly thallium i oxide and hydroxide are more basic and thallium iii oxide and hydroxide are more acidic showing that thallium conforms to the general rule of elements being more electropositive in their lower oxidation states thallium is malleable and sectile enough to be cut with a knife at room temperature it has a metallic luster that when exposed to air quickly tarnishes to a bluish gray tinge resembling lead it may be preserved by immersion in oil a heavy layer of oxide builds up on thallium if left in air in the presence of water thallium hydroxide is formed sulfuric and nitric acids dissolve thallium rapidly to make the sulfate and nitrate salts while hydrochloric acid forms an insoluble thallium i chloride layer isotopes thallium has isotopes which have atomic masses that range from to tl and tl are the only stable isotopes and make up nearly all of natural thallium tl is the most stable radioisotope with a half life of years it is made by the neutron activation of stable thallium in a nuclear reactor the most useful radioisotope tl half life hours decays by electron capture emitting x rays kev and photons of and kev in total abundance therefore it has good imaging characteristics without an excessive patient radiation dose it is the most popular isotope used for thallium nuclear cardiac stress tests compounds thallium iii thallium iii compounds resemble the corresponding aluminium iii compounds they are moderately strong oxidizing agents and are usually unstable as illustrated by the positive reduction potential for the tl tl couple some mixed valence compounds are also known such as tl o and tlcl which contain both thallium i and thallium iii thallium iii oxide tl o is a black solid which decomposes above c forming the thallium i oxide and oxygen the simplest possible thallium compound thallane tlh is too unstable to exist in bulk both due to the instability of the oxidation state as well as poor overlap of the valence s and p orbitals of thallium with the s orbital of hydrogen the trihalides are more stable although they are chemically distinct from those of the lighter group elements and are still the least stable in the whole group for instance thallium iii fluoride tlf has the bif structure rather than that of the lighter group trifluorides and does not form the tlf complex anion in aqueous solution the trichloride and tribromide disproportionate just above room temperature to give the monohalides and thallium triiodide contains the linear triiodide anion i and is actually a thallium i compound thallium iii sesquichalcogenides do not exist thallium i the thallium i halides are stable in keeping with the large size of the tl cation the chloride and bromide have the caesium chloride structure while the fluoride and iodide have distorted sodium chloride structures like the analogous silver compounds tlcl tlbr and tli are photosensitive and display poor solubility in water the stability of thallium i compounds demonstrates its differences from the rest of the group a stable oxide hydroxide and carbonate are known as are many chalcogenides the double salt tl oh co has been shown to have hydroxyl centred triangles of thallium tl oh as a recurring motif throughout its solid structure the metalorganic compound thallium ethoxide tloet tloc h is a heavy liquid g cm m p c often used as a basic and soluble thallium source in organic and organometallic chemistry organothallium compounds organothallium compounds tend to be thermally unstable in concordance with the trend of decreasing thermal stability down group the chemical reactivity of the tl c bond is also the lowest in the group especially for ionic compounds of the type r tlx thallium forms the stable tl ch ion in aqueous solution like the isoelectronic hg ch and pb ch it is linear trimethylthallium and triethylthallium are like the corresponding gallium and indium compounds flammable liquids with low melting points like indium thallium cyclopentadienyl compounds contain thallium i in contrast to gallium iii history thallium greek thallos meaning a green shoot or twig was discovered by william crookes and claude auguste lamy working independently both using flame spectroscopy crookes was first to publish his findings on march the name comes from thallium s bright green spectral emission lines after the publication of the improved method of flame spectroscopy by robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff and the discovery of caesium and rubidium in the years to flame spectroscopy became an approved method to determine the composition of minerals and chemical products crookes and lamy both started to use the new method crookes used it to make spectroscopic determinations for tellurium on selenium compounds deposited in the lead chamber of a sulfuric acid production plant near tilkerode in the harz mountains he had obtained the samples for his research on selenium cyanide from august hofmann years earlier by crookes was able to isolate small quantities of the new element and determine the properties of a few compounds claude auguste lamy used a spectrometer that was similar to crookes to determine the composition of a selenium containing substance which was deposited during the production of sulfuric acid from pyrite he also noticed the new green line in the spectra and concluded that a new element was present lamy had received this material from the sulfuric acid plant of his friend fr d ric kuhlmann and this by product was available in large quantities lamy started to isolate the new element from that source the fact that lamy was able to work ample quantities of thallium enabled him to determine the properties of several compounds and in addition he prepared a small ingot of metallic thallium which he prepared by remelting thallium he had obtained by electrolysis of thallium salts as both scientists discovered thallium independently and a large part of the work especially the isolation of the metallic thallium was done by lamy crookes tried to secure his own priority on the work lamy was awarded a medal at the international exhibition in london for the discovery of a new and abundant source of thallium and after heavy protest crookes also received a medal thallium for the discovery of the new element the controversy between both scientists continued through and most of the discussion ended after crookes was elected fellow of the royal society in june the dominant use of thallium was the use as poison for rodents after several accidents the use as poison was banned in the united states by presidential executive order in february in subsequent years several other countries also banned its use occurrence and production although thallium is a modestly abundant element in the earth s crust with a concentration estimated to be mg kg mostly in association with potassium based minerals in clays soils and granites thallium is not generally economically recoverable from these sources the major source of thallium for practical purposes is the trace amount that is found in copper lead zinc and other heavy metal sulfide ores thallium is found in the minerals crookesite tlcu se hutchinsonite tlpbas s and lor ndite tlass thallium also occurs as a trace element in iron pyrite and thallium is extracted as a by product of roasting this mineral for the production of sulfuric acid thallium can also be obtained from the smelting of lead and zinc ores manganese nodules found on the ocean floor contain some thallium but the collection of these nodules has been prohibitively expensive there is also the potential for damaging the oceanic environment in addition several other thallium minerals containing to thallium occur in nature as complexes of sulfides or selenides that primarily contain antimony arsenic copper lead and silver these minerals are rare and have had no commercial importance as sources of thallium the allchar deposit in southern north macedonia was the only area where thallium was actively mined this deposit still contains an estimated tonnes of thallium and it is a source for several rare thallium minerals for example lor ndite the united states geological survey usgs estimates that the annual worldwide production of thallium is metric tonnes as a by product from the smelting of copper zinc and lead ores thallium is either extracted from the dusts from the smelter flues or from residues such as slag that are collected at the end of the smelting process the raw materials used for thallium production contain large amounts of other materials and therefore a purification is the first step the thallium is leached either by the use of a base or sulfuric acid from the material the thallium is precipitated several times from the solution to remove impurities at the end it is converted to thallium sulfate and the thallium is extracted by electrolysis on platinum or stainless steel plates the production of thallium decreased by about in the period from to from about metric tonnes to about tonnes since there are several small deposits or ores with relatively high thallium content it would be possible to increase the production if a new application such as a thallium containing high temperature superconductor becomes practical for widespread use outside of the laboratory applications historic uses the odorless and tasteless thallium sulfate was once widely used as rat poison and ant killer since this use has been prohibited in the united states due to safety concerns many other countries followed this example thallium salts were used in the treatment of ringworm other skin infections and to reduce the night sweating of tuberculosis patients this use has been limited due to their narrow therapeutic index and the development of improved medicines for these conditions optics thallium i bromide and thallium i iodide crystals have been used as infrared optical materials because they are harder than other common infrared optics and because they have transmission at significantly longer wavelengths the trade name krs refers to this material thallium i oxide has been used to manufacture glasses that have a high index of refraction combined with sulfur or selenium and arsenic thallium has been used in the production of high density glasses that have low melting points in the range of and celsius these glasses have room temperature properties that are similar to ordinary glasses and are durable insoluble in water and have unique refractive indices electronics thallium i sulfide s electrical conductivity changes with exposure to infrared light making this compound useful in photoresistors thallium selenide has been used in bolometers for infrared detection doping selenium semiconductors with thallium improves their performance thus it is used in trace amounts in selenium rectifiers another application of thallium doping is the sodium iodide crystals in gamma radiation detection devices in these the sodium iodide crystals are doped with a small amount of thallium to improve their efficiency as scintillation generators some of the electrodes in dissolved oxygen analyzers contain thallium high temperature superconductivity research activity with thallium is ongoing to develop high temperature superconducting materials for such applications as magnetic resonance imaging storage of magnetic energy magnetic propulsion and electric power generation and transmission the research in applications started after the discovery of the first thallium barium calcium copper oxide superconductor in thallium cuprate superconductors have been discovered that have transition temperatures above k some mercury doped thallium cuprate superconductors have transition temperatures above k at ambient pressure nearly as high as the world record holding mercury cuprates nuclear medicine before the widespread application of technetium m in nuclear medicine the radioactive isotope thallium with a half life of hours was the main substance for nuclear cardiography the nuclide is still used for stress tests for risk stratification in patients with coronary artery disease cad this isotope of thallium can be generated using a transportable generator which is similar to the technetium m generator the generator contains lead half life hours which decays by electron capture to thallium the lead can be produced in a cyclotron by the bombardment of thallium with protons or deuterons by the p n and d n reactions thallium stress test a thallium stress test is a form of scintigraphy in which the amount of thallium in tissues correlates with tissue blood supply viable cardiac cells have normal na k ion exchange pumps the tl cation binds the k pumps and is transported into the cells exercise or dipyridamole induces widening vasodilation of arteries in the body this produces coronary steal by areas where arteries are maximally dilated areas of infarct or ischemic tissue will remain cold pre and post stress thallium may indicate areas that will benefit from myocardial revascularization redistribution indicates the existence of coronary steal and the presence of ischemic coronary artery disease other uses a mercury thallium alloy which forms a eutectic at thallium is reported to freeze at c some c below the freezing point of mercury this alloy is used in thermometers and low temperature switches in organic synthesis thallium iii salts as thallium trinitrate or triacetate are useful reagents for performing different transformations in aromatics ketones and olefins among others thallium is a constituent of the alloy in the anode plates of magnesium seawater batteries soluble thallium salts are added to gold plating baths to increase the speed of plating and to reduce grain size within the gold layer a saturated solution of equal parts of thallium i formate tl cho and thallium i malonate tl c h o in water is known as clerici solution it is a mobile odorless liquid which changes from yellowish to colorless upon reducing the concentration of the thallium salts with a density of g cm at c clerici solution is one of the heaviest aqueous solutions known it was used in the th century for measuring the density of minerals by the flotation method but its use has discontinued due to the high toxicity and corrosiveness of the solution thallium iodide is frequently used as an additive in metal halide lamps often together with one or two halides of other metals it allows optimization of the lamp temperature and color rendering and shifts the spectral output to the green region which is useful for underwater lighting toxicity thallium and its compounds are extremely toxic with numerous recorded cases of fatal thallium poisoning the occupational safety and health administration osha has set the legal limit permissible exposure limit for thallium exposure in the workplace as mg m skin exposure over an eight hour workday the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh also set a recommended exposure limit rel of mg m skin exposure over an eight hour workday at levels of mg m thallium is immediately dangerous to life and health contact with skin is dangerous and adequate ventilation is necessary when melting this metal thallium i compounds have a high aqueous solubility and are readily absorbed through the skin and care should be taken to avoid this route of exposure as cutaneous absorption can exceed the absorbed dose received by inhalation at the permissible exposure limit pel exposure by inhalation cannot safely exceed mg m in an eight hour time weighted average hour work week the centers for disease control and prevention cdc states thallium is not classifiable as a carcinogen and it is not suspected to be a carcinogen it is unknown whether chronic or repeated exposure to thallium increases the risk of reproductive toxicity or developmental toxicity chronic high level exposure to thallium through inhalation has been reported to cause nervous system effects such as numbness of fingers and toes for a long time thallium compounds were readily available as rat poison this fact and that it is water soluble and nearly tasteless led to frequent intoxication caused by accident or criminal intent one of the main methods of removing thallium both radioactive and stable from humans is to use prussian blue a material which absorbs thallium up to grams per day of prussian blue is fed by mouth to the patient and it passes through their digestive system and comes out in their stool hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are also used to remove thallium from the blood serum at later stages of the treatment additional potassium is used to mobilize thallium from the tissues according to the united states environmental protection agency epa artificially made sources of thallium pollution include gaseous emission of cement factories coal burning power plants and metal sewers the main source of elevated thallium concentrations in water is the leaching of thallium from ore processing operations ,81
Lead,Pb,lead is a chemical element with the symbol pb from the latin plumbum and atomic number it is a heavy metal that is denser than most common materials lead is soft and malleable and also has a relatively low melting point when freshly cut lead is a shiny gray with a hint of blue it tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element and three of its isotopes are endpoints of major nuclear decay chains of heavier elements lead is toxic even in small amounts especially to children lead is a relatively unreactive post transition metal its weak metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature lead and lead oxides react with acids and bases and it tends to form covalent bonds compounds of lead are usually found in the oxidation state rather than the state common with lighter members of the carbon group exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds like the lighter members of the group lead tends to bond with itself it can form chains and polyhedral structures since lead is easily extracted from its ores prehistoric people in the near east were aware of it galena is a principal ore of lead which often bears silver interest in silver helped initiate widespread extraction and use of lead in ancient rome lead production declined after the fall of rome and did not reach comparable levels until the industrial revolution lead played a crucial role in the development of the printing press as movable type could be relatively easily cast from lead alloys in the annual global production of lead was about ten million tonnes over half of which was from recycling lead s high density low melting point ductility and relative inertness to oxidation make it useful these properties combined with its relative abundance and low cost resulted in its extensive use in construction plumbing batteries bullets and shot weights solders pewters fusible alloys white paints leaded gasoline and radiation shielding lead s toxicity became widely recognized in the late th century although a number of well educated ancient greek and roman writers were aware of this fact and even knew some of the symptoms of lead poisoning lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissues and bones it damages the nervous system and interferes with the function of biological enzymes causing neurological disorders ranging from behavioral problems to brain damage and also affects general health cardiovascular and renal systems physical properties atomic a lead atom has electrons arranged in an electron configuration of xe f d s p the sum of lead s first and second ionization energies the total energy required to remove the two p electrons is close to that of tin lead s upper neighbor in the carbon group this is unusual ionization energies generally fall going down a group as an element s outer electrons become more distant from the nucleus and more shielded by smaller orbitals the similarity of ionization energies is caused by the lanthanide contraction the decrease in element radii from lanthanum atomic number to lutetium and the relatively small radii of the elements from hafnium onwards this is due to poor shielding of the nucleus by the lanthanide f electrons the sum of the first four ionization energies of lead exceeds that of tin contrary to what periodic trends would predict relativistic effects which become significant in heavier atoms contribute to this behavior one such effect is the inert pair effect the s electrons of lead become reluctant to participate in bonding making the distance between nearest atoms in crystalline lead unusually long lead s lighter carbon group congeners form stable or metastable allotropes with the tetrahedrally coordinated and covalently bonded diamond cubic structure the energy levels of their outer s and p orbitals are close enough to allow mixing into four hybrid sp orbitals in lead the inert pair effect increases the separation between its s and p orbitals and the gap cannot be overcome by the energy that would be released by extra bonds following hybridization rather than having a diamond cubic structure lead forms metallic bonds in which only the p electrons are delocalized and shared between the pb ions lead consequently has a face centered cubic structure like the similarly sized divalent metals calcium and strontium bulk pure lead has a bright shiny gray appearance with a hint of blue it tarnishes on contact with moist air and takes on a dull appearance the hue of which depends on the prevailing conditions characteristic properties of lead include high density malleability ductility and high resistance to corrosion due to passivation lead s close packed face centered cubic structure and high atomic weight result in a density of g cm which is greater than that of common metals such as iron g cm copper g cm and zinc g cm this density is the origin of the idiom to go over like a lead balloon some rarer metals are denser tungsten and gold are both at g cm and osmium the densest metal known has a density of g cm almost twice that of lead lead is a very soft metal with a mohs hardness of it can be scratched with a fingernail it is quite malleable and somewhat ductile the bulk modulus of lead a measure of its ease of compressibility is gpa in comparison that of aluminium is gpa copper gpa and mild steel gpa lead s tensile strength at mpa is low that of aluminium is times higher copper times and mild steel times higher it can be strengthened by adding small amounts of copper or antimony the melting point of lead at c f is very low compared to most metals its boiling point of c f is the lowest among the carbon group elements the electrical resistivity of lead at c is nanoohm meters almost an order of magnitude higher than those of other industrial metals copper at n m gold n m and aluminium at n m lead is a superconductor at temperatures lower than k this is the highest critical temperature of all type i superconductors and the third highest of the elemental superconductors isotopes natural lead consists of four stable isotopes with mass numbers of and and traces of five short lived radioisotopes the high number of isotopes is consistent with lead s atomic number being even lead has a magic number of protons for which the nuclear shell model accurately predicts an especially stable nucleus lead has neutrons another magic number which may explain why lead is extraordinarily stable with its high atomic number lead is the heaviest element whose natural isotopes are regarded as stable lead is the heaviest stable nucleus this distinction formerly fell to bismuth with an atomic number of until its only primordial isotope bismuth was found in to decay very slowly the four stable isotopes of lead could theoretically undergo alpha decay to isotopes of mercury with a release of energy but this has not been observed for any of them their predicted half lives range from to years at least times the current age of the universe three of the stable isotopes are found in three of the four major decay chains lead lead and lead are the final decay products of uranium uranium and thorium respectively these decay chains are called the uranium chain the actinium chain and the thorium chain their isotopic concentrations in a natural rock sample depends greatly on the presence of these three parent uranium and thorium isotopes for example the relative abundance of lead can range from in normal samples to in thorium ores for this reason the standard atomic weight of lead is given to only one decimal place as time passes the ratio of lead and lead to lead increases since the former two are supplemented by radioactive decay of heavier elements while the latter is not this allows for lead lead dating as uranium decays into lead their relative amounts change this is the basis for uranium lead dating lead exhibits nuclear magnetic resonance a property that has been used to study its compounds in solution and solid state including in human body apart from the stable isotopes which make up almost all lead that exists naturally there are trace quantities of a few radioactive isotopes one of them is lead although it has a half life of only years small quantities occur in nature because lead is produced by a long decay series that starts with uranium that has been present for billions of years on earth lead and are present in the decay chains of uranium thorium and uranium respectively so traces of all three of these lead isotopes are found naturally minute traces of lead arise from the very rare cluster decay of radium one of the daughter products of natural uranium and the decay chain of neptunium traces of which are produced by neutron capture in uranium ores lead is particularly useful for helping to identify the ages of samples by measuring its ratio to lead both isotopes are present in a single decay chain in total lead isotopes have been synthesized with mass numbers lead is the most stable radioisotope with a half life of around years the second most stable is lead which has a half life of about years longer than any of the natural trace radioisotopes chemistry bulk lead exposed to moist air forms a protective layer of varying composition lead ii carbonate is a common constituent the sulfate or chloride may also be present in urban or maritime settings this layer makes bulk lead effectively chemically inert in the air finely powdered lead as with many metals is pyrophoric and burns with a bluish white flame fluorine reacts with lead at room temperature forming lead ii fluoride the reaction with chlorine is similar but requires heating as the resulting chloride layer diminishes the reactivity of the elements molten lead reacts with the chalcogens to give lead ii chalcogenides lead metal resists sulfuric and phosphoric acid but not hydrochloric or nitric acid the outcome depends on insolubility and subsequent passivation of the product salt organic acids such as acetic acid dissolve lead in the presence of oxygen concentrated alkalis will dissolve lead and form plumbites inorganic compounds lead shows two main oxidation states and the tetravalent state is common for the carbon group the divalent state is rare for carbon and silicon minor for germanium important but not prevailing for tin and is the more important of the two oxidation states for lead this is attributable to relativistic effects specifically the inert pair effect which manifests itself when there is a large difference in electronegativity between lead and oxide halide or nitride anions leading to a significant partial positive charge on lead the result is a stronger contraction of the lead s orbital than is the case for the p orbital making it rather inert in ionic compounds the inert pair effect is less applicable to compounds in which lead forms covalent bonds with elements of similar electronegativity such as carbon in organolead compounds in these the s and p orbitals remain similarly sized and sp hybridization is still energetically favorable lead like carbon is predominantly tetravalent in such compounds there is a relatively large difference in the electronegativity of lead ii at and lead iv at this difference marks the reversal in the trend of increasing stability of the oxidation state going down the carbon group tin by comparison has values of in the oxidation state and in the state lead ii lead ii compounds are characteristic of the inorganic chemistry of lead even strong oxidizing agents like fluorine and chlorine react with lead to give only pbf and pbcl lead ii ions are usually colorless in solution and partially hydrolyze to form pb oh and finally pb oh in which the hydroxyl ions act as bridging ligands but are not reducing agents as tin ii ions are techniques for identifying the presence of the pb ion in water generally rely on the precipitation of lead ii chloride using dilute hydrochloric acid as the chloride salt is sparingly soluble in water in very dilute solutions the precipitation of lead ii sulfide is instead achieved by bubbling hydrogen sulfide through the solution lead monoxide exists in two polymorphs litharge pbo red and massicot pbo yellow the latter being stable only above around c litharge is the most commonly used inorganic compound of lead there is no lead ii hydroxide increasing the ph of solutions of lead ii salts leads to hydrolysis and condensation lead commonly reacts with heavier chalcogens lead sulfide is a semiconductor a photoconductor and an extremely sensitive infrared radiation detector the other two chalcogenides lead selenide and lead telluride are likewise photoconducting they are unusual in that their color becomes lighter going down the group lead dihalides are well characterized this includes the diastatide and mixed halides such as pbfcl the relative insolubility of the latter forms a useful basis for the gravimetric determination of fluorine the difluoride was the first solid ionically conducting compound to be discovered in by michael faraday the other dihalides decompose on exposure to ultraviolet or visible light especially the diiodide many lead ii pseudohalides are known such as the cyanide cyanate and thiocyanate lead ii forms an extensive variety of halide coordination complexes such as pbcl pbcl and the pb cl n n chain anion lead ii sulfate is insoluble in water like the sulfates of other heavy divalent cations lead ii nitrate and lead ii acetate are very soluble and this is exploited in the synthesis of other lead compounds lead iv few inorganic lead iv compounds are known they are only formed in highly oxidizing solutions and do not normally exist under standard conditions lead ii oxide gives a mixed oxide on further oxidation pb o it is described as lead ii iv oxide or structurally pbo pbo and is the best known mixed valence lead compound lead dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing hydrochloric acid to chlorine gas this is because the expected pbcl that would be produced is unstable and spontaneously decomposes to pbcl and cl analogously to lead monoxide lead dioxide is capable of forming plumbate anions lead disulfide and lead diselenide are only stable at high pressures lead tetrafluoride a yellow crystalline powder is stable but less so than the difluoride lead tetrachloride a yellow oil decomposes at room temperature lead tetrabromide is less stable still and the existence of lead tetraiodide is questionable other oxidation states some lead compounds exist in formal oxidation states other than or lead iii may be obtained as an intermediate between lead ii and lead iv in larger organolead complexes this oxidation state is not stable as both the lead iii ion and the larger complexes containing it are radicals the same applies for lead i which can be found in such radical species numerous mixed lead ii iv oxides are known when pbo is heated in air it becomes pb o at c pb o at c pb o at c and finally pbo at c a further sesquioxide pb o can be obtained at high pressure along with several non stoichiometric phases many of them show defective fluorite structures in which some oxygen atoms are replaced by vacancies pbo can be considered as having such a structure with every alternate layer of oxygen atoms absent negative oxidation states can occur as zintl phases as either free lead anions as in ba pb with lead formally being lead iv or in oxygen sensitive ring shaped or polyhedral cluster ions such as the trigonal bipyramidal pb ion where two lead atoms are lead i and three are lead in such anions each atom is at a polyhedral vertex and contributes two electrons to each covalent bond along an edge from their sp hybrid orbitals the other two being an external lone pair they may be made in liquid ammonia via the reduction of lead by sodium organolead lead can form multiply bonded chains a property it shares with its lighter homologs in the carbon group its capacity to do so is much less because the pb pb bond energy is over three and a half times lower than that of the c c bond with itself lead can build metal metal bonds of an order up to three with carbon lead forms organolead compounds similar to but generally less stable than typical organic compounds due to the pb c bond being rather weak this makes the organometallic chemistry of lead far less wide ranging than that of tin lead predominantly forms organolead iv compounds even when starting with inorganic lead ii reactants very few organolead ii compounds are known the most well characterized exceptions are pb ch sime and pb c h the lead analog of the simplest organic compound methane is plumbane plumbane may be obtained in a reaction between metallic lead and atomic hydrogen two simple derivatives tetramethyllead and tetraethyllead are the best known organolead compounds these compounds are relatively stable tetraethyllead only starts to decompose if heated or if exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet light with sodium metal lead readily forms an equimolar alloy that reacts with alkyl halides to form organometallic compounds such as tetraethyllead the oxidizing nature of many organolead compounds is usefully exploited lead tetraacetate is an important laboratory reagent for oxidation in organic synthesis tetraethyllead once added to gasoline was produced in larger quantities than any other organometallic compound other organolead compounds are less chemically stable for many organic compounds a lead analog does not exist origin and occurrence in space lead s per particle abundance in the solar system is ppb parts per billion this figure is two and a half times higher than that of platinum eight times more than mercury and seventeen times more than gold the amount of lead in the universe is slowly increasing as most heavier atoms all of which are unstable gradually decay to lead the abundance of lead in the solar system since its formation billion years ago has increased by about the solar system abundances table shows that lead despite its relatively high atomic number is more prevalent than most other elements with atomic numbers greater than primordial lead which comprises the isotopes lead lead lead and lead was mostly created as a result of repetitive neutron capture processes occurring in stars the two main modes of capture are the s and r processes in the s process s is for slow captures are separated by years or decades allowing less stable nuclei to undergo beta decay a stable thallium nucleus can capture a neutron and become thallium this undergoes beta decay to give stable lead on capturing another neutron it becomes lead which has a half life of around million years further captures result in lead lead and lead on capturing another neutron lead becomes lead which quickly decays into bismuth bismuth is also radioactive and eventually decays into thallium if left unperturbed on capturing another neutron bismuth becomes bismuth and this beta decays to polonium which alpha decays to lead the cycle hence ends at lead lead lead and thallium in the r process r is for rapid captures happen faster than nuclei can decay this occurs in environments with a high neutron density such as a supernova or the merger of two neutron stars the neutron flux involved may be on the order of neutrons per square centimeter per second the r process does not form as much lead as the s process it tends to stop once neutron rich nuclei reach neutrons at this point the neutrons are arranged in complete shells in the atomic nucleus and it becomes harder to energetically accommodate more of them when the neutron flux subsides these nuclei beta decay into stable isotopes of osmium iridium and platinum on earth lead is classified as a chalcophile under the goldschmidt classification meaning it is generally found combined with sulfur it rarely occurs in its native metallic form many lead minerals are relatively light and over the course of the earth s history have remained in the crust instead of sinking deeper into the earth s interior this accounts for lead s relatively high crustal abundance of ppm it is the th most abundant element in the crust the main lead bearing mineral is galena pbs which is mostly found with zinc ores most other lead minerals are related to galena in some way boulangerite pb sb s is a mixed sulfide derived from galena anglesite pbso is a product of galena oxidation and cerussite or white lead ore pbco is a decomposition product of galena arsenic tin antimony silver gold copper and bismuth are common impurities in lead minerals world lead resources exceed two billion tons significant deposits are located in australia china ireland mexico peru portugal russia and the united states global reserves resources that are economically feasible to extract totaled million tons in of which australia had million china million and russia million typical background concentrations of lead do not exceed g m in the atmosphere mg kg in soil mg kg in vegetation and g l in freshwater and seawater etymology the modern english word lead is of germanic origin it comes from the middle english leed and old english l ad with the macron above the e signifying that the vowel sound of that letter is long the old english word is derived from the hypothetical reconstructed proto germanic lauda lead according to linguistic theory this word bore descendants in multiple germanic languages of exactly the same meaning there is no consensus on the origin of the proto germanic lauda one hypothesis suggests it is derived from proto indo european laudh lead capitalization of the vowel is equivalent to the macron another hypothesis suggests it is borrowed from proto celtic loud io lead this word is related to the latin plumbum which gave the element its chemical symbol pb the word loud io is thought to be the origin of proto germanic bliwa which also means lead from which stemmed the german blei the name of the chemical element is not related to the verb of the same spelling which is derived from proto germanic laidijan to lead history prehistory and early history metallic lead beads dating back to bce have been found in asia minor and may represent the first example of metal smelting at that time lead had few if any applications due to its softness and dull appearance the major reason for the spread of lead production was its association with silver which may be obtained by burning galena a common lead mineral the ancient egyptians were the first to use lead minerals in cosmetics an application that spread to ancient greece and beyond the egyptians may have used lead for sinkers in fishing nets glazes glasses enamels and for ornaments various civilizations of the fertile crescent used lead as a writing material as coins and as a construction material lead was used in the ancient chinese royal court as a stimulant as currency and as a contraceptive the indus valley civilization and the mesoamericans used it for making amulets and the eastern and southern african peoples used lead in wire drawing classical era because silver was extensively used as a decorative material and an exchange medium lead deposits came to be worked in asia minor from bce later lead deposits were developed in the aegean and laurion these three regions collectively dominated production of mined lead until c bce beginning circa bce the phoenicians worked deposits in the iberian peninsula by bce lead mining existed in cyprus greece and sardinia rome s territorial expansion in europe and across the mediterranean and its development of mining led to it becoming the greatest producer of lead during the classical era with an estimated annual output peaking at tonnes like their predecessors the romans obtained lead mostly as a by product of silver smelting lead mining occurred in central europe britain the balkans greece anatolia and hispania the latter accounting for of world production lead tablets were commonly used as a material for letters lead coffins cast in flat sand forms with interchangeable motifs to suit the faith of the deceased were used in ancient judea lead was used to make sling bullets from the th century bc in roman times lead sling bullets were amply used and were effective at a distance of between and meters the balearic slingers used as mercenaries in carthaginian and roman armies were famous for their shooting distance and accuracy lead was used for making water pipes in the roman empire the latin word for the metal plumbum is the origin of the english word plumbing its ease of working its low melting point enabling the easy fabrication of completely waterproof welded joints and its resistance to corrosion ensured its widespread use in other applications including pharmaceuticals roofing currency and warfare writers of the time such as cato the elder columella and pliny the elder recommended lead or lead coated vessels for the preparation of sweeteners and preservatives added to wine and food the lead conferred an agreeable taste due to the formation of sugar of lead lead ii acetate whereas copper or bronze vessels could impart a bitter flavor through verdigris formation the roman author vitruvius reported the health dangers of lead and modern writers have suggested that lead poisoning played a major role in the decline of the roman empire other researchers have criticized such claims pointing out for instance that not all abdominal pain is caused by lead poisoning according to archaeological research roman lead pipes increased lead levels in tap water but such an effect was unlikely to have been truly harmful when lead poisoning did occur victims were called saturnine dark and cynical after the ghoulish father of the gods saturn by association lead was considered the father of all metals its status in roman society was low as it was readily available and cheap confusion with tin and antimony since the bronze age metallurgists and engineers have understood the difference between rare and valuable tin essential for alloying with copper to produce tough and corrosion resistant bronze and cheap and cheerful lead however the nomenclature in some languages is similar romans called lead plumbum nigrum black lead and tin plumbum candidum bright lead the association of lead and tin can be seen in other languages the word olovo in czech translates to lead but in russian its cognate olovo means tin to add to the confusion lead bore a close relation to antimony both elements commonly occur as sulfides galena and stibnite often together pliny incorrectly wrote that stibnite would give lead on heating instead of antimony in countries such as turkey and india the originally persian name surma came to refer to either antimony sulfide or lead sulfide and in some languages such as russian gave its name to antimony middle ages and the renaissance lead mining in western europe declined after the fall of the western roman empire with arabian iberia being the only region having a significant output the largest production of lead occurred in south and east asia especially china and india where lead mining grew rapidly in europe lead production began to increase in the th and th centuries when it was again used for roofing and piping starting in the th century lead was used to create stained glass in the european and arabian traditions of alchemy lead symbol in the european tradition was considered an impure base metal which by the separation purification and balancing of its constituent essences could be transformed to pure and incorruptible gold during the period lead was used increasingly for adulterating wine the use of such wine was forbidden for use in christian rites by a papal bull in but it continued to be imbibed and resulted in mass poisonings up to the late th century lead was a key material in parts of the printing press and lead dust was commonly inhaled by print workers causing lead poisoning lead also became the chief material for making bullets for firearms it was cheap less damaging to iron gun barrels had a higher density which allowed for better retention of velocity and its lower melting point made the production of bullets easier as they could be made using a wood fire lead in the form of venetian ceruse was extensively used in cosmetics by western european aristocracy as whitened faces were regarded as a sign of modesty this practice later expanded to white wigs and eyeliners and only faded out with the french revolution in the late th century a similar fashion appeared in japan in the th century with the emergence of the geishas a practice that continued long into the th century the white faces of women came to represent their feminine virtue as japanese women with lead commonly used in the whitener outside europe and asia in the new world lead production was recorded soon after the arrival of european settlers the earliest record dates to in the english colony of virginia fourteen years after its foundation in australia the first mine opened by colonists on the continent was a lead mine in in africa lead mining and smelting were known in the benue trough and the lower congo basin where lead was used for trade with europeans and as a currency by the th century well before the scramble for africa industrial revolution in the second half of the th century britain and later continental europe and the united states experienced the industrial revolution this was the first time during which lead production rates exceeded those of rome britain was the leading producer losing this status by the mid th century with the depletion of its mines and the development of lead mining in germany spain and the united states by the united states was the leader in global lead production and other non european nations canada mexico and australia had begun significant production production outside europe exceeded that within a great share of the demand for lead came from plumbing and painting lead paints were in regular use at this time more working class people were exposed to the metal and lead poisoning cases escalated this led to research into the effects of lead intake lead was proven to be more dangerous in its fume form than as a solid metal lead poisoning and gout were linked british physician alfred baring garrod noted a third of his gout patients were plumbers and painters the effects of chronic ingestion of lead including mental disorders were also studied in the th century the first laws aimed at decreasing lead poisoning in factories were enacted during the s and s in the united kingdom modern era further evidence of the threat that lead posed to humans was discovered in the late th and early th centuries mechanisms of harm were better understood lead blindness was documented and the element was phased out of public use in the united states and europe the united kingdom introduced mandatory factory inspections in and appointed the first medical inspector of factories in as a result a fold decrease in lead poisoning incidents from to was reported most european countries banned lead paint commonly used because of its opacity and water resistance for interiors by the last major human exposure to lead was the addition of tetraethyllead to gasoline as an antiknock agent a practice that originated in the united states in it was phased out in the united states and the european union by in the s the united states and western european countries introduced legislation to reduce lead air pollution the impact was significant while a study conducted by the centers for disease control and prevention in the united states in showed that of the population had elevated blood lead levels in a study by the same institute showed the share of people with such high levels dropped to the main product made of lead by the end of the th century was the lead acid battery from to lead output in the western bloc grew by about the share of the world s lead production by the eastern bloc increased from to from to with the soviet union being the world s largest producer during the mid s and the s and china starting major lead production in the late th century unlike the european communist countries china was largely unindustrialized by the mid th century in china surpassed australia as the largest producer of lead as was the case during european industrialization lead has had a negative effect on health in china production as of production of lead is increasing worldwide due to its use in lead acid batteries there are two major categories of production primary from mined ores and secondary from scrap in million metric tons came from primary production and million from secondary production the top three producers of mined lead concentrate in that year were china australia and the united states the top three producers of refined lead were china the united states and india according to the international resource panel s metal stocks in society report of the total amount of lead in use stockpiled discarded or dissipated into the environment on a global basis is kg per capita much of this is in more developed countries kg per capita rather than less developed ones kg per capita the primary and secondary lead production processes are similar some primary production plants now supplement their operations with scrap lead and this trend is likely to increase in the future given adequate techniques lead obtained via secondary processes is indistinguishable from lead obtained via primary processes scrap lead from the building trade is usually fairly clean and is re melted without the need for smelting though refining is sometimes needed secondary lead production is therefore cheaper in terms of energy requirements than is primary production often by or more primary most lead ores contain a low percentage of lead rich ores have a typical content of which must be concentrated for extraction during initial processing ores typically undergo crushing dense medium separation grinding froth flotation and drying the resulting concentrate which has a lead content of by mass regularly is then turned into impure lead metal there are two main ways of doing this a two stage process involving roasting followed by blast furnace extraction carried out in separate vessels or a direct process in which the extraction of the concentrate occurs in a single vessel the latter has become the most common route though the former is still significant two stage process first the sulfide concentrate is roasted in air to oxidize the lead sulfide pbs s o g pbo s so g as the original concentrate was not pure lead sulfide roasting yields not only the desired lead ii oxide but a mixture of oxides sulfates and silicates of lead and of the other metals contained in the ore this impure lead oxide is reduced in a coke fired blast furnace to the again impure metal pbo s c s pb s co g impurities are mostly arsenic antimony bismuth zinc copper silver and gold typically they are removed in a series of pyrometallurgical processes the melt is treated in a reverberatory furnace with air steam and sulfur which oxidizes the impurities except for silver gold and bismuth oxidized contaminants float to the top of the melt and are skimmed off metallic silver and gold are removed and recovered economically by means of the parkes process in which zinc is added to lead zinc which is immiscible in lead dissolves the silver and gold the zinc solution can be separated from the lead and the silver and gold retrieved de silvered lead is freed of bismuth by the betterton kroll process treating it with metallic calcium and magnesium the resulting bismuth dross can be skimmed off alternatively to the pyrometallurgical processes very pure lead can be obtained by processing smelted lead electrolytically using the betts process anodes of impure lead and cathodes of pure lead are placed in an electrolyte of lead fluorosilicate pbsif once electrical potential is applied impure lead at the anode dissolves and plates onto the cathode leaving the majority of the impurities in solution this is a high cost process and thus mostly reserved for refining bullion containing high percentages of impurities direct process in this process lead bullion and slag is obtained directly from lead concentrates the lead sulfide concentrate is melted in a furnace and oxidized forming lead monoxide carbon as coke or coal gas is added to the molten charge along with fluxing agents the lead monoxide is thereby reduced to metallic lead in the midst of a slag rich in lead monoxide if the input is rich in lead as much as of the original lead can be obtained as bullion the remaining forms a slag rich in lead monoxide for a low grade feed all of the lead can be oxidized to a high lead slag metallic lead is further obtained from the high lead slags via submerged fuel combustion or injection reduction assisted by an electric furnace or a combination of both alternatives research on a cleaner less energy intensive lead extraction process continues a major drawback is that either too much lead is lost as waste or the alternatives result in a high sulfur content in the resulting lead metal hydrometallurgical extraction in which anodes of impure lead are immersed into an electrolyte and pure lead is deposited electrowound onto a cathode is a technique that may have potential but is not currently economical except in cases where electricity is very cheap secondary smelting which is an essential part of the primary production is often skipped during secondary production it is only performed when metallic lead has undergone significant oxidation the process is similar to that of primary production in either a blast furnace or a rotary furnace with the essential difference being the greater variability of yields blast furnaces produce hard lead antimony while reverberatory and rotary kiln furnaces produced semisoft lead antimony the isasmelt process is a more recent smelting method that may act as an extension to primary production battery paste from spent lead acid batteries containing lead sulfate and lead oxides has its sulfate removed by treating it with alkali and is then treated in a coal fueled furnace in the presence of oxygen which yields impure lead with antimony the most common impurity refining of secondary lead is similar to that of primary lead some refining processes may be skipped depending on the material recycled and its potential contamination of the sources of lead for recycling lead acid batteries are the most important lead pipe sheet and cable sheathing are also significant applications contrary to popular belief pencil leads in wooden pencils have never been made from lead when the pencil originated as a wrapped graphite writing tool the particular type of graphite used was named plumbago literally act for lead or lead mockup elemental form lead metal has several useful mechanical properties including high density low melting point ductility and relative inertness many metals are superior to lead in some of these aspects but are generally less common and more difficult to extract from parent ores lead s toxicity has led to its phasing out for some uses lead has been used for bullets since their invention in the middle ages it is inexpensive its low melting point means small arms ammunition and shotgun pellets can be cast with minimal technical equipment and it is denser than other common metals which allows for better retention of velocity it remains the main material for bullets alloyed with other metals as hardeners concerns have been raised that lead bullets used for hunting can damage the environment lead s high density and resistance to corrosion have been exploited in a number of related applications it is used as ballast in sailboat keels its density allows it to take up a small volume and minimize water resistance thus counterbalancing the heeling effect of wind on the sails it is used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the diver s buoyancy in the base of the leaning tower of pisa was stabilized with tonnes of lead because of its corrosion resistance lead is used as a protective sheath for underwater cables lead has many uses in the construction industry lead sheets are used as architectural metals in roofing material cladding flashing gutters and gutter joints and on roof parapets lead is still used in statues and sculptures including for armatures in the past it was often used to balance the wheels of cars for environmental reasons this use is being phased out in favor of other materials lead is added to copper alloys such as brass and bronze to improve machinability and for its lubricating qualities being practically insoluble in copper the lead forms solid globules in imperfections throughout the alloy such as grain boundaries in low concentrations as well as acting as a lubricant the globules hinder the formation of swarf as the alloy is worked thereby improving machinability copper alloys with larger concentrations of lead are used in bearings the lead provides lubrication and the copper provides the load bearing support lead s high density atomic number and formability form the basis for use of lead as a barrier that absorbs sound vibration and radiation lead has no natural resonance frequencies as a result sheet lead is used as a sound deadening layer in the walls floors and ceilings of sound studios organ pipes are often made from a lead alloy mixed with various amounts of tin to control the tone of each pipe lead is an established shielding material from radiation in nuclear science and in x ray rooms due to its denseness and high attenuation coefficient molten lead has been used as a coolant for lead cooled fast reactors batteries the largest use of lead in the early st century is in lead acid batteries the lead in batteries undergoes no direct contact with humans so there are fewer toxicity concerns people who work in lead battery production plants may be exposed to lead dust and inhale it the reactions in the battery between lead lead dioxide and sulfuric acid provide a reliable source of voltage supercapacitors incorporating lead acid batteries have been installed in kilowatt and megawatt scale applications in australia japan and the united states in frequency regulation solar smoothing and shifting wind smoothing and other applications these batteries have lower energy density and charge discharge efficiency than lithium ion batteries but are significantly cheaper coating for cables lead is used in high voltage power cables as shell material to prevent water diffusion into insulation this use is decreasing as lead is being phased out its use in solder for electronics is also being phased out by some countries to reduce the amount of environmentally hazardous waste lead is one of three metals used in the oddy test for museum materials helping detect organic acids aldehydes and acidic gases compounds in addition to being the main application for lead metal lead acid batteries are also the main consumer of lead compounds the energy storage release reaction used in these devices involves lead sulfate and lead dioxide pb s pbo s h so aq pbso s h o l other applications of lead compounds are very specialized and often fading lead based coloring agents are used in ceramic glazes and glass especially for red and yellow shades while lead paints are phased out in europe and north america they remain in use in less developed countries such as china india or indonesia lead tetraacetate and lead dioxide are used as oxidizing agents in organic chemistry lead is frequently used in the polyvinyl chloride coating of electrical cords it can be used to treat candle wicks to ensure a longer more even burn because of its toxicity european and north american manufacturers use alternatives such as zinc lead glass is composed of lead oxide changing its optical characteristics and reducing the transmission of ionizing radiation a property used in old tvs and computer monitors with cathode ray tubes lead based semiconductors such as lead telluride and lead selenide are used in photovoltaic cells and infrared detectors biological effects lead has no confirmed biological role and there is no confirmed safe level of lead exposure a canadian american study concluded that even at levels that are considered to pose little to no risk lead may cause adverse mental health outcomes its prevalence in the human body at an adult average of mg is nevertheless exceeded only by zinc mg and iron mg among the heavy metals lead salts are very efficiently absorbed by the body a small amount of lead is stored in bones the rest is excreted in urine and feces within a few weeks of exposure only about a third of lead is excreted by a child continual exposure may result in the bioaccumulation of lead toxicity lead is a highly poisonous metal whether inhaled or swallowed affecting almost every organ and system in the human body at airborne levels of mg m it is immediately dangerous to life and health most ingested lead is absorbed into the bloodstream the primary cause of its toxicity is its predilection for interfering with the proper functioning of enzymes it does so by binding to the sulfhydryl groups found on many enzymes or mimicking and displacing other metals which act as cofactors in many enzymatic reactions the essential metals that lead interacts with include calcium iron and zinc high levels of calcium and iron tend to provide some protection from lead poisoning low levels cause increased susceptibility effects lead can cause severe damage to the brain and kidneys and ultimately death by mimicking calcium lead can cross the blood brain barrier it degrades the myelin sheaths of neurons reduces their numbers interferes with neurotransmission routes and decreases neuronal growth in the human body lead inhibits porphobilinogen synthase and ferrochelatase preventing both porphobilinogen formation and the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin ix the final step in heme synthesis this causes ineffective heme synthesis and microcytic anemia symptoms of lead poisoning include nephropathy colic like abdominal pains and possibly weakness in the fingers wrists or ankles small blood pressure increases particularly in middle aged and older people may be apparent and can cause anemia several studies mostly cross sectional found an association between increased lead exposure and decreased heart rate variability in pregnant women high levels of exposure to lead may cause miscarriage chronic high level exposure has been shown to reduce fertility in males in a child s developing brain lead interferes with synapse formation in the cerebral cortex neurochemical development including that of neurotransmitters and the organization of ion channels early childhood exposure has been linked with an increased risk of sleep disturbances and excessive daytime drowsiness in later childhood high blood levels are associated with delayed puberty in girls the rise and fall in exposure to airborne lead from the combustion of tetraethyl lead in gasoline during the th century has been linked with historical increases and decreases in crime levels exposure sources lead exposure is a global issue since lead mining and smelting and battery manufacturing disposal and recycling are common in many countries lead enters the body via inhalation ingestion or skin absorption almost all inhaled lead is absorbed into the body for ingestion the rate is with children absorbing a higher percentage than adults poisoning typically results from ingestion of food or water contaminated with lead and less commonly after accidental ingestion of contaminated soil dust or lead based paint seawater products can contain lead if affected by nearby industrial waters fruit and vegetables can be contaminated by high levels of lead in the soils they were grown in soil can be contaminated through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes lead paint and residual emissions from leaded gasoline the use of lead for water pipes is a problem in areas with soft or acidic water hard water forms insoluble protective layers on the inner surface of the pipes whereas soft and acidic water dissolves the lead pipes dissolved carbon dioxide in the carried water may result in the formation of soluble lead bicarbonate oxygenated water may similarly dissolve lead as lead ii hydroxide drinking such water over time can cause health problems due to the toxicity of the dissolved lead the harder the water the more calcium bicarbonate and sulfate it will contain and the more the inside of the pipes will be coated with a protective layer of lead carbonate or lead sulfate ingestion of applied lead based paint is the major source of exposure for children a direct source is chewing on old painted window sills alternatively as the applied dry paint deteriorates it peels is pulverized into dust and then enters the body through hand to mouth contact or contaminated food water or alcohol ingesting certain home remedies may result in exposure to lead or its compounds inhalation is the second major exposure pathway affecting smokers and especially workers in lead related occupations cigarette smoke contains among other toxic substances radioactive lead as a result of epa s regulatory efforts levels of lead in the air in the united states decreased by percent between and the concentration of lead in the air in the united states fell below the national standard of g m in skin exposure may be significant for people working with organic lead compounds the rate of skin absorption is lower for inorganic lead lead in plastic toys according to the united states center for disease control the use of lead in plastics has not been banned lead softens the plastic and makes it more flexible so that it can go back to its original shape it may also be used in plastic toys to stabilize molecules from heat lead dust can be formed when plastic is exposed to sunlight air and detergents that break down the chemical bond between the lead and plastics treatment treatment for lead poisoning normally involves the administration of dimercaprol and succimer acute cases may require the use of disodium calcium edetate the calcium chelate and the disodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta it has a greater affinity for lead than calcium with the result that lead chelate is formed by exchange and excreted in the urine leaving behind harmless calcium environmental effects the extraction production use and disposal of lead and its products have caused significant contamination of the earth s soils and waters atmospheric emissions of lead were at their peak during the industrial revolution and the leaded gasoline period in the second half of the twentieth century lead releases originate from natural sources i e concentration of the naturally occurring lead industrial production incineration and recycling and mobilization of previously buried lead in particular as lead has been phased out from other uses in the global south lead recycling operations designed to extract cheap lead used for global manufacturing have become a well documented source of exposure elevated concentrations of lead persist in soils and sediments in post industrial and urban areas industrial emissions including those arising from coal burning continue in many parts of the world particularly in the developing countries lead can accumulate in soils especially those with a high organic content where it remains for hundreds to thousands of years environmental lead can compete with other metals found in and on plants surfaces potentially inhibiting photosynthesis and at high enough concentrations negatively affecting plant growth and survival contamination of soils and plants can allow lead to ascend the food chain affecting microorganisms and animals in animals lead exhibits toxicity in many organs damaging the nervous renal reproductive hematopoietic and cardiovascular systems after ingestion inhalation or skin absorption fish uptake lead from both water and sediment bioaccumulation in the food chain poses a hazard to fish birds and sea mammals anthropogenic lead includes lead from shot and sinkers these are among the most potent sources of lead contamination along with lead production sites lead was banned for shot and sinkers in the united states in although that ban was only effective for a month and a similar ban is being considered in the european union analytical methods for the determination of lead in the environment include spectrophotometry x ray fluorescence atomic spectroscopy and electrochemical methods a specific ion selective electrode has been developed based on the ionophore s s methylenebis n n diisobutyldithiocarbamate an important biomarker assay for lead poisoning is aminolevulinic acid levels in plasma serum and urine restriction and remediation by the mid s there was significant decline in the use of lead in industry in the united states environmental regulations reduced or eliminated the use of lead in non battery products including gasoline paints solders and water systems particulate control devices were installed in coal fired power plants to capture lead emissions in u s congress required the environmental protection agency to reduce the blood lead levels of the country s children lead use was further curtailed by the european union s restriction of hazardous substances directive a large drop in lead deposition occurred in the netherlands after the national ban on use of lead shot for hunting and sport shooting from tonnes in to tonnes in in the united states the permissible exposure limit for lead in the workplace comprising metallic lead inorganic lead compounds and lead soaps was set at g m over an hour workday and the blood lead level limit at g per g of blood in lead may still be found in harmful quantities in stoneware vinyl such as that used for tubing and the insulation of electrical cords and chinese brass old houses may still contain lead paint white lead paint has been withdrawn from sale in industrialized countries but specialized uses of other pigments such as yellow lead chromate remain stripping old paint by sanding produces dust which can be inhaled lead abatement programs have been mandated by some authorities in properties where young children live lead waste depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the waste may be treated as household waste to facilitate lead abatement activities or potentially hazardous waste requiring specialized treatment or storage lead is released into the environment in shooting places and a number of lead management practices have been developed to counter the lead contamination lead migration can be enhanced in acidic soils to counter that it is advised soils be treated with lime to neutralize the soils and prevent leaching of lead research has been conducted on how to remove lead from biosystems by biological means fish bones are being researched for their ability to bioremediate lead in contaminated soil the fungus aspergillus versicolor is effective at absorbing lead ions from industrial waste before being released to water bodies several bacteria have been researched for their ability to remove lead from the environment including the sulfate reducing bacteria desulfovibrio and desulfotomaculum both of which are highly effective in aqueous solutions ,82
Bismuth,Bi,bismuth is a chemical element with the symbol bi and atomic number it is a post transition metal and one of the pnictogens with chemical properties resembling its lighter group siblings arsenic and antimony elemental bismuth occurs naturally and its sulfide and oxide forms are important commercial ores the free element is as dense as lead it is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced surface oxidation generally gives samples of the metal a somewhat rosy cast further oxidation under heat can give bismuth a vividly iridescent appearance due to thin film interference bismuth is both the most diamagnetic element and one of the least thermally conductive metals known bismuth was long considered the element with the highest atomic mass whose nuclei do not spontaneously decay however in it was discovered to be extremely weakly radioactive the metal s only primordial isotope bismuth experiences alpha decay at such a minute rate that its half life is more than a billion times the estimated age of the universe for all but the most exotic of uses bismuth may be considered stable because of its tremendously long half life bismuth metal has been known since ancient times before modern analytical methods bismuth s metallurgical similarities to lead and tin often led it to be confused with those metals the etymology of bismuth is uncertain the name may come from mid sixteenth century new latin translations of the german words wei e masse or wismuth meaning white mass which were rendered as bisemutum or bisemutium main uses bismuth compounds account for about half the global production of bismuth they are used in cosmetics pigments and a few pharmaceuticals notably bismuth subsalicylate used to treat diarrhea bismuth s unusual propensity to expand as it solidifies is responsible for some of its uses as in the casting of printing type bismuth has unusually low toxicity for a heavy metal as the toxicity of lead and the cost of its environmental remediation became more apparent during the th century suitable bismuth alloys have gained popularity as replacements for lead presently around a third of global bismuth production is dedicated to needs formerly met by lead history and etymology bismuth metal has been known since ancient times and it was one of the first metals to have been discovered the name bismuth dates to around and is of uncertain etymology the name possibly comes from obsolete german bismuth wismut wissmuth early th century perhaps related to old high german hwiz white the new latin bisemutium coined by georgius agricola who latinized many german mining and technical words is from the german wismuth itself perhaps from wei e masse meaning white mass the element was confused in early times with tin and lead because of its resemblance to those elements because bismuth has been known since ancient times no one person is credited with its discovery agricola states that bismuth is a distinct metal in a family of metals including tin and lead this was based on observation of the metals and their physical properties miners in the age of alchemy also gave bismuth the name tectum argenti or silver being made in the sense of silver still in the process of being formed within the earth bismuth was also known to the incas and used along with the usual copper and tin in a special bronze alloy for knives beginning with johann heinrich pott in carl wilhelm scheele and torbern olof bergman the distinctness of lead and bismuth became clear and claude fran ois geoffroy demonstrated in that this metal is distinct from lead and tin characteristics physical characteristics bismuth is a brittle metal with a dark silver pink hue often with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue the spiral stair stepped structure of bismuth crystals is the result of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges the variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal cause different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection thus displaying a rainbow of colors when burned in oxygen bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes its toxicity is much lower than that of its neighbors in the periodic table such as lead and antimony no other metal is verified to be more naturally diamagnetic than bismuth superdiamagnetism is a different physical phenomenon of any metal it has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity after manganese and maybe neptunium and plutonium and the highest hall coefficient it has a high electrical resistivity when deposited in sufficiently thin layers on a substrate bismuth is a semiconductor despite being a post transition metal elemental bismuth is denser in the liquid phase than the solid a characteristic it shares with germanium silicon gallium and water bismuth expands on solidification therefore it was long a component of low melting typesetting alloys where it compensated for the contraction of the other alloying components to form almost isostatic bismuth lead eutectic alloys though virtually unseen in nature high purity bismuth can form distinctive colorful hopper crystals it is relatively nontoxic and has a low melting point just above c so crystals may be grown using a household stove although the resulting crystals will tend to be of lower quality than lab grown crystals at ambient conditions bismuth shares the same layered structure as the metallic forms of arsenic and antimony crystallizing in the rhombohedral lattice pearson symbol hr space group r m no of the trigonal crystal system when compressed at room temperature this bi i structure changes first to the monoclinic bi ii at gpa then to the tetragonal bi iii at gpa and finally to the body centered cubic bi v at gpa the corresponding transitions can be monitored via changes in electrical conductivity they are rather reproducible and abrupt and are therefore used for calibration of high pressure equipment chemical characteristics bismuth is stable to both dry and moist air at ordinary temperatures when red hot it reacts with water to make bismuth iii oxide bi h o bi o h it reacts with fluorine to make bismuth v fluoride at c or bismuth iii fluoride at lower temperatures typically from bi melts with other halogens it yields only bismuth iii halides the trihalides are corrosive and easily react with moisture forming oxyhalides with the formula biox bi x bix x f cl br i bix o biox x bismuth dissolves in concentrated sulfuric acid to make bismuth iii sulfate and sulfur dioxide h so bi h o bi so so it reacts with nitric acid to make bismuth iii nitrate which decomposes into nitrogen dioxide when heated bi hno h o no bi no it also dissolves in hydrochloric acid but only with oxygen present bi o hcl bicl h oit is used as a transmetalating agent in the synthesis of alkaline earth metal complexes ba biph baph bi isotopes the only primordial isotope of bismuth bismuth was traditionally regarded as the heaviest stable isotope but it had long been suspected to be unstable on theoretical grounds this was finally demonstrated in when researchers at the institut d astrophysique spatiale in orsay france measured the alpha emission half life of bi to be years bq mg over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe owing to its extraordinarily long half life for all presently known medical and industrial applications bismuth can be treated as if it is stable and nonradioactive the radioactivity is of academic interest because bismuth is one of a few elements whose radioactivity was suspected and theoretically predicted before being detected in the laboratory bismuth has the longest known alpha decay half life although tellurium has a double beta decay half life of over years bismuth s extremely long half life means that less than approximately one billionth of the bismuth present at the formation of the planet earth would have decayed into thallium since then several isotopes of bismuth with short half lives occur within the radioactive disintegration chains of actinium radium and thorium and more have been synthesized experimentally bismuth is also found on the decay chain of neptunium and uranium commercially the radioactive isotope bismuth can be produced by bombarding radium with bremsstrahlung photons from a linear particle accelerator in an antibody conjugate with bismuth which has a minute half life and decays with the emission of an alpha particle was used to treat patients with leukemia this isotope has also been tried in cancer treatment for example in the targeted alpha therapy tat program chemical compounds bismuth forms trivalent and pentavalent compounds the trivalent ones being more common many of its chemical properties are similar to those of arsenic and antimony although they are less toxic than derivatives of those lighter elements oxides and sulfides at elevated temperatures the vapors of the metal combine rapidly with oxygen forming the yellow trioxide bi o when molten at temperatures above c this oxide corrodes any metal oxide and even platinum on reaction with a base it forms two series of oxyanions bio which is polymeric and forms linear chains and bio the anion in li bio is a cubic octameric anion bi o whereas the anion in na bio is tetrameric the dark red bismuth v oxide bi o is unstable liberating o gas upon heating the compound nabio is a strong oxidising agent bismuth sulfide bi s occurs naturally in bismuth ores it is also produced by the combination of molten bismuth and sulfur bismuth oxychloride biocl see figure at right and bismuth oxynitrate biono stoichiometrically appear as simple anionic salts of the bismuthyl iii cation bio which commonly occurs in aqueous bismuth compounds however in the case of biocl the salt crystal forms in a structure of alternating plates of bi o and cl atoms with each oxygen coordinating with four bismuth atoms in the adjacent plane this mineral compound is used as a pigment and cosmetic see below bismuthine and bismuthides unlike the lighter pnictogens nitrogen phosphorus and arsenic but similar to antimony bismuth does not form a stable hydride bismuth hydride bismuthine bih is an endothermic compound that spontaneously decomposes at room temperature it is stable only below c bismuthides are intermetallic compounds between bismuth and other metals in researchers discovered that sodium bismuthide can exist as a form of matter called a three dimensional topological dirac semi metal dtds that possess d dirac fermions in bulk it is a natural three dimensional counterpart to graphene with similar electron mobility and velocity graphene and topological insulators such as those in dtds are both crystalline materials that are electrically insulating inside but conducting on the surface allowing them to function as transistors and other electronic devices while sodium bismuthide na bi is too unstable to be used in devices without packaging it can demonstrate potential applications of dtds systems which offer distinct efficiency and fabrication advantages over planar graphene in semiconductor and spintronics applications halides the halides of bismuth in low oxidation states have been shown to adopt unusual structures what was originally thought to be bismuth i chloride bicl turns out to be a complex compound consisting of bi cations and bicl and bi cl anions the bi cation has a distorted tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry and is also found in bi hf cl which is prepared by reducing a mixture of hafnium iv chloride and bismuth chloride with elemental bismuth having the structure bi bi hfcl other polyatomic bismuth cations are also known such as bi found in bi alcl bismuth also forms a low valence bromide with the same structure as bicl there is a true monoiodide bii which contains chains of bi i units bii decomposes upon heating to the triiodide bii and elemental bismuth a monobromide of the same structure also exists in oxidation state bismuth forms trihalides with all of the halogens bif bicl bibr and bii all of these except bif are hydrolyzed by water bismuth iii chloride reacts with hydrogen chloride in ether solution to produce the acid hbicl the oxidation

bif xef xef bif aqueous species in aqueous solution the bi ion is solvated to form the aqua ion bi h o in strongly acidic conditions at ph polynuclear species exist the most important of which is believed to be the octahedral complex bi o oh occurrence and production in the earth s crust bismuth is about twice as abundant as gold the most important ores of bismuth are bismuthinite and bismite native bismuth is known from australia bolivia and china the difference between mining and refining production reflects bismuth s status as a byproduct of extraction of other metals such as lead copper tin molybdenum and tungsten world bismuth production from refineries is a more complete and reliable statistic bismuth travels in crude lead bullion which can contain up to bismuth through several stages of refining until it is removed by the kroll betterton process which separates the impurities as slag or the electrolytic betts process bismuth will behave similarly with another of its major metals copper the raw bismuth metal from both processes contains still considerable amounts of other metals foremost lead by reacting the molten mixture with chlorine gas the metals are converted to their chlorides while bismuth remains unchanged impurities can also be removed by various other methods for example with fluxes and treatments yielding high purity bismuth metal over bi price the price for pure bismuth metal has been relatively stable through most of the th century except for a spike in the s bismuth has always been produced mainly as a byproduct of lead refining and thus the price usually reflected the cost of recovery and the balance between production and demand prior to world war ii demand for bismuth was small and mainly pharmaceutical bismuth compounds were used to treat such conditions as digestive disorders sexually transmitted diseases and burns minor amounts of bismuth metal were consumed in fusible alloys for fire sprinkler systems and fuse wire during world war ii bismuth was considered a strategic material used for solders fusible alloys medications and atomic research to stabilize the market the producers set the price at per pound kg during the war and at per pound kg from until in the early s the price rose rapidly as a result of increasing demand for bismuth as a metallurgical additive to aluminium iron and steel this was followed by a decline owing to increased world production stabilized consumption and the recessions of and in the price began to climb as consumption increased worldwide especially in the united states and japan in the early s research began on the evaluation of bismuth as a nontoxic replacement for lead in ceramic glazes fishing sinkers food processing equipment free machining brasses for plumbing applications lubricating greases and shot for waterfowl hunting growth in these areas remained slow during the middle s in spite of the backing of lead replacement by the united states federal government but intensified around this resulted in a rapid and continuing increase in price recycling most bismuth is produced as a byproduct of other metal extraction processes including the smelting of lead and also of tungsten and copper its sustainability is dependent on increased recycling which is problematic it was once believed that bismuth could be practically recycled from the soldered joints in electronic equipment recent efficiencies in solder application in electronics mean there is substantially less solder deposited and thus less to recycle while recovering the silver from silver bearing solder may remain economic recovering bismuth is substantially less so next in recycling feasibility would be sizeable catalysts with a fair bismuth content such as bismuth phosphomolybdate bismuth used in galvanizing and as a free machining metallurgical additive bismuth in uses where it is dispersed most widely include certain stomach medicines bismuth subsalicylate paints bismuth vanadate pearlescent cosmetics bismuth oxychloride and bismuth containing bullets recycling bismuth from these uses is impractical applications bismuth has few commercial applications and those applications that use it generally require small quantities relative to other raw materials in the united states for example tonnes of bismuth were consumed in of which went into chemicals including pharmaceuticals pigments and cosmetics and into bismuth alloys some manufacturers use bismuth as a substitute in equipment for potable water systems such as valves to meet lead free mandates in the u s began in this is a fairly large application since it covers all residential and commercial building construction in the early s researchers began to evaluate bismuth as a nontoxic replacement for lead in various applications medicines bismuth is an ingredient in some pharmaceuticals although the use of some of these substances is declining bismuth subsalicylate is used as an antidiarrheal it is the active ingredient in such pink bismuth preparations as pepto bismol as well as the reformulation of kaopectate it is also used to treat some other gastro intestinal diseases like shigellosis and cadmium poisoning the mechanism of action of this substance is still not well documented although an oligodynamic effect toxic effect of small doses of heavy metal ions on microbes may be involved in at least some cases salicylic acid from hydrolysis of the compound is antimicrobial for toxogenic e coli an important pathogen in traveler s diarrhea a combination of bismuth subsalicylate and bismuth subcitrate is used to treat the bacteria causing peptic ulcers bibrocathol is an organic bismuth containing compound used to treat eye infections bismuth subgallate the active ingredient in devrom is used as an internal deodorant to treat malodor from flatulence and feces bismuth compounds including sodium bismuth tartrate were formerly used to treat syphilis arsenic combined with either bismuth or mercury was a mainstay of syphilis treatment from the s until the advent of penicillin in milk of bismuth an aqueous suspension of bismuth hydroxide and bismuth subcarbonate was marketed as an alimentary cure all in the early th century and has been used to treat gastrointestinal disorders bismuth subnitrate bi o oh no and bismuth subcarbonate bi o co are also used in medicine cosmetics and pigments bismuth oxychloride biocl is sometimes used in cosmetics as a pigment in paint for eye shadows hair sprays and nail polishes this compound is found as the mineral bismoclite and in crystal form contains layers of atoms see figure above that refract light chromatically resulting in an iridescent appearance similar to nacre of pearl it was used as a cosmetic in ancient egypt and in many places since bismuth white also spanish white can refer to either bismuth oxychloride or bismuth oxynitrate biono when used as a white pigment bismuth vanadate is used as a light stable non reactive paint pigment particularly for artists paints often as a replacement for the more toxic cadmium sulfide yellow and orange yellow pigments the most common variety in artists paints is a lemon yellow visually indistinguishable from its cadmium containing alternative metal and alloys bismuth is used in metal alloys with other metals such as iron these alloys are used in automatic sprinkler systems for fires it forms the largest part of rose s metal a fusible alloy which also contains lead and tin it was also used to make bismuth bronze which was used in the bronze age having been found in inca knives at machu picchu lead replacement the density difference between lead g cm and bismuth g cm is small enough that for many ballistics and weighting applications bismuth can substitute for lead for example it can replace lead as a dense material in fishing sinkers it has been used as a replacement for lead in shot bullets and less lethal riot gun ammunition the netherlands denmark england wales the united states and many other countries now prohibit the use of lead shot for the hunting of wetland birds as many birds are prone to lead poisoning owing to mistaken ingestion of lead instead of small stones and grit to aid digestion or even prohibit the use of lead for all hunting such as in the netherlands bismuth tin alloy shot is one alternative that provides similar ballistic performance to lead another less expensive but also more poorly performing alternative is steel shot which is actually soft iron bismuth s lack of malleability does however make it unsuitable for use in expanding hunting bullets bismuth as a dense element of high atomic weight is used in bismuth impregnated latex shields to shield from x ray in medical examinations such as cts mostly as it is considered non toxic the european union s restriction of hazardous substances directive rohs for reduction of lead has broadened bismuth s use in electronics as a component of low melting point solders as a replacement for traditional tin lead solders its low toxicity will be especially important for solders to be used in food processing equipment and copper water pipes although it can also be used in other applications including those in the automobile industry in the european union for example bismuth has been evaluated as a replacement for lead in free machining brasses for plumbing applications although it does not equal the performance of leaded steels other metal uses and specialty alloys many bismuth alloys have low melting points and are found in specialty applications such as solders many automatic sprinklers electric fuses and safety devices in fire detection and suppression systems contain the eutectic in cd pb sn bi alloy that melts at c f this is a convenient temperature since it is unlikely to be exceeded in normal living conditions low melting alloys such as bi cd pb sn alloy which melts at c are also used in automotive and aviation industries before deforming a thin walled metal part it is filled with a melt or covered with a thin layer of the alloy to reduce the chance of breaking then the alloy is removed by submerging the part in boiling water bismuth is used to make free machining steels and free machining aluminium alloys for precision machining properties it has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining the shrinking on solidification in lead and the expansion of bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities similarly alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change on the order upon melting solidification or aging such alloys are used in high precision casting e g in dentistry to create models and molds bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material bismuth is also used in aluminium silicon cast alloys in order to refine silicon morphology however it indicated a poisoning effect on modification of strontium some bismuth alloys such as bi pb sn are combined with non sticking materials such as mica glass and enamels because they easily wet them allowing to make joints to other parts addition of bismuth to caesium enhances the quantum yield of caesium cathodes sintering of bismuth and manganese powders at c produces a permanent magnet and magnetostrictive material which is used in ultrasonic generators and receivers working in the khz range and in magnetic and holographic memory devices other uses as compounds bismuth is included in bscco bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide which is a group of similar superconducting compounds discovered in that exhibit the highest superconducting transition temperatures bismuth subnitrate is a component of glazes that produces an iridescence and is used as a pigment in paint bismuth telluride is a semiconductor and an excellent thermoelectric material bi te diodes are used in mobile refrigerators cpu coolers and as detectors in infrared spectrophotometers bismuth oxide in its delta form is a solid electrolyte for oxygen this form normally breaks down below a high temperature threshold but can be electrodeposited well below this temperature in a highly alkaline solution bismuth germanate is a scintillator widely used in x ray and gamma ray detectors bismuth vanadate is an opaque yellow pigment used by some artists oil acrylic and watercolor paint companies primarily as a replacement for the more toxic cadmium sulfide yellows in the greenish yellow lemon to orange toned yellow range it performs practically identically to the cadmium pigments such as in terms of resistance to degradation from uv exposure opacity tinting strength and lack of reactivity when mixed with other pigments the most commonly used variety by artists paint makers is lemon in color in addition to being a replacement for several cadmium yellows it also serves as a non toxic visual replacement for the older chromate pigments made with zinc lead and strontium if a green pigment and barium sulfate for increased transparency are added it can also serve as a replacement for barium chromate which possesses a more greenish cast than the others in comparison with lead chromate it does not blacken due to hydrogen sulfide in the air a process accelerated by uv exposure and possesses a particularly brighter color than them especially the lemon which is the most translucent dull and fastest to blacken due to the higher percentage of lead sulfate required to produce that shade it is also used on a limited basis due to its cost as a vehicle paint pigment a catalyst for making acrylic fibers as an electrocatalyst in the conversion of co to co ingredient in lubricating greases in crackling microstars dragon s eggs in pyrotechnics as the oxide subcarbonate or subnitrate as catalyst for the fluorination of arylboronic pinacol esters through a bi iii bi v catalytic cycle mimicking transition metals in electrophilic fluorination toxicology and ecotoxicology see also bismuthia a rare dermatological condition that results from the prolonged use of bismuth scientific literature indicates that some of the compounds of bismuth are less toxic to humans via ingestion than other heavy metals lead arsenic antimony etc presumably due to the comparatively low solubility of bismuth salts its biological half life for whole body retention is reported to be days but it can remain in the kidney for years in people treated with bismuth compounds bismuth poisoning can occur and has according to some reports been common in relatively recent times as with lead bismuth poisoning can result in the formation of a black deposit on the gingiva known as a bismuth line poisoning may be treated with dimercaprol however evidence for benefit is unclear bismuth s environmental impacts are not well known it may be less likely to bioaccumulate than some other heavy metals and this is an area of active research ,83
Polonium,Po,polonium is a chemical element with the symbol po and atomic number polonium is a chalcogen a rare and highly radioactive metal with no stable isotopes polonium is chemically similar to selenium and tellurium though its metallic character resembles that of its horizontal neighbors in the periodic table thallium lead and bismuth due to the short half life of all its isotopes its natural occurrence is limited to tiny traces of the fleeting polonium with a half life of days in uranium ores as it is the penultimate daughter of natural uranium though slightly longer lived isotopes exist they are much more difficult to produce today polonium is usually produced in milligram quantities by the neutron irradiation of bismuth due to its intense radioactivity which results in the radiolysis of chemical bonds and radioactive self heating its chemistry has mostly been investigated on the trace scale only polonium was discovered in july by marie sk odowska curie and pierre curie when it was extracted from the uranium ore pitchblende and identified solely by its strong radioactivity it was the first element to be so discovered polonium was named after marie curie s homeland of poland polonium has few applications and those are related to its radioactivity heaters in space probes antistatic devices sources of neutrons and alpha particles and poison it is extremely dangerous to humans characteristics po is an alpha emitter that has a half life of days it decays directly to its stable daughter isotope pb a milligram curies of po emits about as many alpha particles per second as grams of ra which means it s times more radioactive than radium a few curies curie equals gigabecquerels ci gbq of po emit a blue glow which is caused by ionisation of the surrounding air about one in alpha emissions causes an excitation in the nucleus which then results in the emission of a gamma ray with a maximum energy of kev solid state form polonium is a radioactive element that exists in two metallic allotropes the alpha form is the only known example of a simple cubic crystal structure in a single atom basis at stp with an edge length of picometers the beta form is rhombohedral the structure of polonium has been characterized by x ray diffraction and electron diffraction po in common with pu has the ability to become airborne with ease if a sample is heated in air to c f of it is vaporized in hours to form diatomic po molecules even though the melting point of polonium is c f and its boiling point is c f more than one hypothesis exists for how polonium does this one suggestion is that small clusters of polonium atoms are spalled off by the alpha decay chemistry the chemistry of polonium is similar to that of tellurium although it also shows some similarities to its neighbor bismuth due to its metallic character polonium dissolves readily in dilute acids but is only slightly soluble in alkalis polonium solutions are first colored in pink by the po ions but then rapidly become yellow because alpha radiation from polonium ionizes the solvent and converts po into po as polonium also emits alpha particles after disintegration so this process is accompanied by bubbling and emission of heat and light by glassware due to the absorbed alpha particles as a result polonium solutions are volatile and will evaporate within days unless sealed at ph about polonium ions are readily hydrolyzed and complexed by acids such as oxalic acid citric acid and tartaric acid compounds polonium has no common compounds and almost all of its compounds are synthetically created more than of those are known the most stable class of polonium compounds are polonides which are prepared by direct reaction of two elements na po has the antifluorite structure the polonides of ca ba hg pb and lanthanides form a nacl lattice bepo and cdpo have the wurtzite and mgpo the nickel arsenide structure most polonides decompose upon heating to about c except for hgpo that decomposes at c and the lanthanide polonides which do not decompose but melt at temperatures above c for example the polonide of praseodymium prpo melts at c and that of thulium tmpo melts at c pbpo is one of the very few naturally occurring polonium compounds as polonium alpha decays to form lead polonium hydride poh is a volatile liquid at room temperature prone to dissociation it is thermally unstable water is the only other known hydrogen chalcogenide which is a liquid at room temperature however this is due to hydrogen bonding the three oxides poo poo and poo are the products of oxidation of polonium halides of the structure pox pox and pof are known they are soluble in the corresponding hydrogen halides i e poclx in hcl pobrx in hbr and poi in hi polonium dihalides are formed by direct reaction of the elements or by reduction of pocl with so and with pobr with h s at room temperature tetrahalides can be obtained by reacting polonium dioxide with hcl hbr or hi other polonium compounds include potassium polonite as a polonite polonate acetate bromate carbonate citrate chromate cyanide formate ii and iv hydroxides nitrate selenate selenite monosulfide sulfate disulfate and sulfite a limited organopolonium chemistry is known mostly restricted to dialkyl and diaryl polonides r po triarylpolonium halides ar pox and diarylpolonium dihalides ar pox polonium also forms soluble compounds with some chelating agents such as butanediol and thiourea isotopes polonium has known isotopes all of which are radioactive they have atomic masses that range from to u po half life days is the most widely available and is made via neutron capture by natural bismuth the longer lived po half life years longest lived of all polonium isotopes and po half life years can be made through the alpha proton or deuteron bombardment of lead or bismuth in a cyclotron history tentatively called radium f polonium was discovered by marie and pierre curie in july and was named after marie curie s native land of poland latin polonia poland at the time was under russian german and austro hungarian partition and did not exist as an independent country it was curie s hope that naming the element after her native land would publicize its lack of independence polonium may be the first element named to highlight a political controversy this element was the first one discovered by the curies while they were investigating the cause of pitchblende radioactivity pitchblende after removal of the radioactive elements uranium and thorium was more radioactive than the uranium and thorium combined this spurred the curies to search for additional radioactive elements they first separated out polonium from pitchblende in july and five months later also isolated radium german scientist willy marckwald successfully isolated milligrams of polonium in though at the time he believed it was a new element which he dubbed radio tellurium and it was not until that it was demonstrated to be the same as polonium in the united states polonium was produced as part of the manhattan project s dayton project during world war ii polonium and beryllium were the key ingredients of the urchin initiator at the center of the bomb s spherical pit urchin initiated the nuclear chain reaction at the moment of prompt criticality to ensure that the weapon did not fizzle urchin was used in early u s weapons subsequent u s weapons utilized a pulse neutron generator for the same purpose much of the basic physics of polonium was classified until after the war the fact that it was used as an initiator was classified until the s the atomic energy commission and the manhattan project funded human experiments using polonium on five people at the university of rochester between and the people were administered between and microcuries and kbq of polonium to study its excretion occurrence and production polonium is a very rare element in nature because of the short half lives of all its isotopes seven isotopes occur in traces as decay products po po and po occur in the decay chain of u po and po occur in the decay chain of u po and po occur in the decay chain of th of these po is the only isotope with a half life longer than minutes polonium can be found in uranium ores at about mg per metric ton part in which is approximately of the abundance of radium the amounts in the earth s crust are not harmful polonium has been found in tobacco smoke from tobacco leaves grown with phosphate fertilizers because it is present in small concentrations isolation of polonium from natural sources is a tedious process the largest batch of the element ever extracted performed in the first half of the th century contained only ci tbq mg of polonium and was obtained by processing tonnes of residues from radium production polonium is now usually obtained by irradiating bismuth with high energy neutrons or protons in an experiment showed that when natural bi is bombarded with neutrons bi is created which then decays to po via beta minus decay the final purification is done pyrochemically followed by liquid liquid extraction techniques polonium may now be made in milligram amounts in this procedure which uses high neutron fluxes found in nuclear reactors only about grams are produced each year practically all of it in russia making polonium exceedingly rare this process can cause problems in lead bismuth based liquid metal cooled nuclear reactors such as those used in the soviet navy s k measures must be taken in these reactors to deal with the unwanted possibility of po being released from the coolant the longer lived isotopes of polonium po and po can be formed by proton or deuteron bombardment of bismuth using a cyclotron other more neutron deficient and more unstable isotopes can be formed by the irradiation of platinum with carbon nuclei applications polonium based sources of alpha particles were produced in the former soviet union such sources were applied for measuring the thickness of industrial coatings via attenuation of alpha radiation because of intense alpha radiation a one gram sample of po will spontaneously heat up to above c f generating about watts of power therefore po is used as an atomic heat source to power radioisotope thermoelectric generators via thermoelectric materials for example po heat sources were used in the lunokhod and lunokhod moon rovers to keep their internal components warm during the lunar nights as well as the kosmos and satellites the alpha particles emitted by polonium can be converted to neutrons using beryllium oxide at a rate of neutrons per million alpha particles po beo mixtures are used as passive neutron sources with a gamma ray to neutron production ratio of lower than for nuclear fission based neutron sources examples of po beo mixtures or alloys used as neutron sources are a neutron trigger or initiator for nuclear weapons and for inspections of oil wells about sources of this type with an individual activity of ci tbq had been used annually in the soviet union polonium was also part of brushes or more complex tools that eliminate static charges in photographic plates textile mills paper rolls sheet plastics and on substrates such as automotive prior to the application of coatings alpha particles emitted by polonium ionize air molecules that neutralize charges on the nearby surfaces some anti static brushes contain up to microcuries mbq of po as a source of charged particles for neutralizing static electricity in the us devices with no more than ci mbq of sealed po per unit can be bought in any amount under a general license which means that a buyer need not be registered by any authorities polonium needs to be replaced in these devices nearly every year because of its short half life it is also highly radioactive and therefore has been mostly replaced by less dangerous beta particle sources tiny amounts of po are sometimes used in the laboratory and for teaching purposes typically of the order of kbq ci in the form of sealed sources with the polonium deposited on a substrate or in a resin or polymer matrix are often exempt from licensing by the nrc and similar authorities as they are not considered hazardous small amounts of po are manufactured for sale to the public in the united states as needle sources for laboratory experimentation and they are retailed by scientific supply companies the polonium is a layer of plating which in turn is plated with a material such as gold which allows the alpha radiation used in experiments such as cloud chambers to pass while preventing the polonium from being released and presenting a toxic hazard polonium spark plugs were marketed by firestone from to while the amount of radiation from the plugs was minuscule and not a threat to the consumer the benefits of such plugs quickly diminished after approximately a month because of polonium s short half life and because buildup on the conductors would block the radiation that improved engine performance the premise behind the polonium spark plug as well as alfred matthew hubbard s prototype radium plug that preceded it was that the radiation would improve ionization of the fuel in the cylinder and thus allow the motor to fire more quickly and efficiently biology and toxicity overview polonium can be hazardous and has no biological role by mass polonium is around times more toxic than hydrogen cyanide the ld for po is less than microgram for an average adult see below compared with about milligrams for hydrogen cyanide the main hazard is its intense radioactivity as an alpha emitter which makes it difficult to handle safely even in microgram amounts handling po is extremely dangerous requiring specialized equipment a negative pressure alpha glove box equipped with high performance filters adequate monitoring and strict handling procedures to avoid any contamination alpha particles emitted by polonium will damage organic tissue easily if polonium is ingested inhaled or absorbed although they do not penetrate the epidermis and hence are not hazardous as long as the alpha particles remain outside the body wearing chemically resistant and intact gloves is a mandatory precaution to avoid transcutaneous diffusion of polonium directly through the skin polonium delivered in concentrated nitric acid can easily diffuse through inadequate gloves e g latex gloves or the acid may damage the gloves polonium does not have toxic chemical properties it has been reported that some microbes can methylate polonium by the action of methylcobalamin this is similar to the way in which mercury selenium and tellurium are methylated in living things to create organometallic compounds studies investigating the metabolism of polonium in rats have shown that only to of polonium ingested is excreted as volatile polonium acute effects the median lethal dose ld for acute radiation exposure is about sv the committed effective dose equivalent po is sv bq if ingested and sv bq if inhaled a fatal sv dose can be caused by ingesting mbq ci about nanograms ng or inhaling mbq ci about ng one gram of po could thus in theory poison million people of whom million would die the actual toxicity of po is lower than these estimates because radiation exposure that is spread out over several weeks the biological half life of polonium in humans is to days is somewhat less damaging than an instantaneous dose it has been estimated that a median lethal dose of po is megabecquerels mci or micrograms g still an extremely small amount for comparison one grain of table salt is about mg g long term chronic effects in addition to the acute effects radiation exposure both internal and external carries a long term risk of death from cancer of per sv the general population is exposed to small amounts of polonium as a radon daughter in indoor air the isotopes po and po are thought to cause the majority of the estimated lung cancer deaths in the us every year that have been attributed to indoor radon tobacco smoking causes additional exposure to polonium regulatory exposure limits and handling the maximum allowable body burden for ingested po is only kbq nci which is equivalent to a particle massing only picograms the maximum permissible workplace concentration of airborne po is about bq m ci cm the target organs for polonium in humans are the spleen and liver as the spleen g and the liver to kg are much smaller than the rest of the body if the polonium is concentrated in these vital organs it is a greater threat to life than the dose which would be suffered on average by the whole body if it were spread evenly throughout the body in the same way as caesium or tritium as t o po is widely used in industry and readily available with little regulation or restriction in the us a tracking system run by the nuclear regulatory commission was implemented in to register purchases of more than curies gbq of polonium enough to make up lethal doses the iaea is said to be considering tighter regulations there is talk that it might tighten the polonium reporting requirement by a factor of to curies gbq as of this is still the only alpha emitting byproduct material available as a nrc exempt quantity which may be held without a radioactive material license polonium and its compounds must be handled in a glove box which is further enclosed in another box maintained at a slightly higher pressure than the glove box to prevent the radioactive materials from leaking out gloves made of natural rubber do not provide sufficient protection against the radiation from polonium surgical gloves are necessary neoprene gloves shield radiation from polonium better than natural rubber cases of poisoning despite the element s highly hazardous properties circumstances in which polonium poisoning can occur are rare its extreme scarcity in nature the short half lives of all its isotopes the specialised facilities and equipment needed to obtain any significant quantity and safety precautions against laboratory accidents all make harmful exposure events unlikely as such only a handful of cases of radiation poisoning specifically attributable to polonium exposure have been confirmed th century in response to concerns about the risks of occupational polonium exposure quantities of po were administered to five human volunteers at the university of rochester from to in order to study its biological behaviour these studies were funded by the manhattan project and the aec four men and a woman participated all suffering from terminal cancers and ranged in age from their early thirties to early forties all were chosen because experimenters wanted subjects who had not been exposed to polonium either through work or accident po was injected into four hospitalised patients and orally given to a fifth none of the administered doses all ranging from to ci kg approached fatal quantities the first documented death directly resulting from polonium poisoning occurred in the soviet union on july an unidentified year old man presented for medical treatment on june with severe vomiting and fever the previous day he had been working for five hours in an area in which unknown to him a capsule containing po had depressurised and begun to disperse in aerosol form over this period his total intake of airborne po was estimated at gbq almost times the estimated ld by inhalation of mbq despite treatment his condition continued to worsen and he died days after the exposure event it has also been suggested that ir ne joliot curie s death from leukaemia was owed to the radiation effects of polonium she was accidentally exposed in when a sealed capsule of the element exploded on her laboratory bench as well several deaths in israel during have been alleged to have resulted from po exposure a leak was discovered at a weizmann institute laboratory in traces of po were found on the hands of professor dror sadeh a physicist who researched radioactive materials medical tests indicated no harm but the tests did not include bone marrow sadeh one of his students and two colleagues died from various cancers over the subsequent few years the issue was investigated secretly but there was never any formal admission of a connection between the leak and the deaths st century the cause of the death of alexander litvinenko a former russian fsb agent who had defected to the united kingdom in was identified to be poisoning with a lethal dose of po it was subsequently determined that the po had probably been deliberately administered to him by two russian ex security agents andrey lugovoy and dmitry kovtun as such litvinenko s death was the first and to date only confirmed instance in which polonium s extreme toxicity has been used with malicious intent in an allegation surfaced that the death of palestinian leader yasser arafat who died on november of uncertain causes also resulted from deliberate polonium poisoning and in july abnormally high concentrations of po were detected in arafat s clothes and personal belongings by the institut de radiophysique in lausanne switzerland however the institut s spokesman stressed that despite these tests arafat s medical reports were not consistent with po poisoning and science journalist deborah blum suggested that tobacco smoke might rather have been responsible as both arafat and many of his colleagues were heavy smokers subsequent tests by both french and russian teams determined that the elevated po levels were not the result of deliberate poisoning and did not cause arafat s death treatment it has been suggested that chelation agents such as british anti lewisite dimercaprol can be used to decontaminate humans in one experiment rats were given a fatal dose of mbq kg ng kg of po all untreated rats were dead after days but of the rats treated with the chelation agent hoetttc remained alive for months detection in biological specimens polonium may be quantified in biological specimens by alpha particle spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation the baseline urinary excretion of polonium in healthy persons due to routine exposure to environmental sources is normally in a range of mbq day levels in excess of mbq day are suggestive of excessive exposure to the radionuclide occurrence in humans and the biosphere polonium is widespread in the biosphere including in human tissues because of its position in the uranium decay chain natural uranium in the earth s crust decays through a series of solid radioactive intermediates including radium to the radioactive noble gas radon some of which during its day half life diffuses into the atmosphere there it decays through several more steps to polonium much of which during its day half life is washed back down to the earth s surface thus entering the biosphere before finally decaying to stable lead as early as the s french biologist antoine lacassagne using polonium provided by his colleague marie curie showed that the element has a specific pattern of uptake in rabbit tissues with high concentrations particularly in liver kidney and testes more recent evidence suggests that this behavior results from polonium substituting for its congener sulfur also in group of the periodic table in sulfur containing amino acids or related molecules and that similar patterns of distribution occur in human tissues polonium is indeed an element naturally present in all humans contributing appreciably to natural background dose with wide geographical and cultural variations and particularly high levels in arctic residents for example tobacco polonium in tobacco contributes to many of the cases of lung cancer worldwide most of this polonium is derived from lead deposited on tobacco leaves from the atmosphere the lead is a product of radon gas much of which appears to originate from the decay of radium from fertilizers applied to the tobacco soils the presence of polonium in tobacco smoke has been known since the early s some of the world s biggest tobacco firms researched ways to remove the substance to no avail over a year period the results were never published food polonium is found in the food chain especially in seafood ,84
Astatine,At,astatine is a chemical element with the symbol at and atomic number it is the rarest naturally occurring element in the earth s crust occurring only as the decay product of various heavier elements all of astatine s isotopes are short lived the most stable is astatine with a half life of hours a sample of the pure element has never been assembled because any macroscopic specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity the bulk properties of astatine are not known with certainty many of them have been estimated from the element s position on the periodic table as a heavier analog of iodine and a member of the halogens the group of elements including fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine however astatine also falls roughly along the dividing line between metals and nonmetals and some metallic behavior has also been observed and predicted for it astatine is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a semiconductor or possibly a metal chemically several anionic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine but it also sometimes displays metallic characteristics and shows some similarities to silver the first synthesis of the element was in by dale r corson kenneth ross mackenzie and emilio g segr at the university of california berkeley who named it from the ancient greek astatos unstable four isotopes of astatine were subsequently found to be naturally occurring although much less than one gram is present at any given time in the earth s crust neither the most stable isotope astatine nor the medically useful astatine occur naturally they can only be produced synthetically usually by bombarding bismuth with alpha particles characteristics astatine is an extremely radioactive element all its isotopes have half lives of hours or less decaying into other astatine isotopes bismuth polonium or radon most of its isotopes are very unstable with half lives of one second or less of the first elements in the periodic table only francium is less stable and all the astatine isotopes more stable than francium are in any case synthetic and do not occur in nature the bulk properties of astatine are not known with any certainty research is limited by its short half life which prevents the creation of weighable quantities a visible piece of astatine would immediately vaporize itself because of the heat generated by its intense radioactivity it remains to be seen if with sufficient cooling a macroscopic quantity of astatine could be deposited as a thin film astatine is usually classified as either a nonmetal or a metalloid metal formation has also been predicted physical most of the physical properties of astatine have been estimated by interpolation or extrapolation using theoretically or empirically derived methods for example halogens get darker with increasing atomic weight fluorine is nearly colorless chlorine is yellow green bromine is red brown and iodine is dark gray violet astatine is sometimes described as probably being a black solid assuming it follows this trend or as having a metallic appearance if it is a metalloid or a metal astatine sublimes less readily than does iodine having a lower vapor pressure even so half of a given quantity of astatine will vaporize in approximately an hour if put on a clean glass surface at room temperature the absorption spectrum of astatine in the middle ultraviolet region has lines at and nm suggestive of p to s transitions the structure of solid astatine is unknown as an analogue of iodine it may have an orthorhombic crystalline structure composed of diatomic astatine molecules and be a semiconductor with a band gap of ev alternatively if condensed astatine forms a metallic phase as has been predicted it may have a monatomic face centered cubic structure in this structure it may well be a superconductor like the similar high pressure phase of iodine metallic astatine is expected to have a density of g cm evidence for or against the existence of diatomic astatine at is sparse and inconclusive some sources state that it does not exist or at least has never been observed while other sources assert or imply its existence despite this controversy many properties of diatomic astatine have been predicted for example its bond length would be pm dissociation energy kj mol and heat of vaporization hvap kj mol many values have been predicted for the melting and boiling points of astatine but only for at chemical the chemistry of astatine is clouded by the extremely low concentrations at which astatine experiments have been conducted and the possibility of reactions with impurities walls and filters or radioactivity by products and other unwanted nano scale interactions many of its apparent chemical properties have been observed using tracer studies on extremely dilute astatine solutions typically less than mol l some properties such as anion formation align with other halogens astatine has some metallic characteristics as well such as plating onto a cathode and coprecipitating with metal sulfides in hydrochloric acid it forms complexes with edta a metal chelating agent and is capable of acting as a metal in antibody radiolabeling in some respects astatine in the state is akin to silver in the same state most of the organic chemistry of astatine is however analogous to that of iodine it has been suggested that astatine can form a stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution but electromigration evidence suggests that the cationic at i species is protonated hypoastatous acid h oat showing analogy to iodine astatine has an electronegativity of on the revised pauling scale lower than that of iodine and the same as hydrogen in hydrogen astatide hat the negative charge is predicted to be on the hydrogen atom implying that this compound could be referred to as astatine hydride according to certain nomenclatures that would be consistent with the electronegativity of astatine on the allred rochow scale being less than that of hydrogen however official iupac stoichiometric nomenclature is based on an idealized convention of determining the relative electronegativities of the elements by the mere virtue of their position within the periodic table according to this convention astatine is handled as though it is more electronegative than hydrogen irrespective of its true electronegativity the electron affinity of astatine at kj mol is less than that of iodine in comparison the value of cl is higher than f br is less than cl and i is less than br the marked reduction for at was predicted as being due to spin orbit interactions the first ionisation energy of astatine is about kj mol which continues the trend of decreasing first ionisation energies down the halogen group fluorine chlorine bromine iodine compounds less reactive than iodine astatine is the least reactive of the halogens its compounds have been synthesized in nano scale amounts and studied as intensively as possible before their radioactive disintegration the reactions involved have been typically tested with dilute solutions of astatine mixed with larger amounts of iodine acting as a carrier the iodine ensures there is sufficient material for laboratory techniques such as filtration and precipitation to work like iodine astatine has been shown to adopt odd numbered oxidation states ranging from to only a few compounds with metals have been reported in the form of astatides of sodium palladium silver thallium and lead some characteristic properties of silver and sodium astatide and the other hypothetical alkali and alkaline earth astatides have been estimated by extrapolation from other metal halides the formation of an astatine compound with hydrogen usually referred to as hydrogen astatide was noted by the pioneers of astatine chemistry as mentioned there are grounds for instead referring to this compound as astatine hydride it is easily oxidized acidification by dilute nitric acid gives the at or at forms and the subsequent addition of silver i may only partially at best precipitate astatine as silver i astatide agat iodine in contrast is not oxidized and precipitates readily as silver i iodide astatine is known to bind to boron carbon and nitrogen various boron cage compounds have been prepared with at b bonds these being more stable than at c bonds astatine can replace a hydrogen atom in benzene to form astatobenzene c h at this may be oxidized to c h atcl by chlorine by treating this compound with an alkaline solution of hypochlorite c h ato can be produced the dipyridine astatine i cation at c h n forms ionic compounds with perchlorate a non coordinating anion and with nitrate at c h n no this cation exists as a coordination complex in which two dative covalent bonds separately link the astatine i centre with each of the pyridine rings via their nitrogen atoms with oxygen there is evidence of the species ato and ato in aqueous solution formed by the reaction of astatine with an oxidant such as elemental bromine or in the last case by sodium persulfate in a solution of perchloric acid the latter species might also be protonated astatous acid h ato the species previously thought to be ato has since been determined to be ato oh a hydrolysis product of ato another such hydrolysis product being atooh the well characterized ato anion can be obtained by for example the oxidation of astatine with potassium hypochlorite in a solution of potassium hydroxide preparation of lanthanum triastatate la ato following the oxidation of astatine by a hot na s o solution has been reported further oxidation of ato such as by xenon difluoride in a hot alkaline solution or periodate in a neutral or alkaline solution yields the perastatate ion ato this is only stable in neutral or alkaline solutions astatine is also thought to be capable of forming cations in salts with oxyanions such as iodate or dichromate this is based on the observation that in acidic solutions monovalent or intermediate positive states of astatine coprecipitate with the insoluble salts of metal cations such as silver i iodate or thallium i dichromate astatine may form bonds to the other chalcogens these include s at and at csn with sulfur a coordination selenourea compound with selenium and an astatine tellurium colloid with tellurium astatine is known to react with its lighter homologs iodine bromine and chlorine in the vapor state these reactions produce diatomic interhalogen compounds with formulas ati atbr and atcl the first two compounds may also be produced in water astatine reacts with iodine iodide solution to form ati whereas atbr requires aside from astatine an iodine iodine monobromide bromide solution the excess of iodides or bromides may lead to atbr and ati ions or in a chloride solution they may produce species like atcl or atbrcl via equilibrium reactions with the chlorides oxidation of the element with dichromate in nitric acid solution showed that adding chloride turned the astatine into a molecule likely to be either atcl or atocl similarly atocl or atcl may be produced the polyhalides pdati csati tlati and pbati are known or presumed to have been precipitated in a plasma ion source mass spectrometer the ions ati atbr and atcl have been formed by introducing lighter halogen vapors into a helium filled cell containing astatine supporting the existence of stable neutral molecules in the plasma ion state no astatine fluorides have been discovered yet their absence has been speculatively attributed to the extreme reactivity of such compounds including the reaction of an initially formed fluoride with the walls of the glass container to form a non volatile product thus although the synthesis of an astatine fluoride is thought to be possible it may require a liquid halogen fluoride solvent as has already been used for the characterization of radon fluoride history in when dmitri mendeleev published his periodic table the space under iodine was empty after niels bohr established the physical basis of the classification of chemical elements it was suggested that the fifth halogen belonged there before its officially recognized discovery it was called eka iodine from sanskrit eka one to imply it was one space under iodine in the same manner as eka silicon eka boron and others scientists tried to find it in nature given its extreme rarity these attempts resulted in several false discoveries the first claimed discovery of eka iodine was made by fred allison and his associates at the alabama polytechnic institute now auburn university in the discoverers named element alabamine and assigned it the symbol ab designations that were used for a few years in h g macpherson of university of california berkeley disproved allison s method and the validity of his discovery there was another claim in by the chemist rajendralal de working in dacca in british india now dhaka in bangladesh he chose the name dakin for element which he claimed to have isolated as the thorium series equivalent of radium f polonium in the radium series the properties he reported for dakin do not correspond to those of astatine and astatine s radioactivity would have prevented him from handling it in the quantities he claimed moreover astatine is not found in the thorium series and the true identity of dakin is not known in the team of romanian physicist horia hulubei and french physicist yvette cauchois claimed to have discovered element by observing its x ray emission lines in they published another paper which supported and extended previous data in hulubei published a summary of data he had obtained up to that time claiming it was supported by the work of other researchers he chose the name dor presumably from the romanian for longing for peace as world war ii had started five years earlier as hulubei was writing in french a language which does not accommodate the ine suffix dor would likely have been rendered in english as dorine had it been adopted in hulubei s claim was effectively rejected by the austrian chemist friedrich paneth who would later chair the iupac committee responsible for recognition of new elements even though hulubei s samples did contain astatine his means to detect it were too weak by current standards to enable correct identification moreover he could not perform chemical tests on the element he had also been involved in an earlier false claim as to the discovery of element francium and this is thought to have caused other researchers to downplay his work in the swiss chemist walter minder announced the discovery of element as the beta decay product of radium a polonium choosing the name helvetium from helvetia the latin name of switzerland berta karlik and traude bernert were unsuccessful in reproducing his experiments and subsequently attributed minder s results to contamination of his radon stream radon is the parent isotope of polonium in minder in collaboration with the english scientist alice leigh smith announced the discovery of another isotope of element presumed to be the product of thorium a polonium beta decay they named this substance anglo helvetium but karlik and bernert were again unable to reproduce these results later in dale r corson kenneth ross mackenzie and emilio segr isolated the element at the university of california berkeley instead of searching for the element in nature the scientists created it by bombarding bismuth with alpha particles in a cyclotron particle accelerator to produce after emission of two neutrons astatine the discoverers however did not immediately suggest a name for the element the reason for this was that at the time an element created synthetically in invisible quantities that had not yet been discovered in nature was not seen as a completely valid one in addition chemists were reluctant to recognize radioactive isotopes as legitimately as stable ones in astatine was found as a product of two naturally occurring decay chains by berta karlik and traude bernert first in the so called uranium series and then in the actinium series since then astatine was also found in a third decay chain the neptunium series friedrich paneth in called to finally recognize synthetic elements quoting among other reasons recent confirmation of their natural occurrence and proposed that the discoverers of the newly discovered unnamed elements name these elements in early nature published the discoverers suggestions a letter from corson mackenzie and segr suggested the name astatine coming from the greek astatos meaning unstable because of its propensity for radioactive decay with the ending ine found in the names of the four previously discovered halogens the name was also chosen to continue the tradition of the four stable halogens where the name referred to a property of the element corson and his colleagues classified astatine as a metal on the basis of its analytical chemistry subsequent investigators reported iodine like cationic or amphoteric behavior in a retrospective corson wrote that some of the properties of astatine are similar to iodine it also exhibits metallic properties more like its metallic neighbors po and bi isotopes there are known isotopes of astatine with atomic masses mass numbers of theoretical modeling suggests that more isotopes could exist no stable or long lived astatine isotope has been observed nor is one expected to exist astatine s alpha decay energies follow the same trend as for other heavy elements lighter astatine isotopes have quite high energies of alpha decay which become lower as the nuclei become heavier astatine has a significantly higher energy than the previous isotope because it has a nucleus with neutrons and is a magic number corresponding to a filled neutron shell despite having a similar half life to the previous isotope hours for astatine and hours for astatine the alpha decay probability is much higher for the latter against only the two following isotopes release even more energy with astatine releasing the most energy for this reason it is the shortest lived astatine isotope even though heavier astatine isotopes release less energy no long lived astatine isotope exists because of the increasing role of beta decay electron emission this decay mode is especially important for astatine as early as it was postulated that all isotopes of the element undergo beta decay though nuclear mass measurements indicate that at is in fact beta stable as it has the lowest mass of all isobars with a a beta decay mode has been found for all other astatine isotopes except for astatine astatine and astatine m astatine and lighter isotopes exhibit beta plus decay positron emission astatine and heavier isotopes exhibit beta minus decay and astatine decays via both modes while astatine undergoes electron capture the most stable isotope is astatine which has a half life of hours the primary decay mode is beta plus to the relatively long lived in comparison to astatine isotopes alpha emitter polonium in total only five isotopes have half lives exceeding one hour astatine to the least stable ground state isotope is astatine with a half life of nanoseconds it undergoes alpha decay to the extremely long lived bismuth astatine has known nuclear isomers which are nuclei with one or more nucleons protons or neutrons in an excited state a nuclear isomer may also be called a meta state meaning the system has more internal energy than the ground state the state with the lowest possible internal energy making the former likely to decay into the latter there may be more than one isomer for each isotope the most stable of these nuclear isomers is astatine m which has a half life of about minutes longer than those of all the ground states bar those of isotopes and the least stable is astatine m its half life of nanoseconds is shorter than those of all ground states except that of astatine natural occurrence astatine is the rarest naturally occurring element the total amount of astatine in the earth s crust quoted mass grams is estimated by some to be less than one gram at any given time other sources estimate the amount of ephemeral astatine present on earth at any given moment to be up to one ounce about grams any astatine present at the formation of the earth has long since disappeared the four naturally occurring isotopes astatine and are instead continuously produced as a result of the decay of radioactive thorium and uranium ores and trace quantities of neptunium the landmass of north and south america combined to a depth of kilometers miles contains only about one trillion astatine atoms at any given time around grams astatine is produced via the radioactive decay of neptunium primordial remnants of the latter isotope due to its relatively short half life of million years are no longer present on earth however trace amounts occur naturally as a product of transmutation reactions in uranium ores astatine was the first astatine isotope discovered in nature astatine with a half life of seconds is the longest lived of the naturally occurring isotopes isotopes of astatine are sometimes not listed as naturally occurring because of misconceptions that there are no such isotopes or discrepancies in the literature astatine has been counted as a naturally occurring isotope but reports of its observation which were described as doubtful have not been confirmed synthesis formation astatine was first produced by bombarding bismuth with energetic alpha particles and this is still the major route used to create the relatively long lived isotopes astatine through astatine astatine is only produced in minuscule quantities with modern techniques allowing production runs of up to giga becquerels about nanograms or atoms synthesis of greater quantities of astatine using this method is constrained by the limited availability of suitable cyclotrons and the prospect of melting the target solvent radiolysis due to the cumulative effect of astatine decay is a related problem with cryogenic technology microgram quantities of astatine might be able to be generated via proton irradiation of thorium or uranium to yield radon in turn decaying to astatine contamination with astatine is expected to be a drawback of this method the most important isotope is astatine the only one in commercial use to produce the bismuth target the metal is sputtered onto a gold copper or aluminium surface at to milligrams per square centimeter bismuth oxide can be used instead this is forcibly fused with a copper plate the target is kept under a chemically neutral nitrogen atmosphere and is cooled with water to prevent premature astatine vaporization in a particle accelerator such as a cyclotron alpha particles are collided with the bismuth even though only one bismuth isotope is used bismuth the reaction may occur in three possible ways producing astatine astatine or astatine in order to eliminate undesired nuclides the maximum energy of the particle accelerator is set to a value optimally mev above that for the reaction producing astatine to produce the desired isotope and below the one producing astatine to avoid producing other astatine isotopes separation methods since astatine is the main product of the synthesis after its formation it must only be separated from the target and any significant contaminants several methods are available but they generally follow one of two approaches dry distillation or wet acid treatment of the target followed by solvent extraction the methods summarized below are modern adaptations of older procedures as reviewed by kugler and keller pre techniques more often addressed the elimination of co produced toxic polonium this requirement is now mitigated by capping the energy of the cyclotron irradiation beam dry the astatine containing cyclotron target is heated to a temperature of around c the astatine volatilizes and is condensed in typically a cold trap higher temperatures of up to around c may increase the yield at the risk of bismuth contamination from concurrent volatilization redistilling the condensate may be required to minimize the presence of bismuth as bismuth can interfere with astatine labeling reactions the astatine is recovered from the trap using one or more low concentration solvents such as sodium hydroxide methanol or chloroform astatine yields of up to around may be achieved dry separation is the method most commonly used to produce a chemically useful form of astatine wet the irradiated bismuth or sometimes bismuth trioxide target is first dissolved in for example concentrated nitric or perchloric acid following this first step the acid can be distilled away to leave behind a white residue that contains both bismuth and the desired astatine product this residue is then dissolved in a concentrated acid such as hydrochloric acid astatine is extracted from this acid using an organic solvent such as butyl or isopropyl ether diisopropylether dipe or thiosemicarbazide using liquid liquid extraction the astatine product can be repeatedly washed with an acid such as hcl and extracted into the organic solvent layer a separation yield of using nitric acid has been reported falling to by the time purification procedures were completed distillation of nitric acid purging residual nitrogen oxides and redissolving bismuth nitrate to enable liquid liquid extraction wet methods involve multiple radioactivity handling steps and have not been considered well suited for isolating larger quantities of astatine however wet extraction methods are being examined for use in production of larger quantities of astatine as it is thought that wet extraction methods can provide more consistency they can enable the production of astatine in a specific oxidation state and may have greater applicability in experimental radiochemistry uses and precautions newly formed astatine is the subject of ongoing research in nuclear medicine it must be used quickly as it decays with a half life of hours this is long enough to permit multistep labeling strategies astatine has potential for targeted alpha particle therapy since it decays either via emission of an alpha particle to bismuth or via electron capture to an extremely short lived nuclide polonium which undergoes further alpha decay very quickly reaching its stable granddaughter lead polonium x rays emitted as a result of the electron capture branch in the range of kev enable the tracking of astatine in animals and patients although astatine has a slightly longer half life it is wholly unsuitable because it usually undergoes beta plus decay to the extremely toxic polonium the principal medicinal difference between astatine and iodine a radioactive iodine isotope also used in medicine is that iodine emits high energy beta particles and astatine does not beta particles have much greater penetrating power through tissues than do the much heavier alpha particles an average alpha particle released by astatine can travel up to m through surrounding tissues an average energy beta particle emitted by iodine can travel nearly times as far to about mm the short half life and limited penetrating power of alpha radiation through tissues offers advantages in situations where the tumor burden is low and or malignant cell populations are located in close proximity to essential normal tissues significant morbidity in cell culture models of human cancers has been achieved with from one to ten astatine atoms bound per cell several obstacles have been encountered in the development of astatine based radiopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment world war ii delayed research for close to a decade results of early experiments indicated that a cancer selective carrier would need to be developed and it was not until the s that monoclonal antibodies became available for this purpose unlike iodine astatine shows a tendency to dehalogenate from molecular carriers such as these particularly at sp carbon sites less so from sp sites given the toxicity of astatine accumulated and retained in the body this emphasized the need to ensure it remained attached to its host molecule while astatine carriers that are slowly metabolized can be assessed for their efficacy more rapidly metabolized carriers remain a significant obstacle to the evaluation of astatine in nuclear medicine mitigating the effects of astatine induced radiolysis of labeling chemistry and carrier molecules is another area requiring further development a practical application for astatine as a cancer treatment would potentially be suitable for a staggering number of patients production of astatine in the quantities that would be required remains an issue animal studies show that astatine similarly to iodine although to a lesser extent perhaps because of its slightly more metallic nature is preferentially and dangerously concentrated in the thyroid gland unlike iodine astatine also shows a tendency to be taken up by the lungs and spleen possibly because of in body oxidation of at to at if administered in the form of a radiocolloid it tends to concentrate in the liver experiments in rats and monkeys suggest that astatine causes much greater damage to the thyroid gland than does iodine with repetitive injection of the nuclide resulting in necrosis and cell dysplasia within the gland early research suggested that injection of astatine into female rodents caused morphological changes in breast tissue this conclusion remained controversial for many years general agreement was later reached that this was likely caused by the effect of breast tissue irradiation combined with hormonal changes due to irradiation of the ovaries trace amounts of astatine can be handled safely in fume hoods if they are well aerated biological uptake of the element must be avoided ,85
Radon,Rn,radon is a chemical element with the symbol rn and atomic number it is a radioactive colourless odourless tasteless noble gas it occurs naturally in minute quantities as an intermediate step in the normal radioactive decay chains through which thorium and uranium slowly decay into various short lived radioactive elements and lead radon itself is the immediate decay product of radium its most stable isotope rn has a half life of only days making it one of the rarest elements since thorium and uranium are two of the most common radioactive elements on earth while also having three isotopes with half lives on the order of several billion years radon will be present on earth long into the future despite its short half life the decay of radon produces many other short lived nuclides known as radon daughters ending at stable isotopes of lead unlike all other intermediate elements in the aforementioned decay chains radon is under standard conditions gaseous and easily inhaled and therefore a health hazard it is often the single largest contributor to an individual s background radiation dose but due to local differences in geology the level of exposure to radon gas differs from place to place a common source is uranium containing minerals in the ground and therefore it accumulates in subterranean areas such as basements radon can also occur in some ground water like spring waters and hot springs climate change may cause radon previously trapped underground to be released as permafrost thaws particularly in areas like the arctic alaska canada greenland and russia it is possible to test for radon and use techniques such as sub slab depressurization for mitigation epidemiological studies have shown a clear link between breathing high concentrations of radon and incidence of lung cancer radon is a contaminant that affects indoor air quality worldwide according to the united states environmental protection agency epa radon is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer after cigarette smoking causing lung cancer deaths per year in the united states about of these deaths occur among people who have never smoked while radon is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer it is the number one cause among non smokers according to epa policy oriented estimates significant uncertainties exist for the health effects of low dose exposures unlike the gaseous radon itself radon daughters are solids and stick to surfaces such as airborne dust particles which can cause lung cancer if inhaled characteristics physical properties radon is a colorless odorless and tasteless gas and therefore is not detectable by human senses alone at standard temperature and pressure it forms a monatomic gas with a density of kg m about times the density of the earth s atmosphere at sea level kg m it is one of the densest gases at room temperature and is the densest of the noble gases although colorless at standard temperature and pressure when cooled below its freezing point of k c f it emits a brilliant radioluminescence that turns from yellow to orange red as the temperature lowers upon condensation it glows because of the intense radiation it produces it is sparingly soluble in water but more soluble than lighter noble gases it is appreciably more soluble in organic liquids than in water its solubility equation is as follows exp b t a displaystyle chi exp b t a where displaystyle chi is the molar fraction of radon t displaystyle t is the absolute temperature and a displaystyle a and b displaystyle b are solvent constants chemical properties radon is a member of the zero valence elements that are called noble gases and is chemically not very reactive the day half life of radon makes it useful in physical sciences as a natural tracer because radon is a gas at standard conditions unlike its decay chain parents it can readily be extracted from them for research it is inert to most common chemical reactions such as combustion because the outer valence shell contains eight electrons this produces a stable minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound its first ionization energy the minimum energy required to extract one electron from it is kj mol in accordance with periodic trends radon has a lower electronegativity than the element one period before it xenon and is therefore more reactive early studies concluded that the stability of radon hydrate should be of the same order as that of the hydrates of chlorine cl or sulfur dioxide so and significantly higher than the stability of the hydrate of hydrogen sulfide h s because of its cost and radioactivity experimental chemical research is seldom performed with radon and as a result there are very few reported compounds of radon all either fluorides or oxides radon can be oxidized by powerful oxidizing agents such as fluorine thus forming radon difluoride rnf it decomposes back to its elements at a temperature of above k c f and is reduced by water to radon gas and hydrogen fluoride it may also be reduced back to its elements by hydrogen gas it has a low volatility and was thought to be rnf because of the short half life of radon and the radioactivity of its compounds it has not been possible to study the compound in any detail theoretical studies on this molecule predict that it should have a rn f bond distance of ngstr m and that the compound is thermodynamically more stable and less volatile than its lighter counterpart xenon difluoride xef the octahedral molecule rnf was predicted to have an even lower enthalpy of formation than the difluoride the rnf ion is believed to form by the following reaction rn g o sbf s rnf sb f s o g for this reason antimony pentafluoride together with chlorine trifluoride and n f sb f have been considered for radon gas removal in uranium mines due to the formation of radon fluorine compounds radon compounds can be formed by the decay of radium in radium halides a reaction that has been used to reduce the amount of radon that escapes from targets during irradiation additionally salts of the rnf cation with the anions sbf taf and bif are known radon is also oxidised by dioxygen difluoride to rnf at k c f radon oxides are among the few other reported compounds of radon only the trioxide rno has been confirmed the higher fluorides rnf and rnf have been claimed and are calculated to be stable but their identification is unclear they may have been observed in experiments where unknown radon containing products distilled together with xenon hexafluoride these may have been rnf rnf or both trace scale heating of radon with xenon fluorine bromine pentafluoride and either sodium fluoride or nickel fluoride was claimed to produce a higher fluoride as well which hydrolysed to form rno while it has been suggested that these claims were really due to radon precipitating out as the solid complex rnf nif the fact that radon coprecipitates from aqueous solution with csxeo f has been taken as confirmation that rno was formed which has been supported by further studies of the hydrolysed solution that rno f did not form in other experiments may have been due to the high concentration of fluoride used electromigration studies also suggest the presence of cationic hrno and anionic hrno forms of radon in weakly acidic aqueous solution ph the procedure having previously been validated by examination of the homologous xenon trioxide the decay technique has also been used avrorin et al reported in that fr compounds cocrystallised with their caesium analogues appeared to retain chemically bound radon after electron capture analogies with xenon suggested the formation of rno but this could not be confirmed it is likely that the difficulty in identifying higher fluorides of radon stems from radon being kinetically hindered from being oxidised beyond the divalent state because of the strong ionicity of radon difluoride rnf and the high positive charge on radon in rnf spatial separation of rnf molecules may be necessary to clearly identify higher fluorides of radon of which rnf is expected to be more stable than rnf due to spin orbit splitting of the p shell of radon rniv would have a closed shell s p configuration therefore while rnf should have a similar stability to xenon tetrafluoride xef rnf would likely be much less stable than xenon hexafluoride xef radon hexafluoride would also probably be a regular octahedral molecule unlike the distorted octahedral structure of xef because of the inert pair effect because radon is quite electropositive for a noble gas it is possible that radon fluorides actually take on highly fluorine bridged structures and are not volatile extrapolation down the noble gas group would suggest also the possible existence of rno rno and rnof as well as the first chemically stable noble gas chlorides rncl and rncl but none of these have yet been found radon carbonyl rnco has been predicted to be stable and to have a linear molecular geometry the molecules rn and rnxe were found to be significantly stabilized by spin orbit coupling radon caged inside a fullerene has been proposed as a drug for tumors despite the existence of xe viii no rn viii compounds have been claimed to exist rnf should be highly unstable chemically xef is thermodynamically unstable it is predicted that the most stable rn viii compound would be barium perradonate ba rno analogous to barium perxenate the instability of rn viii is due to the relativistic stabilization of the s shell also known as the inert pair effect radon reacts with the liquid halogen fluorides clf clf clf brf brf and if to form rnf in halogen fluoride solution radon is nonvolatile and exists as the rnf and rn cations addition of fluoride anions results in the formation of the complexes rnf and rnf paralleling the chemistry of beryllium ii and aluminium iii the standard electrode potential of the rn rn couple has been estimated as v although there is no evidence for the formation of stable radon ions or compounds in aqueous solution isotopes radon has no stable isotopes thirty nine radioactive isotopes have been characterized with atomic masses ranging from to the most stable isotope is rn which is a decay product of ra a decay product of u a trace amount of the highly unstable isotope rn is also among the daughters of rn three other radon isotopes have a half life of over an hour rn rn and rn the rn isotope is a natural decay product of the most stable thorium isotope th and is commonly referred to as thoron it has a half life of seconds and also emits alpha radiation similarly rn is derived from the most stable isotope of actinium ac named actinon and is an alpha emitter with a half life of seconds no radon isotopes occur significantly in the neptunium np decay series though a trace amount of the extremely unstable isotope rn is produced daughters rn belongs to the radium and uranium decay chain and has a half life of days its first four products excluding marginal decay schemes are very short lived meaning that the corresponding disintegrations are indicative of the initial radon distribution its decay goes through the following sequence rn days alpha decaying to po minutes alpha decaying to pb minutes beta decaying to bi minutes beta decaying to po ms alpha decaying to pb which has a much longer half life of years beta decaying to bi days beta decaying to po days alpha decaying to pb stable the radon equilibrium factor is the ratio between the activity of all short period radon progenies which are responsible for most of radon s biological effects and the activity that would be at equilibrium with the radon parent if a closed volume is constantly supplied with radon the concentration of short lived isotopes will increase until an equilibrium is reached where the rate of decay of each decay product will equal that of the radon itself the equilibrium factor is when both activities are equal meaning that the decay products have stayed close to the radon parent long enough for the equilibrium to be reached within a couple of hours under these conditions each additional pci l of radon will increase exposure by working level wl a measure of radioactivity commonly used in mining these conditions are not always met in many homes the equilibrium factor is typically that is there will be wl of daughters for each pci l of radon in the air pb takes much longer decades to come in equilibrium with radon but if the environment permits accumulation of dust over extended periods of time pb and its decay products may contribute to overall radiation levels as well because of their electrostatic charge radon progenies adhere to surfaces or dust particles whereas gaseous radon does not attachment removes them from the air usually causing the equilibrium factor in the atmosphere to be less than the equilibrium factor is also lowered by air circulation or air filtration devices and is increased by airborne dust particles including cigarette smoke the equilibrium factor found in epidemiological studies is history and etymology radon was the fifth radioactive element to be discovered in by ernest rutherford and robert b owens at mcgill university in montreal after uranium thorium radium and polonium in pierre and marie curie observed that the gas emitted by radium remained radioactive for a month later that year rutherford and owens noticed variations when trying to measure radiation from thorium oxide rutherford noticed that the compounds of thorium continuously emit a radioactive gas that remains radioactive for several minutes and called this gas emanation from latin emanare to flow out and emanatio expiration and later thorium emanation th em in friedrich ernst dorn reported some experiments in which he noticed that radium compounds emanate a radioactive gas he named radium emanation ra em in rutherford and harriet brooks demonstrated that the emanations are radioactive but credited the curies for the discovery of the element in similar emanations were observed from actinium by andr louis debierne and were called actinium emanation ac em several shortened names were soon suggested for the three emanations exradio exthorio and exactinio in radon ro thoron to and akton or acton ao in radeon thoreon and actineon in and eventually radon thoron and actinon in the name radon is not related to that of the austrian mathematician johann radon the likeness of the spectra of these three gases with those of argon krypton and xenon and their observed chemical inertia led sir william ramsay to suggest in that the emanations might contain a new element of the noble gas family in the early th century in the us gold contaminated with the radon daughter pb entered the jewelry industry this was from gold seeds that had held rn that had been melted down after the radon had decayed in ramsay and robert whytlaw gray isolated radon and determined its melting temperature and approximate density in they determined that it was the heaviest known gas they wrote that l expression l manation du radium est fort incommode the expression radium emanation is very awkward and suggested the new name niton nt from latin nitens shining to emphasize the radioluminescence property and in it was accepted by the international commission for atomic weights in the international committee for chemical elements and international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac chose among the names radon rn thoron tn and actinon an later when isotopes were numbered instead of named the element took the name of the most stable isotope radon while tn was renamed rn and an was renamed rn this has caused some confusion in the literature regarding the element s discovery as while dorn had discovered radon the isotope he had not been the first to discover radon the element as late as the s the element was also referred to simply as emanation the first synthesized compound of radon radon fluoride was obtained in even today the word radon may refer to either the element or its isotope rn with thoron remaining in use as a short name for rn to stem this ambiguity the name actinon for rn is rarely encountered today probably due to the short half life of that isotope the danger of high exposure to radon in mines where exposures can reach bq m has long been known in paracelsus described a wasting disease of miners the mala metallorum and georg agricola recommended ventilation in mines to avoid this mountain sickness bergsucht in this condition was identified as lung cancer by harting and hesse in their investigation of miners from schneeberg germany the first major studies with radon and health occurred in the context of uranium mining in the joachimsthal region of bohemia in the us studies and mitigation only followed decades of health effects on uranium miners of the southwestern us employed during the early cold war standards were not implemented until the presence of radon in indoor air was documented as early as beginning in the s research was initiated to address sources of indoor radon determinants of concentration health effects and mitigation approaches in the us the problem of indoor radon received widespread publicity and intensified investigation after a widely publicized incident in during routine monitoring at a pennsylvania nuclear power plant a worker was found to be contaminated with radioactivity a high concentration of radon in his home was subsequently identified as responsible occurrence concentration units all discussions of radon concentrations in the environment refer to rn while the average rate of production of rn from the thorium decay series is about the same as that of rn the amount of rn in the environment is much less than that of rn because of the short half life of rn seconds versus days respectively radon concentration in the atmosphere is usually measured in becquerel per cubic meter bq m the si derived unit another unit of measurement common in the us is picocuries per liter pci l pci l bq m typical domestic exposures average about bq m indoors though this varies widely and bq m outdoors in the mining industry the exposure is traditionally measured in working level wl and the cumulative exposure in working level month wlm wl equals any combination of short lived rn daughters po pb bi and po in liter of air that releases mev of potential alpha energy wl is equivalent to joules per cubic meter of air j m the si unit of cumulative exposure is expressed in joule hours per cubic meter j h m one wlm is equivalent to j h m an exposure to wl for working month hours equals wlm cumulative exposure a cumulative exposure of wlm is roughly equivalent to living one year in an atmosphere with a radon concentration of bq m rn decays to pb and other radioisotopes the levels of pb can be measured the rate of deposition of this radioisotope is weather dependent radon concentrations found in natural environments are much too low to be detected by chemical means a bq m relatively high concentration corresponds to picogram per cubic meter pg m the average concentration of radon in the atmosphere is about molar percent or about atoms in each milliliter of air the radon activity of the entire earth s atmosphere originates from only a few tens of grams of radon consistently replaced by decay of larger amounts of radium thorium and uranium natural radon is produced by the radioactive decay of radium which is found in uranium ores phosphate rock shales igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granite gneiss and schist and to a lesser degree in common rocks such as limestone every square mile of surface soil to a depth of inches km to a depth of cm contains approximately gram of radium which releases radon in small amounts to the atmosphere on a global scale it is estimated that billion curies ebq of radon are released from soil annually this is equivalent to some kilograms lb radon concentration can differ widely from place to place in the open air it ranges from to bq m even less bq m above the ocean in caves or ventilated mines or poorly ventilated houses its concentration climbs to bq m radon concentration can be much higher in mining contexts ventilation regulations instruct to maintain radon concentration in uranium mines under the working level with th percentile levels ranging up to nearly wl pci rn per liter of air kbq m measured from to the concentration in the air at the unventilated gastein healing gallery averages kbq m nci l with maximal value of kbq m nci l radon mostly appears with the decay chain of the radium and uranium series rn and marginally with the thorium series rn the element emanates naturally from the ground and some building materials all over the world wherever traces of uranium or thorium are found and particularly in regions with soils containing granite or shale which have a higher concentration of uranium not all granitic regions are prone to high emissions of radon being a rare gas it usually migrates freely through faults and fragmented soils and may accumulate in caves or water owing to its very short half life four days for rn radon concentration decreases very quickly when the distance from the production area increases radon concentration varies greatly with season and atmospheric conditions for instance it has been shown to accumulate in the air if there is a meteorological inversion and little wind high concentrations of radon can be found in some spring waters and hot springs the towns of boulder montana misasa bad kreuznach germany and the country of japan have radium rich springs that emit radon to be classified as a radon mineral water radon concentration must be above nci l kbq m the activity of radon mineral water reaches kbq m in merano and kbq m in lurisia italy natural radon concentrations in the earth s atmosphere are so low that radon rich water in contact with the atmosphere will continually lose radon by volatilization hence ground water has a higher concentration of rn than surface water because radon is continuously produced by radioactive decay of ra present in rocks likewise the saturated zone of a soil frequently has a higher radon content than the unsaturated zone because of diffusional losses to the atmosphere in apollo passed km mi above the aristarchus plateau on the moon and detected a significant rise in alpha particles thought to be caused by the decay of rn the presence of rn has been inferred later from data obtained from the lunar prospector alpha particle spectrometer radon is found in some petroleum because radon has a similar pressure and temperature curve to propane and oil refineries separate petrochemicals based on their boiling points the piping carrying freshly separated propane in oil refineries can become contaminated because of decaying radon and its products residues from the petroleum and natural gas industry often contain radium and its daughters the sulfate scale from an oil well can be radium rich while the water oil and gas from a well often contains radon radon decays to form solid radioisotopes that form coatings on the inside of pipework accumulation in buildings high concentrations of radon in homes were discovered by chance in after the stringent radiation testing conducted at the new limerick generating station nuclear power plant revealed that stanley watras a construction engineer at the plant was contaminated by radioactive substances even though the reactor had never been fueled typical domestic exposures are of approximately bq m pci l indoors some level of radon will be found in all buildings radon mostly enters a building directly from the soil through the lowest level in the building that is in contact with the ground high levels of radon in the water supply can also increase indoor radon air levels typical entry points of radon into buildings are cracks in solid foundations and walls construction joints gaps in suspended floors and around service pipes cavities inside walls and the water supply radon concentrations in the same place may differ by double half over one hour also the concentration in one room of a building may be significantly different from the concentration in an adjoining room the soil characteristics of the dwellings are the most important source of radon for the ground floor and higher concentration of indoor radon observed on lower floors most of the high radon concentrations have been reported from places near fault zones hence the existence of a relation between the exhalation rate from faults and indoor radon concentrations is obvious the distribution of radon concentrations will generally differ from room to room and the readings are averaged according to regulatory protocols indoor radon concentration is usually assumed to follow a log normal distribution on a given territory thus the geometric mean is generally used for estimating the average radon concentration in an area the mean concentration ranges from less than bq m to over bq m in some european countries typical geometric standard deviations found in studies range between and meaning given the rule that the radon concentration is expected to be more than a hundred times the mean concentration for to of the cases some of the highest radon hazard in the us is found in iowa and in the appalachian mountain areas in southeastern pennsylvania iowa has the highest average radon concentrations in the us due to significant glaciation that ground the granitic rocks from the canadian shield and deposited it as soils making up the rich iowa farmland many cities within the state such as iowa city have passed requirements for radon resistant construction in new homes the second highest readings in ireland were found in office buildings in the irish town of mallow county cork prompting local fears regarding lung cancer in a few places uranium tailings have been used for landfills and were subsequently built upon resulting in possible increased exposure to radon since radon is a colorless odorless gas the only way to know how much is present in the air or water is to perform tests in the us radon test kits are available to the public at retail stores such as hardware stores for home use and testing is available through licensed professionals who are often home inspectors efforts to reduce indoor radon levels are called radon mitigation in the us the epa recommends all houses be tested for radon in the uk under the housing health safety rating system hhsrs property owners have an obligation to evaluate potential risks and hazards to health and safety in a residential property industrial production radon is obtained as a by product of uraniferous ores processing after transferring into solutions of hydrochloric or hydrobromic acids the gas mixture extracted from the solutions contains h o he rn co h o and hydrocarbons the mixture is purified by passing it over copper at k c f to remove the h and the o and then koh and p o are used to remove the acids and moisture by sorption radon is condensed by liquid nitrogen and purified from residue gases by sublimation radon commercialization is regulated but it is available in small quantities for the calibration of rn measurement systems at a price in of almost us equivalent to in per milliliter of radium solution which only contains about picograms of actual radon at any given moment radon is produced by a solution of radium half life of years radium decays by alpha particle emission producing radon that collects over samples of radium at a rate of about mm day per gram of radium equilibrium is quickly achieved and radon is produced in a steady flow with an activity equal to that of the radium bq gaseous rn half life of about four days escapes from the capsule through diffusion concentration scale applications medical an early th century form of quackery was the treatment of maladies in a radiotorium it was a small sealed room for patients to be exposed to radon for its medicinal effects the carcinogenic nature of radon due to its ionizing radiation became apparent later radon s molecule damaging radioactivity has been used to kill cancerous cells but it does not increase the health of healthy cells the ionizing radiation causes the formation of free radicals which results in cell damage causing increased rates of illness including cancer exposure to radon has been suggested to mitigate autoimmune diseases such as arthritis in a process known as radiation hormesis as a result in the late th century and early st century health mines established in basin montana attracted people seeking relief from health problems such as arthritis through limited exposure to radioactive mine water and radon the practice is discouraged because of the well documented ill effects of high doses of radiation on the body radioactive water baths have been applied since in j chymov czech republic but even before radon discovery they were used in bad gastein austria radium rich springs are also used in traditional japanese onsen in misasa tottori prefecture drinking therapy is applied in bad brambach germany and during the early th century water from springs with radon in them was bottled and sold this water had little to no radon in it by the time it got to consumers due to radon s short half life inhalation therapy is carried out in gasteiner heilstollen austria in wierad w zdr j czerniawa zdr j kowary l dek zdr j poland in harghita b i romania and in boulder montana in the us and europe there are several radon spas where people sit for minutes or hours in a high radon atmosphere radon has been produced commercially for use in radiation therapy but for the most part has been replaced by radionuclides made in particle accelerators and nuclear reactors radon has been used in implantable seeds made of gold or glass primarily used to treat cancers known as brachytherapy the gold seeds were produced by filling a long tube with radon pumped from a radium source the tube being then divided into short sections by crimping and cutting the gold layer keeps the radon within and filters out the alpha and beta radiations while allowing the gamma rays to escape which kill the diseased tissue the activities might range from to millicuries per seed to mbq the gamma rays are produced by radon and the first short lived elements of its decay chain po pb bi po radon and its first decay products being very short lived the seed is left in place after half lives days radon radioactivity is at of its original level at this stage the predominant residual activity originates from the radon decay product pb whose half life years is times that of radon and its descendants bi and po scientific radon emanation from the soil varies with soil type and with surface uranium content so outdoor radon concentrations can be used to track air masses to a limited degree this fact has been put to use by some atmospheric scientists radon storm because of radon s rapid loss to air and comparatively rapid decay radon is used in hydrologic research that studies the interaction between groundwater and streams any significant concentration of radon in a stream is a good indicator that there are local inputs of groundwater radon soil concentration has been used in an experimental way to map buried close subsurface geological faults because concentrations are generally higher over the faults similarly it has found some limited use in prospecting for geothermal gradients some researchers have investigated changes in groundwater radon concentrations for earthquake prediction increases in radon were noted before the tashkent and mindoro earthquakes radon has a half life of approximately days which means that it can be found only shortly after it has been produced in the radioactive decay chain for this reason it has been hypothesized that increases in radon concentration is due to the generation of new cracks underground which would allow increased groundwater circulation flushing out radon the generation of new cracks might not unreasonably be assumed to precede major earthquakes in the s and s scientific measurements of radon emissions near faults found that earthquakes often occurred with no radon signal and radon was often detected with no earthquake to follow it was then dismissed by many as an unreliable indicator as of it was under investigation as a possible precursor by nasa radon is a known pollutant emitted from geothermal power stations because it is present in the material pumped from deep underground it disperses rapidly and no radiological hazard has been demonstrated in various investigations in addition typical systems re inject the material deep underground rather than releasing it at the surface so its environmental impact is minimal however similar things can be said about trivial releases from operating nuclear power plants in the s and s radon was used for industrial radiography other x ray sources which became available after world war ii quickly replaced radon for this application as they were lower in cost and had less hazard of alpha radiation health risks in mines radon decay products have been classified by the international agency for research on cancer as being carcinogenic to humans and as a gas that can be inhaled lung cancer is a particular concern for people exposed to elevated levels of radon for sustained periods during the s and s when safety standards requiring expensive ventilation in mines were not widely implemented radon exposure was linked to lung cancer among non smoking miners of uranium and other hard rock materials in what is now the czech republic and later among miners from the southwestern us and south australia despite these hazards being known in the early s this occupational hazard remained poorly managed in many mines until the s during this period several entrepreneurs opened former uranium mines in the us to the general public and advertised alleged health benefits from breathing radon gas underground health benefits claimed included pain sinus asthma and arthritis relief but these were proven to be false and the government banned such advertisements in since that time ventilation and other measures have been used to reduce radon levels in most affected mines that continue to operate in recent years the average annual exposure of uranium miners has fallen to levels similar to the concentrations inhaled in some homes this has reduced the risk of occupationally induced cancer from radon although health issues may persist for those who are currently employed in affected mines and for those who have been employed in them in the past as the relative risk for miners has decreased so has the ability to detect excess risks among that population residues from processing of uranium ore can also be a source of radon radon resulting from the high radium content in uncovered dumps and tailing ponds can be easily released into the atmosphere and affect people living in the vicinity in addition to lung cancer researchers have theorized a possible increased risk of leukemia due to radon exposure empirical support from studies of the general population is inconsistent and a study of uranium miners found a correlation between radon exposure and chronic lymphocytic leukemia miners as well as milling and ore transportation workers who worked in the uranium industry in the us between the s and may be eligible for compensation under the radiation exposure compensation act reca surviving relatives may also apply in cases where the formerly employed person is deceased not only uranium mines are affected by elevated levels of radon coal mines in particular are affected as well since coal may contain more uranium and thorium than commercially operational uranium mines domestic level exposure prolonged exposure to higher concentrations of radon has been linked to an increase in lung cancer since there has been investigations worldwide on how radon concentrations are estimated in the united states alone averages have been recorded to be at least bq meters cubed steck et al did a study on the variation between indoor and outdoor radon in iowa and minnesota higher radiation was found in a populated region rather than in unpopulated regions in central america as a whole in some northwestern iowa and southwestern minnesota counties the outdoor radon concentrations exceed the national average indoor radon concentrations despite the above average both minnesota and iowa s numbers were exceptionally close regardless of the distance accurate doses of radon is heavily needed to further understand the problems radon in total can have on a community it is understood that radon poisoning does lead to bad health and lung cancer but with further research controls could change results in radon emissions both inside and outside of housing units radon exposure mostly radon daughters has been linked to lung cancer in numerous case control studies performed in the us europe and china there are approximately deaths per year in the us due to radon induced lung cancers in slovenia a country with a high concentration of radon about people yearly die because of radon one of the most comprehensive radon studies performed in the us by dr r william field and colleagues found a increased lung cancer risk even at the protracted exposures at the epa s action level of pci l north american and european pooled analyses further support these findings however the discussion about the opposite results is still continuing especially a retrospective case control study of lung cancer risk which showed substantial cancer rate reduction for radon concentrations between and bq m most models of residential radon exposure are based on studies of miners and direct estimates of the risks posed to homeowners would be more desirable because of the difficulties of measuring the risk of radon relative to smoking models of their effect have often made use of them radon has been considered the second leading cause of lung cancer and leading environmental cause of cancer mortality by the epa with the first one being smoking others have reached similar conclusions for the united kingdom and france radon exposure in homes and offices may arise from certain subsurface rock formations and also from certain building materials e g some granites the greatest risk of radon exposure arises in buildings that are airtight insufficiently ventilated and have foundation leaks that allow air from the soil into basements and dwelling rooms thoron was measured at comparatively high concentrations in buildings with earthen architecture such as traditional half timbered houses and modern houses with clay wall finishes because of its short half life thoron occurs only close to the earthen surfaces as its sources whereas its progeny can be found throughout the indoor air of such buildings therefore radiation exposure occurs at any location within such houses in different dwellings with earthen architecture in germany a study found annual internal radiation doses due to the inhalation of thoron and its progeny of up to several milli sieverts action and reference level who presented in a recommended reference level the national reference level bq m for radon in dwellings the recommendation also says that where this is not possible bq m should be selected as the highest level a national reference level should not be a limit but should represent the maximum acceptable annual average radon concentration in a dwelling the actionable concentration of radon in a home varies depending on the organization doing the recommendation for example the epa encourages that action be taken at concentrations as low as bq m pci l and the european union recommends action be taken when concentrations reach bq m pci l for old houses and bq m pci l for new ones on july the uk s health protection agency issued new advice setting a target level of bq m whilst retaining an action level of bq m similar levels as in uk are published by norwegian radiation and nuclear safety authority dsa with the maximum limit for schools kindergartens and new dwellings set at bq m where bq m is set as the action level in all new housings preventative measures should be taken against radon accumulation inhalation and smoking results from epidemiological studies indicate that the risk of lung cancer increases with exposure to residential radon a well known example of source of error is smoking the main risk factor for lung cancer in the us cigarette smoking is estimated to cause to of all lung cancers according to the epa the risk of lung cancer for smokers is significant due to synergistic effects of radon and smoking for this population about people in a total of will die of lung cancer compared to people in a total of for people who have never smoked it cannot be excluded that the risk of non smokers should be primarily explained by an effect of radon radon like other known or suspected external risk factors for lung cancer is a threat for smokers and former smokers this was demonstrated by the european pooling study a commentary to the pooling study stated it is not appropriate to talk simply of a risk from radon in homes the risk is from smoking compounded by a synergistic effect of radon for smokers without smoking the effect seems to be so small as to be insignificant according to the european pooling study there is a difference in risk for the histological subtypes of lung cancer and radon exposure small cell lung carcinoma which has a high correlation with smoking have a higher risk after radon exposure for other histological subtypes such as adenocarcinoma the type that primarily affects non smokers the risk from radon appears to be lower a study of radiation from post mastectomy radiotherapy shows that the simple models previously used to assess the combined and separate risks from radiation and smoking need to be developed this is also supported by new discussion about the calculation method the linear no threshold model which routinely has been used a study from which included non smokers and a control group of non smokers showed that exposure to radon increased the risk of lung cancer in non smokers the group that had been exposed to tobacco smoke in the home appeared to have a much higher risk while those who were not exposed to passive smoking did not show any increased risk with increasing radon exposure ingestion the effects of radon if ingested are unknown although studies have found that its biological half life ranges from to minutes with removal at minutes in the us national research council investigated the issue of radon in drinking water the risk associated with ingestion was considered almost negligible water from underground sources may contain significant amounts of radon depending on the surrounding rock and soil conditions whereas surface sources generally do not ocean effects of radon the ocean surface only carries about ra where measurements of ra concentration have been over various continents the major importance of understanding ra flux from the ocean is to know that the increase use of radon is also circulating and increasing in the atmosphere ocean surface concentrations have an exchange within the atmosphere causing radon to increase through the air sea interface although areas tested were very shallow additional measurements in a wide variety of coastal regimes should help define the nature of radon observed as well as being ingested through drinking water radon is also released from water when temperature is increased pressure is decreased and when water is aerated optimum conditions for radon release and exposure occurred during showering water with a radon concentration of pci l can increase the indoor airborne radon concentration by pci l under normal conditions testing and mitigation there are relatively simple tests for radon gas in some countries these tests are methodically done in areas of known systematic hazards radon detection devices are commercially available digital radon detectors provide ongoing measurements giving both daily weekly short term and long term average readouts via a digital display short term radon test devices used for initial screening purposes are inexpensive in some cases free there are important protocols for taking short term radon tests and it is imperative that they be strictly followed the kit includes a collector that the user hangs in the lowest habitable floor of the house for two to seven days the user then sends the collector to a laboratory for analysis long term kits taking collections for up to one year or more are also available an open land test kit can test radon emissions from the land before construction begins radon concentrations can vary daily and accurate radon exposure estimates require long term average radon measurements in the spaces where an individual spends a significant amount of time radon levels fluctuate naturally due to factors like transient weather conditions so an initial test might not be an accurate assessment of a home s average radon level radon levels are at a maximum during the coolest part of the day when pressure differentials are greatest therefore a high result over pci l justifies repeating the test before undertaking more expensive abatement projects measurements between and pci l warrant a long term radon test measurements over pci l warrant only another short term test so that abatement measures are not unduly delayed purchasers of real estate are advised to delay or decline a purchase if the seller has not successfully abated radon to pci l or less because the half life of radon is only days removing or isolating the source will greatly reduce the hazard within a few weeks another method of reducing radon levels is to modify the building s ventilation generally the indoor radon concentrations increase as ventilation rates decrease in a well ventilated place the radon concentration tends to align with outdoor values typically bq m ranging from to bq m the four principal ways of reducing the amount of radon accumulating in a house are sub slab depressurization soil suction by increasing under floor ventilation improving the ventilation of the house and avoiding the transport of radon from the basement into living rooms installing a radon sump system in the basement installing a positive pressurization or positive supply ventilation system according to the epa the method to reduce radon primarily used is a vent pipe system and fan which pulls radon from beneath the house and vents it to the outside which is also called sub slab depressurization active soil depressurization or soil suction generally indoor radon can be mitigated by sub slab depressurization and exhausting such radon laden air to the outdoors away from windows and other building openings the epa generally recommends methods which prevent the entry of radon soil suction for example prevents radon from entering your home by drawing the radon from below the home and venting it through a pipe or pipes to the air above the home where it is quickly diluted and the epa does not recommend the use of sealing alone to reduce radon because by itself sealing has not been shown to lower radon levels significantly or consistently positive pressure ventilation systems can be combined with a heat exchanger to recover energy in the process of exchanging air with the outside and simply exhausting basement air to the outside is not necessarily a viable solution as this can actually draw radon gas into a dwelling homes built on a crawl space may benefit from a radon collector installed under a radon barrier a sheet of plastic that covers the crawl space for crawl spaces the epa states an effective method to reduce radon levels in crawl space homes involves covering the earth floor with a high density plastic sheet a vent pipe and fan are used to draw the radon from under the sheet and vent it to the outdoors this form of soil suction is called submembrane suction and when properly applied is the most effective way to reduce radon levels in crawl space homes ,86
Francium,Fr,francium is a chemical element with the symbol fr and atomic number it is extremely radioactive its most stable isotope francium originally called actinium k after the natural decay chain it appears in has a half life of only minutes it is the second most electropositive element behind only caesium and is the second rarest naturally occurring element after astatine the isotopes of francium decay quickly into astatine radium and radon the electronic structure of a francium atom is rn s and so the element is classed as an alkali metal bulk francium has never been seen because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column it is presumed that francium would appear as a highly reactive metal if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid obtaining such a sample is highly improbable since the extreme heat of decay resulting from its short half life would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element francium was discovered by marguerite perey in france from which the element takes its name in prior to its discovery it was referred to as eka caesium or ekacaesium because of its conjectured existence below caesium in the periodic table it was the last element first discovered in nature rather than by synthesis outside the laboratory francium is extremely rare with trace amounts found in uranium ores where the isotope francium in the family of uranium continually forms and decays as little as g exists at any given time throughout the earth s crust aside from francium and francium its other isotopes are entirely synthetic the largest amount produced in the laboratory was a cluster of more than atoms characteristics francium is one of the most unstable of the naturally occurring elements its longest lived isotope francium has a half life of only minutes the only comparable element is astatine whose most stable natural isotope astatine the alpha daughter of francium has a half life of seconds although synthetic astatine is much longer lived with a half life of hours all isotopes of francium decay into astatine radium or radon francium also has a shorter half life than the longest lived isotope of each synthetic element up to and including element dubnium francium is an alkali metal whose chemical properties mostly resemble those of caesium a heavy element with a single valence electron it has the highest equivalent weight of any element liquid francium if created should have a surface tension of n m at its melting point francium s melting point was estimated to be around c f a value of c f is also often encountered the melting point is uncertain because of the element s extreme rarity and radioactivity a different extrapolation based on dmitri mendeleev s method gave c f the estimated boiling point of c f is also uncertain the estimates c f and c f as well as the extrapolation from mendeleev s method of c f have also been suggested the density of francium is expected to be around g cm mendeleev s method extrapolates g cm linus pauling estimated the electronegativity of francium at on the pauling scale the same as caesium the value for caesium has since been refined to but there are no experimental data to allow a refinement of the value for francium francium has a slightly higher ionization energy than caesium kj mol as opposed to kj mol for caesium as would be expected from relativistic effects and this would imply that caesium is the less electronegative of the two francium should also have a higher electron affinity than caesium and the fr ion should be more polarizable than the cs ion compounds due to francium being very unstable its salts are only known to a small extent francium coprecipitates with several caesium salts such as caesium perchlorate which results in small amounts of francium perchlorate this coprecipitation can be used to isolate francium by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of lawrence e glendenin and c m nelson it will additionally coprecipitate with many other caesium salts including the iodate the picrate the tartrate also rubidium tartrate the chloroplatinate and the silicotungstate it also coprecipitates with silicotungstic acid and with perchloric acid without another alkali metal as a carrier which leads to other methods of separation francium perchlorate francium perchlorate is produced by the reaction of francium chloride and sodium perchlorate the francium perchlorate coprecipitates with caesium perchlorate this coprecipitation can be used to isolate francium by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of lawrence e glendenin and c m nelson however this method is unreliable in separating thallium which also coprecipitates with caesium francium perchlorate s entropy is expected to be e u j mol k francium halides francium halides are all soluble in water and are expected to be white solids they are expected to be produced by the reaction of the corresponding halogens for example francium chloride would be produced by the reaction of francium and chlorine francium chloride has been studied as a pathway to separate francium from other elements by using the high vapour pressure of the compound although francium fluoride would have a higher vapour pressure other compounds francium nitrate sulfate hydroxide carbonate acetate and oxalate are all soluble in water while the iodate picrate tartrate chloroplatinate and silicotungstate are insoluble the insolubility of these compounds are used to extract francium from other radioactive products such as zirconium niobium molybdenum tin antimony the method mentioned in the section above the csfr molecule is predicted to have francium at the negative end of the dipole unlike all known heterodiatomic alkali metal molecules francium superoxide fro is expected to have a more covalent character than its lighter congeners this is attributed to the p electrons in francium being more involved in the francium oxygen bonding the relativistic destabilisation of the p spinor may make francium compounds in oxidation states higher than possible such as frvf but this has not been experimentally confirmed the only double salt known of francium has the formula fr bi i isotopes there are known isotopes of francium ranging in atomic mass from to francium has seven metastable nuclear isomers francium and francium are the only isotopes that occur in nature with the former being far more common francium is the most stable isotope with a half life of minutes and it is highly unlikely that an isotope of francium with a longer half life will ever be discovered or synthesized francium is a fifth product of the uranium decay series as a daughter isotope of actinium thorium is the more common daughter francium then decays into radium by beta decay mev decay energy with a minor alpha decay path to astatine mev decay energy francium has a half life of minutes it is the ninth product of the neptunium decay series as a daughter isotope of actinium francium then decays into astatine by alpha decay mev decay energy although all primordial np is extinct the neptunium decay series continues to exist naturally in tiny traces due to n n knockout reactions in natural u the least stable ground state isotope is francium with a half life of s it undergoes a mev alpha decay to astatine its metastable isomer francium m is less stable still with a half life of only ns applications due to its instability and rarity there are no commercial applications for francium it has been used for research purposes in the fields of chemistry and of atomic structure its use as a potential diagnostic aid for various cancers has also been explored but this application has been deemed impractical francium s ability to be synthesized trapped and cooled along with its relatively simple atomic structure has made it the subject of specialized spectroscopy experiments these experiments have led to more specific information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles studies on the light emitted by laser trapped francium ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels which are fairly similar to those predicted by quantum theory history as early as chemists thought that there should be an alkali metal beyond caesium with an atomic number of it was then referred to by the provisional name eka caesium research teams attempted to locate and isolate this missing element and at least four false claims were made that the element had been found before an authentic discovery was made erroneous and incomplete discoveries soviet chemist dmitry dobroserdov was the first scientist to claim to have found eka caesium or francium in he observed weak radioactivity in a sample of potassium another alkali metal and incorrectly concluded that eka caesium was contaminating the sample the radioactivity from the sample was from the naturally occurring potassium radioisotope potassium he then published a thesis on his predictions of the properties of eka caesium in which he named the element russium after his home country shortly thereafter dobroserdov began to focus on his teaching career at the polytechnic institute of odessa and he did not pursue the element further the following year english chemists gerald j f druce and frederick h loring analyzed x ray photographs of manganese ii sulfate they observed spectral lines which they presumed to be of eka caesium they announced their discovery of element and proposed the name alkalinium as it would be the heaviest alkali metal in fred allison of the alabama polytechnic institute claimed to have discovered element in addition to when analyzing pollucite and lepidolite using his magneto optical machine allison requested that it be named virginium after his home state of virginia along with the symbols vi and vm in h g macpherson of uc berkeley disproved the effectiveness of allison s device and the validity of his discovery in romanian physicist horia hulubei and his french colleague yvette cauchois also analyzed pollucite this time using their high resolution x ray apparatus they observed several weak emission lines which they presumed to be those of element hulubei and cauchois reported their discovery and proposed the name moldavium along with the symbol ml after moldavia the romanian province where hulubei was born in hulubei s work was criticized by american physicist f h hirsh jr who rejected hulubei s research methods hirsh was certain that eka caesium would not be found in nature and that hulubei had instead observed mercury or bismuth x ray lines hulubei insisted that his x ray apparatus and methods were too accurate to make such a mistake because of this jean baptiste perrin nobel prize winner and hulubei s mentor endorsed moldavium as the true eka caesium over marguerite perey s recently discovered francium perey took pains to be accurate and detailed in her criticism of hulubei s work and finally she was credited as the sole discoverer of element all other previous purported discoveries of element were ruled out due to francium s very limited half life perey s analysis eka caesium was discovered on january by marguerite perey of the curie institute in paris when she purified a sample of actinium which had been reported to have a decay energy of kev perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below kev perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product one which was separated during purification but emerged again out of the pure actinium various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium radium lead bismuth or thallium the new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal such as coprecipitating with caesium salts which led perey to believe that it was element produced by the alpha decay of actinium perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium her first test put the alpha branching at a figure which she later revised to perey named the new isotope actinium k it is now referred to as francium and in she proposed the name catium cm for her newly discovered element as she believed it to be the most electropositive cation of the elements ir ne joliot curie one of perey s supervisors opposed the name due to its connotation of cat rather than cation furthermore the symbol coincided with that which had since been assigned to curium perey then suggested francium after france this name was officially adopted by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac in becoming the second element after gallium to be named after france it was assigned the symbol fa but this abbreviation was revised to the current fr shortly thereafter francium was the last element discovered in nature rather than synthesized following hafnium and rhenium further research into francium s structure was carried out by among others sylvain lieberman and his team at cern in the s and s occurrence fr is the result of the alpha decay of ac and can be found in trace amounts in uranium minerals in a given sample of uranium there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every uranium atoms it is also calculated that there is a total mass of at most g or as other sources suggest to g of francium in the earth s crust at any given time production francium can be synthesized by a fusion reaction when a gold target is bombarded with a beam of oxygen atoms from a linear accelerator in a process originally developed at the physics department of the state university of new york at stony brook in depending on the energy of the oxygen beam the reaction can yield francium isotopes with masses of and au o fr n au o fr n au o fr n the francium atoms leave the gold target as ions which are neutralized by collision with yttrium and then isolated in a magneto optical trap mot in a gaseous unconsolidated state although the atoms only remain in the trap for about seconds before escaping or undergoing nuclear decay the process supplies a continual stream of fresh atoms the result is a steady state containing a fairly constant number of atoms for a much longer time the original apparatus could trap up to a few thousand atoms while a later improved design could trap over at a time sensitive measurements of the light emitted and absorbed by the trapped atoms provided the first experimental results on various transitions between atomic energy levels in francium initial measurements show very good agreement between experimental values and calculations based on quantum theory the research project using this production method relocated to triumf in where over francium atoms have been held at a time including large amounts of fr in addition to fr and fr other synthesis methods include bombarding radium with neutrons and bombarding thorium with protons deuterons or helium ions fr can also be isolated from samples of its parent ac the francium being milked via elution with nh cl cro from an actinium containing cation exchanger and purified by passing the solution through a silicon dioxide compound loaded with barium sulfate in the stony brook group trapped atoms in their mot which was enough for a video camera to capture the light given off by the atoms as they fluoresce francium has not been synthesized in amounts large enough to weigh ,87
Radium,Ra,radium is a chemical element with the symbol ra and atomic number it is the sixth element in group of the periodic table also known as the alkaline earth metals pure radium is silvery white but it readily reacts with nitrogen rather than oxygen upon exposure to air forming a black surface layer of radium nitride ra n all isotopes of radium are radioactive the most stable isotope being radium with a half life of years when radium decays it emits ionizing radiation as a by product which can excite fluorescent chemicals and cause radioluminescence radium in the form of radium chloride was discovered by marie and pierre curie in from ore mined at j chymov they extracted the radium compound from uraninite and published the discovery at the french academy of sciences five days later radium was isolated in its metallic state by marie curie and andr louis debierne through the electrolysis of radium chloride in in nature radium is found in uranium and to a lesser extent thorium ores in trace amounts as small as a seventh of a gram per ton of uraninite radium is not necessary for living organisms and adverse health effects are likely when it is incorporated into biochemical processes because of its radioactivity and chemical reactivity as of other than its use in nuclear medicine radium has no commercial applications formerly around the s it was used as a radioactive source for radioluminescent devices and also in radioactive quackery for its supposed curative power these applications have become obsolete owing to radium s toxicity as of less dangerous isotopes of other elements are instead used in radioluminescent devices bulk properties radium is the heaviest known alkaline earth metal and is the only radioactive member of its group its physical and chemical properties most closely resemble its lighter congener barium pure radium is a volatile silvery white metal although its lighter congeners calcium strontium and barium have a slight yellow tint this tint rapidly vanishes on exposure to air yielding a black layer of radium nitride ra n its melting point is either c f or c f and its boiling point is c f however this is not well established both of these values are slightly lower than those of barium confirming periodic trends down the group elements like barium and the alkali metals radium crystallizes in the body centered cubic structure at standard temperature and pressure the radium radium bond distance is picometers radium has a density of g cm higher than that of barium again confirming periodic trends the radium barium density ratio is comparable to the radium barium atomic mass ratio due to the two elements similar crystal structures isotopes radium has known isotopes with mass numbers from to all of them are radioactive four of these ra half life days ra days ra years and ra years occur naturally in the decay chains of primordial thorium uranium and uranium ra from uranium ra from uranium and the other two from thorium these isotopes nevertheless still have half lives too short to be primordial radionuclides and only exist in nature from these decay chains together with the mostly artificial ra d which occurs in nature only as a decay product of minute traces of neptunium these are the five most stable isotopes of radium all other known radium isotopes have half lives under two hours and the majority have half lives under a minute at least nuclear isomers have been reported the most stable of them is radium m with a half life between and milliseconds this is still shorter than twenty four ground state radium isotopes in the early history of the study of radioactivity the different natural isotopes of radium were given different names in this scheme ra was named actinium x acx ra thorium x thx ra radium ra and ra mesothorium msth when it was realized that all of these are isotopes of the same element many of these names fell out of use and radium came to refer to all isotopes not just ra some of radium s decay products received historical names including radium ranging from radium a to radium g with the letter indicating approximately how far they were down the chain from their parent ra radium emanation rn raa po rab pb rac bi rac po rac tl rad pb rae bi raf po and rag pb ra is the most stable isotope of radium and is the last isotope in the n decay chain of uranium with a half life of over a millennium it makes up almost all of natural radium its immediate decay product is the dense radioactive noble gas radon specifically the isotope rn which is responsible for much of the danger of environmental radium it is million times more radioactive than the same molar amount of natural uranium mostly uranium due to its proportionally shorter half life a sample of radium metal maintains itself at a higher temperature than its surroundings because of the radiation it emits alpha particles beta particles and gamma rays more specifically natural radium which is mostly ra emits mostly alpha particles but other steps in its decay chain the uranium or radium series emit alpha or beta particles and almost all particle emissions are accompanied by gamma rays in it was discovered at cern that the nucleus of radium is pear shaped using a technique called coulomb excitation this was the first discovery of an asymmetric nucleus this is a strong circumstantial evidence that certain heavy unstable atomic nuclei have distorted nuclei in this case a pear shape chemistry radium like barium is a highly reactive metal and always exhibits its group oxidation state of it forms the colorless ra cation in aqueous solution which is highly basic and does not form complexes readily most radium compounds are therefore simple ionic compounds though participation from the s and p electrons in addition to the valence s electrons is expected due to relativistic effects and would enhance the covalent character of radium compounds such as raf and raat for this reason the standard electrode potential for the half reaction ra aq e ra s is v even slightly lower than the value v for barium whereas the values had previously smoothly increased down the group ca v sr v ba v the values for barium and radium are almost exactly the same as those of the heavier alkali metals potassium rubidium and caesium compounds solid radium compounds are white as radium ions provide no specific coloring but they gradually turn yellow and then dark over time due to self radiolysis from radium s alpha decay insoluble radium compounds coprecipitate with all barium most strontium and most lead compounds radium oxide rao has not been characterized well past its existence despite oxides being common compounds for the other alkaline earth metals radium hydroxide ra oh is the most readily soluble among the alkaline earth hydroxides and is a stronger base than its barium congener barium hydroxide it is also more soluble than actinium hydroxide and thorium hydroxide these three adjacent hydroxides may be separated by precipitating them with ammonia radium chloride racl is a colorless luminous compound it becomes yellow after some time due to self damage by the alpha radiation given off by radium when it decays small amounts of barium impurities give the compound a rose color it is soluble in water though less so than barium chloride and its solubility decreases with increasing concentration of hydrochloric acid crystallization from aqueous solution gives the dihydrate racl h o isomorphous with its barium analog radium bromide rabr is also a colorless luminous compound in water it is more soluble than radium chloride like radium chloride crystallization from aqueous solution gives the dihydrate rabr h o isomorphous with its barium analog the ionizing radiation emitted by radium bromide excites nitrogen molecules in the air making it glow the alpha particles emitted by radium quickly gain two electrons to become neutral helium which builds up inside and weakens radium bromide crystals this effect sometimes causes the crystals to break or even explode radium nitrate ra no is a white compound that can be made by dissolving radium carbonate in nitric acid as the concentration of nitric acid increases the solubility of radium nitrate decreases an important property for the chemical purification of radium radium forms much the same insoluble salts as its lighter congener barium it forms the insoluble sulfate raso the most insoluble known sulfate chromate racro carbonate raco iodate ra io tetrafluoroberyllate rabef and nitrate ra no with the exception of the carbonate all of these are less soluble in water than the corresponding barium salts but they are all isostructural to their barium counterparts additionally radium phosphate oxalate and sulfite are probably also insoluble as they coprecipitate with the corresponding insoluble barium salts the great insolubility of radium sulfate at c only mg will dissolve in kg of water means that it is one of the less biologically dangerous radium compounds the large ionic radius of ra pm results in weak complexation and poor extraction of radium from aqueous solutions when not at high ph occurrence all isotopes of radium have half lives much shorter than the age of the earth so that any primordial radium would have decayed long ago radium nevertheless still occurs in the environment as the isotopes ra ra ra and ra are part of the decay chains of natural thorium and uranium isotopes since thorium and uranium have very long half lives these daughters are continually being regenerated by their decay of these four isotopes the longest lived is ra half life years a decay product of natural uranium because of its relative longevity ra is the most common isotope of the element making up about one part per trillion of the earth s crust essentially all natural radium is ra thus radium is found in tiny quantities in the uranium ore uraninite and various other uranium minerals and in even tinier quantities in thorium minerals one ton of pitchblende typically yields about one seventh of a gram of radium one kilogram of the earth s crust contains about picograms of radium and one liter of sea water contains about femtograms of radium history radium was discovered by marie sk odowska curie and her husband pierre curie on december in a uraninite pitchblende sample from j chymov while studying the mineral earlier the curies removed uranium from it and found that the remaining material was still radioactive in july while studying pitchblende they isolated an element similar to bismuth which turned out to be polonium they then isolated a radioactive mixture consisting of two components compounds of barium which gave a brilliant green flame color and unknown radioactive compounds which gave carmine spectral lines that had never been documented before the curies found the radioactive compounds to be very similar to the barium compounds except they were less soluble this discovery made it possible for the curies to isolate the radioactive compounds and discover a new element in them the curies announced their discovery to the french academy of sciences on december the naming of radium dates to about from the french word radium formed in modern latin from radius ray this was in recognition of radium s power of emitting energy in the form of rays in september marie curie and andr louis debierne announced that they had isolated radium as a pure metal through the electrolysis of pure radium chloride racl solution using a mercury cathode producing radium mercury amalgam this amalgam was then heated in an atmosphere of hydrogen gas to remove the mercury leaving pure radium metal later that same year e eoler isolated radium by thermal decomposition of its azide ra n radium metal was first industrially produced at the beginning of the th century by biraco a subsidiary company of union mini re du haut katanga umhk in its olen plant in belgium the general historical unit for radioactivity the curie is based on the radioactivity of ra it was originally defined as the radioactivity of one gram of radium but the definition was later slightly refined to be disintegrations per second historical applications luminescent paint radium was formerly used in self luminous paints for watches nuclear panels aircraft switches clocks and instrument dials a typical self luminous watch that uses radium paint contains around microgram of radium in the mid s a lawsuit was filed against the united states radium corporation by five dying radium girls dial painters who had painted radium based luminous paint on the dials of watches and clocks the dial painters were instructed to lick their brushes to give them a fine point thereby ingesting radium their exposure to radium caused serious health effects which included sores anemia and bone cancer during the litigation it was determined that the company s scientists and management had taken considerable precautions to protect themselves from the effects of radiation but it did not seem to protect their employees additionally for several years the companies had attempted to cover up the effects and avoid liability by insisting that the radium girls were instead suffering from syphilis this complete disregard for employee welfare had a significant impact on the formulation of occupational disease labor law as a result of the lawsuit the adverse effects of radioactivity became widely known and radium dial painters were instructed in proper safety precautions and provided with protective gear in particular dial painters no longer licked paint brushes to shape them which caused some ingestion of radium salts radium was still used in dials as late as the s but there were no further injuries to dial painters this highlighted that the harm to the radium girls could easily have been avoided from the s the use of radium paint was discontinued in many cases luminous dials were implemented with non radioactive fluorescent materials excited by light such devices glow in the dark after exposure to light but the glow fades where long lasting self luminosity in darkness was required safer radioactive promethium half life years or tritium half life years paint was used both continue to be used as of these had the added advantage of not degrading the phosphor over time unlike radium tritium emits very low energy beta radiation even lower energy than the beta radiation emitted by promethium which cannot penetrate the skin rather than the penetrating gamma radiation of radium and is regarded as safer clocks watches and instruments dating from the first half of the th century often in military applications may have been painted with radioactive luminous paint they are usually no longer luminous however this is not due to radioactive decay of the radium which has a half life of years but to the fluorescence of the zinc sulfide fluorescent medium being worn out by the radiation from the radium the appearance of an often thick layer of green or yellowish brown paint in devices from this period suggests a radioactive hazard the radiation dose from an intact device is relatively low and usually not an acute risk but the paint is dangerous if released and inhaled or ingested commercial use radium was once an additive in products such as toothpaste hair creams and even food items due to its supposed curative powers such products soon fell out of vogue and were prohibited by authorities in many countries after it was discovered they could have serious adverse health effects see for instance radithor or revigator types of radium water or standard radium solution for drinking spas featuring radium rich water are still occasionally touted as beneficial such as those in misasa tottori japan in the u s nasal radium irradiation was also administered to children to prevent middle ear problems or enlarged tonsils from the late s through the early s medical use radium usually in the form of radium chloride or radium bromide was used in medicine to produce radon gas which in turn was used as a cancer treatment for example several of these radon sources were used in canada in the s and s however many treatments that were used in the early s are not used anymore because of the harmful effects radium bromide exposure caused some examples of these effects are anaemia cancer and genetic mutations as of safer gamma emitters such as co which is less costly and available in larger quantities are usually used to replace the historical use of radium in this application early in the s biologists used radium to induce mutations and study genetics as early as daniel macdougal used radium in an attempt to determine whether it could provoke sudden large mutations and cause major evolutionary shifts thomas hunt morgan used radium to induce changes resulting in white eyed fruit flies nobel winning biologist hermann muller briefly studied the effects of radium on fruit fly mutations before turning to more affordable x ray experiments howard atwood kelly one of the founding physicians of johns hopkins hospital was a major pioneer in the medical use of radium to treat cancer his first patient was his own aunt in who died shortly after surgery kelly was known to use excessive amounts of radium to treat various cancers and tumors as a result some of his patients died from radium exposure his method of radium application was inserting a radium capsule near the affected area then sewing the radium points directly to the tumor this was the same method used to treat henrietta lacks the host of the original hela cells for cervical cancer as of safer and more available radioisotopes are used instead production uranium had no large scale application in the late th century and therefore no large uranium mines existed in the beginning the only large source for uranium ore was the silver mines in j chymov austria hungary now czech republic the uranium ore was only a byproduct of the mining activities in the first extraction of radium curie used the residues after extraction of uranium from pitchblende the uranium had been extracted by dissolution in sulfuric acid leaving radium sulfate which is similar to barium sulfate but even less soluble in the residues the residues also contained rather substantial amounts of barium sulfate which thus acted as a carrier for the radium sulfate the first steps of the radium extraction process involved boiling with sodium hydroxide followed by hydrochloric acid treatment to minimize impurities of other compounds the remaining residue was then treated with sodium carbonate to convert the barium sulfate into barium carbonate carrying the radium thus making it soluble in hydrochloric acid after dissolution the barium and radium were reprecipitated as sulfates this was then repeated to further purify the mixed sulfate some impurities that form insoluble sulfides were removed by treating the chloride solution with hydrogen sulfide followed by filtering when the mixed sulfates were pure enough they were once more converted to mixed chlorides barium and radium thereafter were separated by fractional crystallisation while monitoring the progress using a spectroscope radium gives characteristic red lines in contrast to the green barium lines and the electroscope after the isolation of radium by marie and pierre curie from uranium ore from j chymov several scientists started to isolate radium in small quantities later small companies purchased mine tailings from j chymov mines and started isolating radium in the austrian government nationalised the mines and stopped exporting raw ore until when radium production increased radium availability was low the formation of an austrian monopoly and the strong urge of other countries to have access to radium led to a worldwide search for uranium ores the united states took over as leading producer in the early s the carnotite sands in colorado provide some of the element but richer ores are found in the congo and the area of the great bear lake and the great slave lake of northwestern canada neither of the deposits is mined for radium but the uranium content makes mining profitable the curies process was still used for industrial radium extraction in but mixed bromides were then used for the fractionation if the barium content of the uranium ore is not high enough it is easy to add some to carry the radium these processes were applied to high grade uranium ores but may not work well with low grade ores small amounts of radium were still extracted from uranium ore by this method of mixed precipitation and ion exchange as late as the s but as of they are extracted only from spent nuclear fuel in the total worldwide supply of purified radium amounted to about pounds kg and it is still in this range in while the annual production of pure radium compounds is only about g in total as of the chief radium producing countries are belgium canada the czech republic slovakia the united kingdom and russia the amounts of radium produced were and are always relatively small for example in g of radium were produced in the united states the metal is isolated by reducing radium oxide with aluminium metal in a vacuum at c modern applications radium is seeing increasing use in the field of atomic molecular and optical physics symmetry breaking forces scale proportional to z displaystyle z which makes radium the heaviest alkaline earth element well suited for constraining new physics beyond the standard model some radium isotopes such as radium have octupole deformed parity doublets that enhance sensitivity to charge parity violating new physics by two to three orders of magnitude compared to hg radium is also promising for a trapped ion optical clock the radium ion has two subhertz linewidth transitions from the s s displaystyle s s ground state that could serve as the clock transition in an optical clock additionally radium could be particularly well suited for a transportable optical clock as all transitions necessary for clock operation can be addressed with direct diode lasers though radium has no stable isotopes there are eleven radium isotopes with half lives longer than one minute that could be compared with high precision on a king plot isotope shifts could be measured with high precision on either of the radium ion subhertz linewidth transitions from the ground state or on the s displaystyle s to p displaystyle p intercombination line in neutral radium the degree of any potential nonlinearities in such a king plot could set bounds on new physics beyond the standard model some of the few practical uses of radium are derived from its radioactive properties more recently discovered radioisotopes such as cobalt and caesium are replacing radium in even these limited uses because several of these isotopes are more powerful emitters safer to handle and available in more concentrated form the isotope ra the chloride is under the trade name xofigo was approved by the united states food and drug administration in for use in medicine as a cancer treatment of bone metastasis the main indication of treatment with xofigo is the therapy of bony metastases from castration resistant prostate cancer due to the favourable characteristics of this alpha emitter radiopharmaceutical ra has also been used in experiments concerning therapeutic irradiation as it is the only reasonably long lived radium isotope which does not have radon as one of its daughters radium is still used in as a radiation source in some industrial radiography devices to check for flawed metallic parts similarly to x ray imaging when mixed with beryllium radium acts as a neutron source as of radium beryllium neutron sources are still sometimes used but other materials such as polonium are more common about polonium beryllium neutron sources with an individual activity of ci tbq have been used annually in russia these rabef based n neutron sources have been deprecated despite the high number of neutrons they emit neutrons per second in favour of am be sources as of the isotope ra is mainly used to form ac by neutron irradiation in a nuclear reactor hazards radium is highly radioactive and its immediate daughter radon gas is also radioactive when ingested of the ingested radium leaves the body through the feces while the other goes into the bloodstream mostly accumulating in the bones this is because the body treats radium as calcium and deposits it in the bones where radioactivity degrades marrow and can mutate bone cells exposure to radium internal or external can cause cancer and other disorders because radium and radon emit alpha and gamma rays upon their decay which kill and mutate cells at the time of the manhattan project in the tolerance dose for workers was set at micrograms of ingested radium some of the biological effects of radium include the first case of radium dermatitis reported in two years after the element s discovery the french physicist antoine becquerel carried a small ampoule of radium in his waistcoat pocket for six hours and reported that his skin became ulcerated pierre and marie curie were so intrigued by radiation that they sacrificed their own health to learn more about it pierre curie attached a tube filled with radium to his arm for ten hours which resulted in the appearance of a skin lesion suggesting the use of radium to attack cancerous tissue as it had attacked healthy tissue handling of radium has been blamed for marie curie s death due to aplastic anemia a significant amount of radium s danger comes from its daughter radon being a gas it can enter the body far more readily than can its parent radium as of ra is considered to be the most toxic of the quantity radioelements and it must be handled in tight glove boxes with significant airstream circulation that is then treated to avoid escape of its daughter rn to the environment old ampoules containing radium solutions must be opened with care because radiolytic decomposition of water can produce an overpressure of hydrogen and oxygen gas the world s largest concentration of ra is stored within the interim waste containment structure approximately mi km north of niagara falls new york the maximum contaminant level mcl for radium is pci l for drinking water however the osha doesn t set a exposure limit as there is a radiation limit already set up ,88
Actinium,Ac,actinium is a chemical element with the symbol ac and atomic number it was first isolated by friedrich oskar giesel in who gave it the name emanium the element got its name by being wrongly identified with a substance andr louis debierne found in and called actinium actinium gave the name to the actinide series a group of similar elements between actinium and lawrencium in the periodic table together with polonium radium and radon actinium was one of the first non primordial radioactive elements to be isolated a soft silvery white radioactive metal actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation as with most lanthanides and many actinides actinium assumes oxidation state in nearly all its chemical compounds actinium is found only in traces in uranium and thorium ores as the isotope ac which decays with a half life of years predominantly emitting beta and sometimes alpha particles and ac which is beta active with a half life of hours one tonne of natural uranium in ore contains about milligrams of actinium and one tonne of thorium contains about nanograms of actinium the close similarity of physical and chemical properties of actinium and lanthanum makes separation of actinium from the ore impractical instead the element is prepared in milligram amounts by the neutron irradiation of ra in a nuclear reactor owing to its scarcity high price and radioactivity actinium has no significant industrial use its current applications include a neutron source and an agent for radiation therapy history andr louis debierne a french chemist announced the discovery of a new element in he separated it from pitchblende residues left by marie and pierre curie after they had extracted radium in debierne described the substance as similar to titanium and in as similar to thorium friedrich oskar giesel found in a substance similar to lanthanum and called it emanium in after a comparison of the substances half lives determined by debierne harriet brooks in and otto hahn and otto sackur in debierne s chosen name for the new element was retained because it had seniority despite the contradicting chemical properties he claimed for the element at different times articles published in the s and later suggest that debierne s results published in conflict with those reported in and furthermore the now known chemistry of actinium precludes its presence as anything other than a minor constituent of debierne s and results in fact the chemical properties he reported make it likely that he had instead accidentally identified protactinium which would not be discovered for another fourteen years only to have it disappear due to its hydrolysis and adsorption onto his laboratory equipment this has led some authors to advocate that giesel alone should be credited with the discovery a less confrontational vision of scientific discovery is proposed by adloff he suggests that hindsight criticism of the early publications should be mitigated by the then nascent state of radiochemistry highlighting the prudence of debierne s claims in the original papers he notes that nobody can contend that debierne s substance did not contain actinium debierne who is now considered by the vast majority of historians as the discoverer lost interest in the element and left the topic giesel on the other hand can rightfully be credited with the first preparation of radiochemically pure actinium and with the identification of its atomic number the name actinium originates from the ancient greek aktis aktinos meaning beam or ray its symbol ac is also used in abbreviations of other compounds that have nothing to do with actinium such as acetyl acetate and sometimes acetaldehyde properties actinium is a soft silvery white radioactive metallic element its estimated shear modulus is similar to that of lead owing to its strong radioactivity actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation the first element of the actinides actinium gave the set its name much as lanthanum had done for the lanthanides the actinides are much more diverse than the lanthanides and therefore it was not until that the most significant change to dmitri mendeleev s periodic table since the recognition of the lanthanides the introduction of the actinides was generally accepted after glenn t seaborg s research on the transuranium elements although it had been proposed as early as by british chemist henry bassett actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that impedes further oxidation as with most lanthanides and actinides actinium exists in the oxidation state and the ac ions are colorless in solutions the oxidation state originates from the rn d s electronic configuration of actinium with three valence electrons that are easily donated to give the stable closed shell structure of the noble gas radon although the f orbitals are unoccupied in an actinium atom it can be used as a valence orbital in actinium complexes and hence actinium is generally regarded by chemists working on it as the first f element ac is the largest of all known tripositive ions and its first coordination sphere contains approximately water molecules chemical compounds due to actinium s intense radioactivity only a limited number of actinium compounds are known these include acf accl acbr acof acocl acobr ac s ac o acpo and ac no except for acpo they are all similar to the corresponding lanthanum compounds they all contain actinium in the oxidation state in particular the lattice constants of the analogous lanthanum and actinium compounds differ by only a few percent here a b and c are lattice constants no is space group number and z is the number of formula units per unit cell density was not measured directly but calculated from the lattice parameters oxides actinium oxide ac o can be obtained by heating the hydroxide at c or the oxalate at c in vacuum its crystal lattice is isotypic with the oxides of most trivalent rare earth metals halides actinium trifluoride can be produced either in solution or in solid reaction the former reaction is carried out at room temperature by adding hydrofluoric acid to a solution containing actinium ions in the latter method actinium metal is treated with hydrogen fluoride vapors at c in an all platinum setup treating actinium trifluoride with ammonium hydroxide at c yields oxyfluoride acof whereas lanthanum oxyfluoride can be easily obtained by burning lanthanum trifluoride in air at c for an hour similar treatment of actinium trifluoride yields no acof and only results in melting of the initial product acf nh h o acof nh factinium trichloride is obtained by reacting actinium hydroxide or oxalate with carbon tetrachloride vapors at temperatures above c similar to oxyfluoride actinium oxychloride can be prepared by hydrolyzing actinium trichloride with ammonium hydroxide at c however in contrast to the oxyfluoride the oxychloride could well be synthesized by igniting a solution of actinium trichloride in hydrochloric acid with ammonia reaction of aluminium bromide and actinium oxide yields actinium tribromide ac o albr acbr al o and treating it with ammonium hydroxide at c results in the oxybromide acobr other compounds actinium hydride was obtained by reduction of actinium trichloride with potassium at c and its structure was deduced by analogy with the corresponding lah hydride the source of hydrogen in the reaction was uncertain mixing monosodium phosphate nah po with a solution of actinium in hydrochloric acid yields white colored actinium phosphate hemihydrate acpo h o and heating actinium oxalate with hydrogen sulfide vapors at c for a few minutes results in a black actinium sulfide ac s it may possibly be produced by acting with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide on actinium oxide at c isotopes naturally occurring actinium is composed of two radioactive isotopes ac from the radioactive family of u and ac a granddaughter of th ac decays mainly as a beta emitter with a very small energy but in of cases it emits an alpha particle so it can readily be identified through alpha spectrometry thirty six radioisotopes have been identified the most stable being ac with a half life of years ac with a half life of days and ac with a half life of hours all remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are less than hours and the majority of them have half lives shorter than one minute the shortest lived known isotope of actinium is ac half life of nanoseconds which decays through alpha decay actinium also has two known meta states the most significant isotopes for chemistry are ac ac and ac purified ac comes into equilibrium with its decay products after about a half of year it decays according to its year half life emitting mostly beta and some alpha particles the successive decay products are part of the actinium series owing to the low available amounts low energy of its beta particles maximum kev and low intensity of alpha radiation ac is difficult to detect directly by its emission and it is therefore traced via its decay products the isotopes of actinium range in atomic weight from u ac to u ac occurrence and synthesis actinium is found only in traces in uranium ores one tonne of uranium in ore contains about milligrams of ac and in thorium ores which contain about nanograms of ac per one tonne of thorium the actinium isotope ac is a transient member of the uranium actinium series decay chain which begins with the parent isotope u or pu and ends with the stable lead isotope pb the isotope ac is a transient member of the thorium series decay chain which begins with the parent isotope th and ends with the stable lead isotope pb another actinium isotope ac is transiently present in the neptunium series decay chain beginning with np or u and ending with thallium tl and near stable bismuth bi even though all primordial np has decayed away it is continuously produced by neutron knock out reactions on natural u the low natural concentration and the close similarity of physical and chemical properties to those of lanthanum and other lanthanides which are always abundant in actinium bearing ores render separation of actinium from the ore impractical and complete separation was never achieved instead actinium is prepared in milligram amounts by the neutron irradiation of ra in a nuclear reactor ra n ra min ac displaystyle ce ra n ra beta ce min ac the reaction yield is about of the radium weight ac can further capture neutrons resulting in small amounts of ac after the synthesis actinium is separated from radium and from the products of decay and nuclear fusion such as thorium polonium lead and bismuth the extraction can be performed with thenoyltrifluoroacetone benzene solution from an aqueous solution of the radiation products and the selectivity to a certain element is achieved by adjusting the ph to about for actinium an alternative procedure is anion exchange with an appropriate resin in nitric acid which can result in a separation factor of for radium and actinium vs thorium in a two stage process actinium can then be separated from radium with a ratio of about using a low cross linking cation exchange resin and nitric acid as eluant ac was first produced artificially at the institute for transuranium elements itu in germany using a cyclotron and at st george hospital in sydney using a linac in this rare isotope has potential applications in radiation therapy and is most efficiently produced by bombarding a radium target with mev deuterium ions this reaction also yields ac which however decays with a half life of hours and thus does not contaminate ac actinium metal has been prepared by the reduction of actinium fluoride with lithium vapor in vacuum at a temperature between and c higher temperatures resulted in evaporation of the product and lower ones lead to an incomplete transformation lithium was chosen among other alkali metals because its fluoride is most volatile applications owing to its scarcity high price and radioactivity ac currently has no significant industrial use but ac is currently being studied for use in cancer treatments such as targeted alpha therapies ac is highly radioactive and was therefore studied for use as an active element of radioisotope thermoelectric generators for example in spacecraft the oxide of ac pressed with beryllium is also an efficient neutron source with the activity exceeding that of the standard americium beryllium and radium beryllium pairs in all those applications ac a beta source is merely a progenitor which generates alpha emitting isotopes upon its decay beryllium captures alpha particles and emits neutrons owing to its large cross section for the n nuclear reaction be he c n displaystyle ce be he c n gamma the acbe neutron sources can be applied in a neutron probe a standard device for measuring the quantity of water present in soil as well as moisture density for quality control in highway construction such probes are also used in well logging applications in neutron radiography tomography and other radiochemical investigations ac is applied in medicine to produce bi in a reusable generator or can be used alone as an agent for radiation therapy in particular targeted alpha therapy tat this isotope has a half life of days making it much more suitable for radiation therapy than bi half life minutes additionally ac decays to nontoxic bi rather than stable but toxic lead which is the final product in the decay chains of several other candidate isotopes namely th th and u not only ac itself but also its daughters emit alpha particles which kill cancer cells in the body the major difficulty with application of ac was that intravenous injection of simple actinium complexes resulted in their accumulation in the bones and liver for a period of tens of years as a result after the cancer cells were quickly killed by alpha particles from ac the radiation from the actinium and its daughters might induce new mutations to solve this problem ac was bound to a chelating agent such as citrate ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta or diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid dtpa this reduced actinium accumulation in the bones but the excretion from the body remained slow much better results were obtained with such chelating agents as heha hexaazacyclohexadecane n n n n n n hexaacetic acid or dota tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid coupled to trastuzumab a monoclonal antibody that interferes with the her neu receptor the latter delivery combination was tested on mice and proved to be effective against leukemia lymphoma breast ovarian neuroblastoma and prostate cancers the medium half life of ac years makes it very convenient radioactive isotope in modeling the slow vertical mixing of oceanic waters the associated processes cannot be studied with the required accuracy by direct measurements of current velocities of the order meters per year however evaluation of the concentration depth profiles for different isotopes allows estimating the mixing rates the physics behind this method is as follows oceanic waters contain homogeneously dispersed u its decay product pa gradually precipitates to the bottom so that its concentration first increases with depth and then stays nearly constant pa decays to ac however the concentration of the latter isotope does not follow the pa depth profile but instead increases toward the sea bottom this occurs because of the mixing processes which raise some additional ac from the sea bottom thus analysis of both pa and ac depth profiles allows researchers to model the mixing behavior there are theoretical predictions that achx hydrides in this case with very high pressure are a candidate for a near room temperature superconductor as they have tc significantly higher than h s possibly near k precautions ac is highly radioactive and experiments with it are carried out in a specially designed laboratory equipped with a tight glove box when actinium trichloride is administered intravenously to rats about of actinium is deposited into the bones and into the liver its toxicity is comparable to but slightly lower than that of americium and plutonium for trace quantities fume hoods with good aeration suffice for gram amounts hot cells with shielding from the intense gamma radiation emitted by ac are necessary ,89
Thorium,Th,thorium is a weakly radioactive metallic chemical element with the symbol th and atomic number thorium is silvery and tarnishes black when it is exposed to air forming thorium dioxide it is moderately soft and malleable and has a high melting point thorium is an electropositive actinide whose chemistry is dominated by the oxidation state it is quite reactive and can ignite in air when finely divided all known thorium isotopes are unstable the most stable isotope th has a half life of billion years or about the age of the universe it decays very slowly via alpha decay starting a decay chain named the thorium series that ends at stable pb on earth thorium and uranium are the only significantly radioactive elements that still occur naturally in large quantities as primordial elements thorium is estimated to be over three times as abundant as uranium in the earth s crust and is chiefly refined from monazite sands as a by product of extracting rare earth metals thorium was discovered in by the norwegian amateur mineralogist morten thrane esmark and identified by the swedish chemist j ns jacob berzelius who named it after thor the norse god of thunder its first applications were developed in the late th century thorium s radioactivity was widely acknowledged during the first decades of the th century in the second half of the century thorium was replaced in many uses due to concerns about its radioactivity thorium is still being used as an alloying element in tig welding electrodes but is slowly being replaced in the field with different compositions it was also material in high end optics and scientific instrumentation used in some broadcast vacuum tubes and as the light source in gas mantles but these uses have become marginal it has been suggested as a replacement for uranium as nuclear fuel in nuclear reactors and several thorium reactors have been built thorium is also used in strengthening magnesium coating tungsten wire in electrical equipment controlling the grain size of tungsten in electric lamps high temperature crucibles and glasses including camera and scientific instrument lenses other uses for thorium include heat resistant ceramics aircraft engines and in light bulbs ocean science has utilised pa th isotope ratios to understand the ancient ocean bulk properties thorium is a moderately soft paramagnetic bright silvery radioactive actinide metal in the periodic table it lies to the right of actinium to the left of protactinium and below cerium pure thorium is very ductile and as normal for metals can be cold rolled swaged and drawn at room temperature thorium metal has a face centred cubic crystal structure it has two other forms one at high temperature over c body centred cubic and one at high pressure around gpa body centred tetragonal thorium metal has a bulk modulus a measure of resistance to compression of a material of gpa about the same as tin s gpa aluminium s is gpa copper s gpa and mild steel s is gpa thorium is about as hard as soft steel so when heated it can be rolled into sheets and pulled into wire thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium and is harder than both it becomes superconductive below k thorium s melting point of c is above both those of actinium c and protactinium c at the start of period from francium to thorium the melting points of the elements increase as in other periods because the number of delocalised electrons each atom contributes increases from one in francium to four in thorium leading to greater attraction between these electrons and the metal ions as their charge increases from one to four after thorium there is a new downward trend in melting points from thorium to plutonium where the number of f electrons increases from about to about this trend is due to the increasing hybridisation of the f and d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds resulting in more complex crystal structures and weakened metallic bonding the f electron count for thorium metal is a non integer due to a f d overlap among the actinides up to californium which can be studied in at least milligram quantities thorium has the highest melting and boiling points and second lowest density only actinium is lighter thorium s boiling point of c is the fifth highest among all the elements with known boiling points the properties of thorium vary widely depending on the degree of impurities in the sample the major impurity is usually thorium dioxide tho even the purest thorium specimens usually contain about a tenth of a percent of the dioxide experimental measurements of its density give values between and g cm these are slightly lower than the theoretically expected value of g cm calculated from thorium s lattice parameters perhaps due to microscopic voids forming in the metal when it is cast these values lie between those of its neighbours actinium g cm and protactinium g cm part of a trend across the early actinides thorium can form alloys with many other metals addition of small proportions of thorium improves the mechanical strength of magnesium and thorium aluminum alloys have been considered as a way to store thorium in proposed future thorium nuclear reactors thorium forms eutectic mixtures with chromium and uranium and it is completely miscible in both solid and liquid states with its lighter congener cerium isotopes all but two elements up to bismuth element have an isotope that is practically stable for all purposes classically stable with the exceptions being technetium and promethium elements and all elements from polonium element onward are measurably radioactive th is one of the two nuclides beyond bismuth the other being u that have half lives measured in billions of years its half life is billion years about three times the age of the earth and slightly longer than the age of the universe four fifths of the thorium present at earth s formation has survived to the present th is the only isotope of thorium occurring in quantity in nature its stability is attributed to its closed nuclear subshell with neutrons thorium has a characteristic terrestrial isotopic composition with atomic weight it is one of only four radioactive elements along with bismuth protactinium and uranium that occur in large enough quantities on earth for a standard atomic weight to be determined thorium nuclei are susceptible to alpha decay because the strong nuclear force cannot overcome the electromagnetic repulsion between their protons the alpha decay of th initiates the n decay chain which includes isotopes with a mass number divisible by hence the name it is also called the thorium series after its progenitor this chain of consecutive alpha and beta decays begins with the decay of th to ra and terminates at pb any sample of thorium or its compounds contains traces of these daughters which are isotopes of thallium lead bismuth polonium radon radium and actinium natural thorium samples can be chemically purified to extract useful daughter nuclides such as pb which is used in nuclear medicine for cancer therapy th alpha emitter with an days half life can also be used in cancer treatments such as targeted alpha therapies th also very occasionally undergoes spontaneous fission rather than alpha decay and has left evidence of doing so in its minerals as trapped xenon gas formed as a fission product but the partial half life of this process is very large at over years and alpha decay predominates in total radioisotopes have been characterised which range in mass number from to after th the most stable of them with respective half lives are th years th years th years th days and th days all of these isotopes occur in nature as trace radioisotopes due to their presence in the decay chains of th u u and np the last of these is long extinct in nature due to its short half life million years but is continually produced in minute traces from neutron capture in uranium ores all of the remaining thorium isotopes have half lives that are less than thirty days and the majority of these have half lives that are less than ten minutes in deep seawaters the isotope th makes up to of natural thorium this is because its parent u is soluble in water but th is insoluble and precipitates into the sediment uranium ores with low thorium concentrations can be purified to produce gram sized thorium samples of which over a quarter is the th isotope since th is one of the daughters of u the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac reclassified thorium as a binuclidic element in it had formerly been considered a mononuclidic element thorium has three known nuclear isomers or metastable states m th m th and mth mth has the lowest known excitation energy of any isomer measured to be ev this is so low that when it undergoes isomeric transition the emitted gamma radiation is in the ultraviolet range different isotopes of thorium are chemically identical but have slightly differing physical properties for example the densities of pure th th th and th are respectively expected to be and g cm the isotope th is expected to be fissionable with a bare critical mass of kg although with steel reflectors this value could drop to kg th is not fissionable but it is fertile as it can be converted to fissile u by neutron capture and subsequent beta decay radiometric dating two radiometric dating methods involve thorium isotopes uranium thorium dating based on the decay of u to th and ionium thorium dating which measures the ratio of th to th these rely on the fact that th is a primordial radioisotope but th only occurs as an intermediate decay product in the decay chain of u uranium thorium dating is a relatively short range process because of the short half lives of u and th relative to the age of the earth it is also accompanied by a sister process involving the alpha decay of u into th which very quickly becomes the longer lived pa and this process is often used to check the results of uranium thorium dating uranium thorium dating is commonly used to determine the age of calcium carbonate materials such as speleothem or coral because uranium is more soluble in water than thorium and protactinium which are selectively precipitated into ocean floor sediments where their ratios are measured the scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years ionium thorium dating is a related process which exploits the insolubility of thorium both th and th and thus its presence in ocean sediments to date these sediments by measuring the ratio of th to th both of these dating methods assume that the proportion of th to th is a constant during the period when the sediment layer was formed that the sediment did not already contain thorium before contributions from the decay of uranium and that the thorium cannot migrate within the sediment layer chemistry a thorium atom has electrons of which four are valence electrons four atomic orbitals are theoretically available for the valence electrons to occupy f d s and p despite thorium s position in the f block of the periodic table it has an anomalous rn d s electron configuration in the ground state as the f and d subshells in the early actinides are very close in energy even more so than the f and d subshells of the lanthanides thorium s d subshells are lower in energy than its f subshells because its f subshells are not well shielded by the filled s and p subshells and are destabilized this is due to relativistic effects which become stronger near the bottom of the periodic table specifically the relativistic spin orbit interaction the closeness in energy levels of the f d and s energy levels of thorium results in thorium almost always losing all four valence electrons and occurring in its highest possible oxidation state of this is different from its lanthanide congener cerium in which is also the highest possible state but plays an important role and is more stable thorium is much more similar to the transition metals zirconium and hafnium than to cerium in its ionization energies and redox potentials and hence also in its chemistry this transition metal like behaviour is the norm in the first half of the actinide series despite the anomalous electron configuration for gaseous thorium atoms metallic thorium shows significant f involvement a hypothetical metallic state of thorium that had the rn d s configuration with the f orbitals above the fermi level should be hexagonal close packed like the group elements titanium zirconium and hafnium and not face centred cubic as it actually is the actual crystal structure can only be explained when the f states are invoked proving that thorium is metallurgically a true actinide tetravalent thorium compounds are usually colourless or yellow like those of silver or lead as the th ion has no f or d electrons thorium chemistry is therefore largely that of an electropositive metal forming a single diamagnetic ion with a stable noble gas configuration indicating a similarity between thorium and the main group elements of the s block thorium and uranium are the most investigated of the radioactive elements because their radioactivity is low enough not to require special handling in the laboratory reactivity thorium is a highly reactive and electropositive metal with a standard reduction potential of v for the th th couple it is somewhat more electropositive than zirconium or aluminium finely divided thorium metal can exhibit pyrophoricity spontaneously igniting in air when heated in air thorium turnings ignite and burn with a brilliant white light to produce the dioxide in bulk the reaction of pure thorium with air is slow although corrosion may occur after several months most thorium samples are contaminated with varying degrees of the dioxide which greatly accelerates corrosion such samples slowly tarnish becoming grey and finally black at the surface at standard temperature and pressure thorium is slowly attacked by water but does not readily dissolve in most common acids with the exception of hydrochloric acid where it dissolves leaving a black insoluble residue of tho oh cl h it dissolves in concentrated nitric acid containing a small quantity of catalytic fluoride or fluorosilicate ions if these are not present passivation by the nitrate can occur as with uranium and plutonium inorganic compounds most binary compounds of thorium with nonmetals may be prepared by heating the elements together in air thorium burns to form tho which has the fluorite structure thorium dioxide is a refractory material with the highest melting point c of any known oxide it is somewhat hygroscopic and reacts readily with water and many gases it dissolves easily in concentrated nitric acid in the presence of fluoride when heated in air thorium dioxide emits intense blue light the light becomes white when tho is mixed with its lighter homologue cerium dioxide ceo ceria this is the basis for its previously common application in gas mantles a flame is not necessary for this effect in it was discovered that a hot welsbach gas mantle using tho with ceo remained at full glow when exposed to a cold unignited mixture of flammable gas and air the light emitted by thorium dioxide is higher in wavelength than the blackbody emission expected from incandescence at the same temperature an effect called candoluminescence it occurs because tho ce acts as a catalyst for the recombination of free radicals that appear in high concentration in a flame whose deexcitation releases large amounts of energy the addition of cerium dioxide as in gas mantles heightens the effect by increasing emissivity in the visible region of the spectrum but because cerium unlike thorium can occur in multiple oxidation states its charge and hence visible emissivity will depend on the region on the flame it is found in as such regions vary in their chemical composition and hence how oxidising or reducing they are several binary thorium chalcogenides and oxychalcogenides are also known with sulfur selenium and tellurium all four thorium tetrahalides are known as are some low valent bromides and iodides the tetrahalides are all coordinated hygroscopic compounds that dissolve easily in polar solvents such as water many related polyhalide ions are also known thorium tetrafluoride has a monoclinic crystal structure like those of zirconium tetrafluoride and hafnium tetrafluoride where the th ions are coordinated with f ions in somewhat distorted square antiprisms the other tetrahalides instead have dodecahedral geometry lower iodides thi black and thi gold coloured can also be prepared by reducing the tetraiodide with thorium metal they do not contain th iii and th ii but instead contain th and could be more clearly formulated as electride compounds many polynary halides with the alkali metals barium thallium and ammonium are known for thorium fluorides chlorides and bromides for example when treated with potassium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid th forms the complex anion thf hexafluorothorate iv which precipitates as an insoluble salt k thf potassium hexafluorothorate iv thorium borides carbides silicides and nitrides are refractory materials like those of uranium and plutonium and have thus received attention as possible nuclear fuels all four heavier pnictogens phosphorus arsenic antimony and bismuth also form binary thorium compounds thorium germanides are also known thorium reacts with hydrogen to form the thorium hydrides thh and th h the latter of which is superconducting below k at standard temperature and pressure it conducts electricity like a metal the hydrides are thermally unstable and readily decompose upon exposure to air or moisture coordination compounds in an acidic aqueous solution thorium occurs as the tetrapositive aqua ion th h o which has tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry at ph the solutions of thorium salts are dominated by this cation the th ion is the largest of the tetrapositive actinide ions and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between and it is quite acidic due to its high charge slightly stronger than sulfurous acid thus it tends to undergo hydrolysis and polymerisation though to a lesser extent than fe predominantly to th oh in solutions with ph or below but in more alkaline solution polymerisation continues until the gelatinous hydroxide th oh forms and precipitates out though equilibrium may take weeks to be reached because the polymerisation usually slows down before the precipitation as a hard lewis acid th favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors complexes with sulfur atoms as donors are less stable and are more prone to hydrolysis high coordination numbers are the rule for thorium due to its large size thorium nitrate pentahydrate was the first known example of coordination number the oxalate tetrahydrate has coordination number and the borohydride first prepared in the manhattan project has coordination number these thorium salts are known for their high solubility in water and polar organic solvents many other inorganic thorium compounds with polyatomic anions are known such as the perchlorates sulfates sulfites nitrates carbonates phosphates vanadates molybdates and chromates and their hydrated forms they are important in thorium purification and the disposal of nuclear waste but most of them have not yet been fully characterized especially regarding their structural properties for example thorium nitrate is produced by reacting thorium hydroxide with nitric acid it is soluble in water and alcohols and is an important intermediate in the purification of thorium and its compounds thorium complexes with organic ligands such as oxalate citrate and edta are much more stable in natural thorium containing waters organic thorium complexes usually occur in concentrations orders of magnitude higher than the inorganic complexes even when the concentrations of inorganic ligands are much greater than those of organic ligands in january the aromaticity has been observed in a large metal cluster anion consisting of bismuth atoms stabilised by a center thorium cation this compound was shown to be surprisingly stable unlike many previous known aromatic metal clusters organothorium compounds most of the work on organothorium compounds has focused on the cyclopentadienyl complexes and cyclooctatetraenyls like many of the early and middle actinides up to americium and also expected for curium thorium forms a cyclooctatetraenide complex the yellow th c h thorocene it is isotypic with the better known analogous uranium compound uranocene it can be prepared by reacting k c h with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran thf at the temperature of dry ice or by reacting thorium tetrafluoride with mgc h it is unstable in air and decomposes in water or at c half sandwich compounds are also known such as c h thcl thf which has a piano stool structure and is made by reacting thorocene with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran the simplest of the cyclopentadienyls are th c h and th c h many derivatives are known the former which has two forms one purple and one green is a rare example of thorium in the formal oxidation state a formal oxidation state occurs in a derivative the chloride derivative th c h cl is prepared by heating thorium tetrachloride with limiting kc h used other univalent metal cyclopentadienyls can also be used the alkyl and aryl derivatives are prepared from the chloride derivative and have been used to study the nature of the th c sigma bond other organothorium compounds are not well studied tetrabenzylthorium th ch c h and tetraallylthorium th ch ch ch are known but their structures have not been determined they decompose slowly at room temperature thorium forms the monocapped trigonal prismatic anion th ch heptamethylthorate iv which forms the salt li tmeda th ch tmeda ch nch ch n ch although one methyl group is only attached to the thorium atom th c distance pm and the other six connect the lithium and thorium atoms th c distances pm they behave equivalently in solution tetramethylthorium th ch is not known but its adducts are stabilised by phosphine ligands occurrence formation th is a primordial nuclide having existed in its current form for over ten billion years it was formed during the r process which probably occurs in supernovae and neutron star mergers these violent events scattered it across the galaxy the letter r stands for rapid neutron capture and occurs in core collapse supernovae where heavy seed nuclei such as fe rapidly capture neutrons running up against the neutron drip line as neutrons are captured much faster than the resulting nuclides can beta decay back toward stability neutron capture is the only way for stars to synthesise elements beyond iron because of the increased coulomb barriers that make interactions between charged particles difficult at high atomic numbers and the fact that fusion beyond fe is endothermic because of the abrupt loss of stability past bi the r process is the only process of stellar nucleosynthesis that can create thorium and uranium all other processes are too slow and the intermediate nuclei alpha decay before they capture enough neutrons to reach these elements in the universe thorium is among the rarest of the primordial elements because it is one of the two elements that can be produced only in the r process the other being uranium and also because it has slowly been decaying away from the moment it formed the only primordial elements rarer than thorium are thulium lutetium tantalum and rhenium the odd numbered elements just before the third peak of r process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals as well as uranium in the distant past the abundances of thorium and uranium were enriched by the decay of plutonium and curium isotopes and thorium was enriched relative to uranium by the decay of u to th and the natural depletion of u but these sources have long since decayed and no longer contribute in the earth s crust thorium is much more abundant with an abundance of g tonne it is one of the most abundant of the heavy elements almost as abundant as lead g tonne and more abundant than tin g tonne this is because thorium is likely to form oxide minerals that do not sink into the core it is classified as a lithophile under the goldschmidt classification meaning that it is generally found combined with oxygen common thorium compounds are also poorly soluble in water thus even though the refractory elements have the same relative abundances in the earth as in the solar system as a whole there is more accessible thorium than heavy platinum group metals in the crust on earth thorium is the st most abundant element in the earth s crust natural thorium is usually almost pure th which is the longest lived and most stable isotope of thorium having a half life comparable to the age of the universe its radioactive decay is the largest single contributor to the earth s internal heat the other major contributors are the shorter lived primordial radionuclides which are u k and u in descending order of their contribution at the time of the earth s formation k and u contributed much more by virtue of their short half lives but they have decayed more quickly leaving the contribution from th and u predominant its decay accounts for a gradual decrease of thorium content of the earth the planet currently has around of the amount present at the formation of the earth the other natural thorium isotopes are much shorter lived of them only th is usually detectable occurring in secular equilibrium with its parent u and making up at most of natural thorium thorium only occurs as a minor constituent of most minerals and was for this reason previously thought to be rare in nature thorium occurs in the oxidation state together with uranium iv zirconium iv hafnium iv and cerium iv and also with scandium yttrium and the trivalent lanthanides which have similar ionic radii because of thorium s radioactivity minerals containing it are often metamict amorphous their crystal structure having been damaged by the alpha radiation produced by thorium an extreme example is ekanite ca fe pb th u si o which almost never occurs in nonmetamict form due to the thorium it contains monazite chiefly phosphates of various rare earth elements is the most important commercial source of thorium because it occurs in large deposits worldwide principally in india south africa brazil australia and malaysia it contains around thorium on average although some deposits may contain up to monazite is a chemically unreactive mineral that is found as yellow or brown sand its low reactivity makes it difficult to extract thorium from it allanite chiefly silicates hydroxides of various metals can have thorium and zircon chiefly zirconium silicate zrsio up to thorium thorium dioxide occurs as the rare mineral thorianite due to its being isotypic with uranium dioxide these two common actinide dioxides can form solid state solutions and the name of the mineral changes according to the tho content thorite chiefly thorium silicate thsio also has a high thorium content and is the mineral in which thorium was first discovered in thorium silicate minerals the th and sio ions are often replaced with m where m sc y or ln and phosphate po ions respectively because of the great insolubility of thorium dioxide thorium does not usually spread quickly through the environment when released the th ion is soluble especially in acidic soils and in such conditions the thorium concentration can be higher history erroneous report in the swedish chemist j ns jacob berzelius analysed an unusual sample of gadolinite from a copper mine in falun central sweden he noted impregnated traces of a white mineral which he cautiously assumed to be an earth oxide in modern chemical nomenclature of an unknown element berzelius had already discovered two elements cerium and selenium but he had made a public mistake once announcing a new element gahnium that turned out to be zinc oxide berzelius privately named the putative element thorium in and its supposed oxide thorina after thor the norse god of thunder in after more deposits of the same mineral in vest agder norway were discovered he retracted his findings as the mineral later named xenotime proved to be mostly yttrium orthophosphate discovery in morten thrane esmark found a black mineral on l v ya island telemark county norway he was a norwegian priest and amateur mineralogist who studied the minerals in telemark where he served as vicar he commonly sent the most interesting specimens such as this one to his father jens esmark a noted mineralogist and professor of mineralogy and geology at the royal frederick university in christiania today called oslo the elder esmark determined that it was not a known mineral and sent a sample to berzelius for examination berzelius determined that it contained a new element he published his findings in having isolated an impure sample by reducing k thf potassium pentafluorothorate iv with potassium metal berzelius reused the name of the previous supposed element discovery and named the source mineral thorite berzelius made some initial characterizations of the new metal and its chemical compounds he correctly determined that the thorium oxygen mass ratio of thorium oxide was its actual value is close to that but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent and so calculated that the atomic mass was times that of oxygen amu it is actually times as large he determined that thorium was a very electropositive metal ahead of cerium and behind zirconium in electropositivity metallic thorium was isolated for the first time in by dutch entrepreneurs dirk lely jr and lodewijk hamburger initial chemical classification in the periodic table published by dmitri mendeleev in thorium and the rare earth elements were placed outside the main body of the table at the end of each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals this reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare earth metals were divalent with the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group iv in which also contained the modern carbon group group and titanium group group because their maximum oxidation state was cerium was soon removed from the main body of the table and placed in a separate lanthanide series thorium was left with group as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group such as titanium and zirconium first uses while thorium was discovered in its first application dates only from when austrian chemist carl auer von welsbach invented the gas mantle a portable source of light which produces light from the incandescence of thorium oxide when heated by burning gaseous fuels many applications were subsequently found for thorium and its compounds including ceramics carbon arc lamps heat resistant crucibles and as catalysts for industrial chemical reactions such as the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid radioactivity thorium was first observed to be radioactive in by the german chemist gerhard carl schmidt and later that year independently by the polish french physicist marie curie it was the second element that was found to be radioactive after the discovery of radioactivity in uranium by french physicist henri becquerel starting from the new zealand physicist ernest rutherford and the american electrical engineer robert bowie owens studied the radiation from thorium initial observations showed that it varied significantly it was determined that these variations came from a short lived gaseous daughter of thorium which they found to be a new element this element is now named radon the only one of the rare radioelements to be discovered in nature as a daughter of thorium rather than uranium after accounting for the contribution of radon rutherford now working with the british physicist frederick soddy showed how thorium decayed at a fixed rate over time into a series of other elements in work dating from to this observation led to the identification of the half life as one of the outcomes of the alpha particle experiments that led to the disintegration theory of radioactivity the biological effect of radiation was discovered in the newly discovered phenomenon of radioactivity excited scientists and the general public alike in the s thorium s radioactivity was promoted as a cure for rheumatism diabetes and sexual impotence in most of these uses were banned in the united states after a federal investigation into the health effects of radioactivity individuals in the united states had been injected with thorium during x ray diagnosis they were later found to suffer health issues such as leukaemia and abnormal chromosomes public interest in radioactivity had declined by the end of the s further classification up to the late th century chemists unanimously agreed that thorium and uranium were the heaviest members of group and group respectively the existence of the lanthanides in the sixth row was considered to be a one off fluke in british chemist henry bassett postulated a second extra long periodic table row to accommodate known and undiscovered elements considering thorium and uranium to be analogous to the lanthanides in danish physicist niels bohr published a theoretical model of the atom and its electron orbitals which soon gathered wide acceptance the model indicated that the seventh row of the periodic table should also have f shells filling before the d shells that were filled in the transition elements like the sixth row with the lanthanides preceding the d transition metals the existence of a second inner transition series in the form of the actinides was not accepted until similarities with the electron structures of the lanthanides had been established bohr suggested that the filling of the f orbitals may be delayed to after uranium it was only with the discovery of the first transuranic elements which from plutonium onward have dominant and oxidation states like the lanthanides that it was realised that the actinides were indeed filling f orbitals rather than d orbitals with the transition metal like chemistry of the early actinides being the exception and not the rule in when american physicist glenn t seaborg and his team had discovered the transuranic elements americium and curium he proposed the actinide concept realising that thorium was the second member of an f block actinide series analogous to the lanthanides instead of being the heavier congener of hafnium in a fourth d block row phasing out in the s most applications that do not depend on thorium s radioactivity declined quickly due to safety and environmental concerns as suitable safer replacements were found despite its radioactivity the element has remained in use for applications where no suitable alternatives could be found a study by the oak ridge national laboratory in the united states estimated that using a thorium gas mantle every weekend would be safe for a person but this was not the case for the dose received by people manufacturing the mantles or for the soils around some factory sites some manufacturers have changed to other materials such as yttrium as recently as some companies continued to manufacture and sell thorium mantles without giving adequate information about their radioactivity with some even falsely claiming them to be non radioactive nuclear power thorium has been used as a power source on a prototype scale the earliest thorium based reactor was built at the indian point energy center located in buchanan new york united states in china may be the first to have a shot at commercializing the technology the country with the largest estimated reserves of thorium in the world is india which has sparse reserves of uranium in the s india targeted achieving energy independence with their three stage nuclear power programme in most countries uranium was relatively abundant and the progress of thorium based reactors was slow in the th century three reactors were built in india and twelve elsewhere large scale research was begun in by the international atomic energy agency to study the use of thorium reactors a year later the united states department of energy started their research alvin radkowsky of tel aviv university in israel was the head designer of shippingport atomic power station in pennsylvania the first american civilian reactor to breed thorium he founded a consortium to develop thorium reactors which included other laboratories raytheon nuclear inc and brookhaven national laboratory in the united states and the kurchatov institute in russia in the st century thorium s potential for reducing nuclear proliferation and its waste characteristics led to renewed interest in the thorium fuel cycle india has projected meeting as much as of its electrical demands through thorium based nuclear power by in february bhabha atomic research centre barc in mumbai india presented their latest design for a next generation nuclear reactor that burns thorium as its fuel ore calling it the advanced heavy water reactor ahwr in the chairman of the indian atomic energy commission said that india has a long term objective goal of becoming energy independent based on its vast thorium resources nuclear weapons when gram quantities of plutonium were first produced in the manhattan project it was discovered that a minor isotope pu underwent significant spontaneous fission which brought into question the viability of a plutonium fueled gun type nuclear weapon while the los alamos team began work on the implosion type weapon to circumvent this issue the chicago team discussed reactor design solutions eugene wigner proposed to use the pu contaminated plutonium to drive the conversion of thorium into u in a special converter reactor it was hypothesized that the u would then be usable in a gun type weapon though concerns about contamination from u were voiced progress on the implosion weapon was sufficient and this converter was not developed further but the design had enormous influence on the development of nuclear energy it was the first detailed description of a highly enriched water cooled water moderated reactor similar to future naval and commercial power reactors during the cold war the united states explored the possibility of using th as a source of u to be used in a nuclear bomb they fired a test bomb in they concluded that a u fired bomb would be a very potent weapon but it bore few sustainable technical advantages over the contemporary uranium plutonium bombs especially since u is difficult to produce in isotopically pure form thorium metal was used in the radiation case of at least one nuclear weapon design deployed by the united states the w production the low demand makes working mines for extraction of thorium alone not profitable and it is almost always extracted with the rare earths which themselves may be by products of production of other minerals the current reliance on monazite for production is due to thorium being largely produced as a by product other sources such as thorite contain more thorium and could easily be used for production if demand rose present knowledge of the distribution of thorium resources is poor as low demand has led to exploration efforts being relatively minor in world production of the monazite concentrate from which thorium would be extracted was tonnes the common production route of thorium constitutes concentration of thorium minerals extraction of thorium from the concentrate purification of thorium and optionally conversion to compounds such as thorium dioxide concentration there are two categories of thorium minerals for thorium extraction primary and secondary primary deposits occur in acidic granitic magmas and pegmatites they are concentrated but of small size secondary deposits occur at the mouths of rivers in granitic mountain regions in these deposits thorium is enriched along with other heavy minerals initial concentration varies with the type of deposit for the primary deposits the source pegmatites which are usually obtained by mining are divided into small parts and then undergo flotation alkaline earth metal carbonates may be removed after reaction with hydrogen chloride then follow thickening filtration and calcination the result is a concentrate with rare earth content of up to secondary materials such as coastal sands undergo gravity separation magnetic separation follows with a series of magnets of increasing strength monazite obtained by this method can be as pure as industrial production in the th century relied on treatment with hot concentrated sulfuric acid in cast iron vessels followed by selective precipitation by dilution with water as on the subsequent steps this method relied on the specifics of the technique and the concentrate grain size many alternatives have been proposed but only one has proven effective economically alkaline digestion with hot sodium hydroxide solution this is more expensive than the original method but yields a higher purity of thorium in particular it removes phosphates from the concentrate acid digestion acid digestion is a two stage process involving the use of up to sulfuric acid at c first sulfuric acid in excess of of the sand mass is added thickening the reaction mixture as products are formed then fuming sulfuric acid is added and the mixture is kept at the same temperature for another five hours to reduce the volume of solution remaining after dilution the concentration of the sulfuric acid is selected based on reaction rate and viscosity which both increase with concentration albeit with viscosity retarding the reaction increasing the temperature also speeds up the reaction but temperatures of c and above must be avoided because they cause insoluble thorium pyrophosphate to form since dissolution is very exothermic the monazite sand cannot be added to the acid too quickly conversely at temperatures below c the reaction does not go fast enough for the process to be practical to ensure that no precipitates form to block the reactive monazite surface the mass of acid used must be twice that of the sand instead of the that would be expected from stoichiometry the mixture is then cooled to c and diluted with ten times its volume of cold water so that any remaining monazite sinks to the bottom while the rare earths and thorium remain in solution thorium may then be separated by precipitating it as the phosphate at ph since the rare earths do not precipitate until ph alkaline digestion alkaline digestion is carried out in sodium hydroxide solution at about c for about three hours too high a temperature leads to the formation of poorly soluble thorium oxide and an excess of uranium in the filtrate and too low a concentration of alkali leads to a very slow reaction these reaction conditions are rather mild and require monazite sand with a particle size under m following filtration the filter cake includes thorium and the rare earths as their hydroxides uranium as sodium diuranate and phosphate as trisodium phosphate this crystallises trisodium phosphate decahydrate when cooled below c uranium impurities in this product increase with the amount of silicon dioxide in the reaction mixture necessitating recrystallisation before commercial use the hydroxides are dissolved at c in hydrochloric acid filtration of the remaining precipitates followed by addition of sodium hydroxide results in the precipitation of thorium and uranium at about ph complete drying of the precipitate must be avoided as air may oxidise cerium from the to the oxidation state and the cerium iv formed can liberate free chlorine from the hydrochloric acid the rare earths again precipitate out at higher ph the precipitates are neutralised by the original sodium hydroxide solution although most of the phosphate must first be removed to avoid precipitating rare earth phosphates solvent extraction may also be used to separate out the thorium and uranium by dissolving the resultant filter cake in nitric acid the presence of titanium hydroxide is deleterious as it binds thorium and prevents it from dissolving fully purification high thorium concentrations are needed in nuclear applications in particular concentrations of atoms with high neutron capture cross sections must be very low for example gadolinium concentrations must be lower than one part per million by weight previously repeated dissolution and recrystallisation was used to achieve high purity today liquid solvent extraction procedures involving selective complexation of th are used for example following alkaline digestion and the removal of phosphate the resulting nitrato complexes of thorium uranium and the rare earths can be separated by extraction with tributyl phosphate in kerosene modern applications non radioactivity related uses of thorium have been in decline since the s due to environmental concerns largely stemming from the radioactivity of thorium and its decay products most thorium applications use its dioxide sometimes called thoria in the industry rather than the metal this compound has a melting point of c f the highest of all known oxides only a few substances have higher melting points this helps the compound remain solid in a flame and it considerably increases the brightness of the flame this is the main reason thorium is used in gas lamp mantles all substances emit energy glow at high temperatures but the light emitted by thorium is nearly all in the visible spectrum hence the brightness of thorium mantles energy some of it in the form of visible light is emitted when thorium is exposed to a source of energy itself such as a cathode ray heat or ultraviolet light this effect is shared by cerium dioxide which converts ultraviolet light into visible light more efficiently but thorium dioxide gives a higher flame temperature emitting less infrared light thorium in mantles though still common has been progressively replaced with yttrium since the late s according to the review by the united kingdom s national radiological protection board although thoriated gas mantles were widely available a few years ago they are not any more thorium is also used to make cheap permanent negative ion generators such as in pseudoscientific health bracelets during the production of incandescent filaments recrystallisation of tungsten is significantly lowered by adding small amounts of thorium dioxide to the tungsten sintering powder before drawing the filaments a small addition of thorium to tungsten thermocathodes considerably reduces the work function of electrons as a result electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures thorium forms a one atom thick layer on the surface of tungsten the work function from a thorium surface is lowered possibly because of the electric field on the interface between thorium and tungsten formed due to thorium s greater electropositivity since the s thoriated tungsten wires have been used in electronic tubes and in the cathodes and anticathodes of x ray tubes and rectifiers thanks to the reactivity of thorium with atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen thorium also acts as a getter for impurities in the evacuated tubes the introduction of transistors in the s significantly diminished this use but not entirely thorium dioxide is used in gas tungsten arc welding gtaw to increase the high temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability thorium oxide is being replaced in this use with other oxides such as those of zirconium cerium and lanthanum thorium dioxide is found in heat resistant ceramics such as high temperature laboratory crucibles either as the primary ingredient or as an addition to zirconium dioxide an alloy of platinum and thorium is an effective catalyst for oxidising ammonia to nitrogen oxides but this has been replaced by an alloy of platinum and rhodium because of its better mechanical properties and greater durability when added to glass thorium dioxide helps increase its refractive index and decrease dispersion such glass finds application in high quality lenses for cameras and scientific instruments the radiation from these lenses can darken them and turn them yellow over a period of years and it degrades film but the health risks are minimal yellowed lenses may be restored to their original colourless state by lengthy exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation thorium dioxide has since been replaced in this application by rare earth oxides such as lanthanum as they provide similar effects and are not radioactive thorium tetrafluoride is used as an anti reflection material in multilayered optical coatings it is transparent to electromagnetic waves having wavelengths in the range of m a range that includes near ultraviolet visible and mid infrared light its radiation is primarily due to alpha particles which can be easily stopped by a thin cover layer of another material replacements for thorium tetrafluoride are being developed as of the s which include lanthanum trifluoride mag thor alloys also called thoriated magnesium found use in some aerospace applications though such uses have been phased out due to concerns over radioactivity potential use for nuclear energy the main nuclear power source in a reactor is the neutron induced fission of a nuclide the synthetic fissile nuclei u and pu can be bred from neutron capture by the naturally occurring quantity nuclides th and u u occurs naturally and is also fissile in the thorium fuel cycle the fertile isotope th is bombarded by slow neutrons undergoing neutron capture to become th which undergoes two consecutive beta decays to become first pa and then the fissile u th n th n min pa n days u y u is fissile and can be used as a nuclear fuel in the same way as u or pu when u undergoes nuclear fission the neutrons emitted can strike further th nuclei continuing the cycle this parallels the uranium fuel cycle in fast breeder reactors where u undergoes neutron capture to become u beta decaying to first np and then fissile pu advantages thorium is more abundant than uranium and can satisfy world energy demands for longer it is particularly suitable for being used as fertile material in molten salt reactors th absorbs neutrons more readily than u and u has a higher probability of fission upon neutron capture than u or pu it also releases more neutrons upon fission on average a single neutron capture by u produces transuranic waste along with the fissile pu but th only produces this waste after five captures forming np this number of captures does not happen for of the th nuclei because the intermediate products u or u undergo fission and fewer long lived transuranics are produced because of this thorium is a potentially attractive alternative to uranium in mixed oxide fuels to minimise the generation of transuranics and maximise the destruction of plutonium thorium fuels result in a safer and better performing reactor core because thorium dioxide has a higher melting point higher thermal conductivity and a lower coefficient of thermal expansion it is more stable chemically than the now common fuel uranium dioxide because the latter oxidises to triuranium octoxide u o becoming substantially less dense disadvantages the used fuel is difficult and dangerous to reprocess because many of the daughters of th and u are strong gamma emitters all u production methods result in impurities of u either from parasitic knock out n n reactions on th pa or u that result in the loss of a neutron or from double neutron capture of th an impurity in natural th th n th h pa y pa n pa d u y u by itself is not particularly harmful but quickly decays to produce the strong gamma emitter tl th follows the same decay chain but its much longer half life means that the quantities of tl produced are negligible these impurities of u make u easy to detect and dangerous to work on and the impracticality of their separation limits the possibilities of nuclear proliferation using u as the fissile material pa has a relatively long half life of days and a high cross section for neutron capture thus it is a neutron poison instead of rapidly decaying to the useful u a significant amount of pa converts to u and consumes neutrons degrading the reactor efficiency to avoid this pa is extracted from the active zone of thorium molten salt reactors during their operation so that it does not have a chance to capture a neutron and will only decay to u the irradiation of th with neutrons followed by its processing need to be mastered before these advantages can be realised and this requires more advanced technology than the uranium and plutonium fuel cycle research continues in this area others cite the low commercial viability of the thorium fuel cycle the international nuclear energy agency predicts that the thorium cycle will never be commercially viable while uranium is available in abundance a situation which may persist in the coming decades the isotopes produced in the thorium fuel cycle are mostly not transuranic but some of them are still very dangerous such as pa which has a half life of years and is a major contributor to the long term radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel hazards radiological natural thorium decays very slowly compared to many other radioactive materials and the emitted alpha radiation cannot penetrate human skin as a result handling small amounts of thorium such as those in gas mantles is considered safe although the use of such items may pose some risks exposure to an aerosol of thorium such as contaminated dust can lead to increased risk of cancers of the lung pancreas and blood as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation internal exposure to thorium leads to increased risk of liver diseases the decay products of th include more dangerous radionuclides such as radium and radon although relatively little of those products are created as the result of the slow decay of thorium a proper assessment of the radiological toxicity of th must include the contribution of its daughters some of which are dangerous gamma emitters and which are built up quickly following the initial decay of th due to the absence of long lived nuclides along the decay chain as the dangerous daughters of thorium have much lower melting points than thorium dioxide they are volatilised every time the mantle is heated for use in the first hour of use large fractions of the thorium daughters ra ra pb and bi are released most of the radiation dose by a normal user arises from inhaling the radium resulting in a radiation dose of up to millisieverts per use about a third of the dose sustained during a mammogram some nuclear safety agencies make recommendations about the use of thorium mantles and have raised safety concerns regarding their manufacture and disposal the radiation dose from one mantle is not a serious problem but that from many mantles gathered together in factories or landfills is biological thorium is odourless and tasteless the chemical toxicity of thorium is low because thorium and its most common compounds mostly the dioxide are poorly soluble in water precipitating out before entering the body as the hydroxide some thorium compounds are chemically moderately toxic especially in the presence of strong complex forming ions such as citrate that carry the thorium into the body in soluble form if a thorium containing object has been chewed or sucked it loses of thorium and of its dangerous daughters to the body three quarters of the thorium that has penetrated the body accumulates in the skeleton absorption through the skin is possible but is not a likely means of exposure thorium s low solubility in water also means that excretion of thorium by the kidneys and faeces is rather slow tests on the thorium uptake of workers involved in monazite processing showed thorium levels above recommended limits in their bodies but no adverse effects on health were found at those moderately low concentrations no chemical toxicity has yet been observed in the tracheobronchial tract and the lungs from exposure to thorium people who work with thorium compounds are at a risk of dermatitis it can take as much as thirty years after the ingestion of thorium for symptoms to manifest themselves thorium has no known biological role chemical powdered thorium metal is pyrophoric it ignites spontaneously in air in the united states department of the interior listed thorium as severe on a table entitled ignition and explosibility of metal powders its ignition temperature was given as c f for dust clouds and c f for layers its minimum explosive concentration was listed as oz cu ft kg m the minimum igniting energy for non submicron dust was listed as mj in the sylvania electric products explosion occurred during reprocessing and burning of thorium sludge in new york city united states nine people were injured one died of complications caused by third degree burns exposure routes thorium exists in very small quantities everywhere on earth although larger amounts exist in certain parts the average human contains about micrograms of thorium and typically consumes three micrograms per day most thorium exposure occurs through dust inhalation some thorium comes with food and water but because of its low solubility this exposure is negligible exposure is raised for people who live near thorium deposits or radioactive waste disposal sites those who live near or work in uranium phosphate or tin processing factories and for those who work in gas mantle production thorium is especially common in the tamil nadu coastal areas of india where residents may be exposed to a naturally occurring radiation dose ten times higher than the worldwide average it is also common in northern brazilian coastal areas from south bahia to guarapari a city with radioactive monazite sand beaches with radiation levels up to times higher than world average background radiation another possible source of exposure is thorium dust produced at weapons testing ranges as thorium is used in the guidance systems of some missiles this has been blamed for a high incidence of birth defects and cancer at salto di quirra on the italian island of sardinia ,90
Protactinium,Pa,protactinium formerly protoactinium is a chemical element with the symbol pa and atomic number it is a dense silvery gray actinide metal which readily reacts with oxygen water vapor and inorganic acids it forms various chemical compounds in which protactinium is usually present in the oxidation state but it can also assume and even or states concentrations of protactinium in the earth s crust are typically a few parts per trillion but may reach up to a few parts per million in some uraninite ore deposits because of its scarcity high radioactivity and high toxicity there are currently no uses for protactinium outside scientific research and for this purpose protactinium is mostly extracted from spent nuclear fuel the element was first identified in by kazimierz fajans and oswald helmuth g hring and named brevium because of the short half life of the specific isotope studied i e protactinium a more stable isotope of protactinium pa was discovered in by lise meitner in collaboration with otto hahn and they chose the name protactinium the iupac chose the name protactinium in and confirmed hahn and meitner as discoverers the new name meant nuclear precursor of actinium and reflected that actinium is a product of radioactive decay of protactinium john arnold cranston working with frederick soddy and ada hitchins is also credited with discovering the most stable isotope in but delayed his announcement due to being called up for service in the first world war the longest lived and most abundant nearly naturally occurring isotope of protactinium protactinium has a half life of years and is a decay product of uranium much smaller trace amounts of the short lived protactinium and its nuclear isomer protactinium m occur in the decay chain of uranium protactinium results from the decay of thorium as part of the chain of events used to produce uranium by neutron irradiation of thorium it is an undesired intermediate product in thorium based nuclear reactors and is therefore removed from the active zone of the reactor during the breeding process ocean science utilizes the element to understand the ancient ocean analysis of the relative concentrations of various uranium thorium and protactinium isotopes in water and minerals is used in radiometric dating of sediments which are up to years old and in modeling of various geological processes history in dmitri mendeleev predicted the existence of an element between thorium and uranium the actinide series was unknown at the time therefore uranium was positioned below tungsten in group vi and thorium below zirconium in group iv leaving the space below tantalum in group v empty until the acceptance of the actinide concept in the late s periodic tables were published with this structure for a long time chemists searched for eka tantalum as an element with similar chemical properties to tantalum making a discovery of protactinium nearly impossible tantalum s heavier analogue was later found to be the transuranic element dubnium which however does not react like tantalum but like protactinium in william crookes isolated protactinium as an intensely radioactive material from uranium however he could not characterize it as a new chemical element and thus named it uranium x ux crookes dissolved uranium nitrate in ether and the residual aqueous phase contains most of the th and pa his method was still used in the s to isolate th and pa from uranium compounds protactinium was first identified in when kasimir fajans and oswald helmuth g hring encountered the isotope pa during their studies of the decay chains of uranium u th pa u they named the new element brevium from the latin word brevis meaning brief or short because of its short half life hours for pa in two groups of scientists lise meitner in collaboration with otto hahn of germany and frederick soddy and john cranston of great britain independently discovered another isotope of protactinium pa having a much longer half life of about years thus the name brevium was changed to protactinium as the new element was part of the decay chain of uranium as the parent of actinium from greek pr tos first before the iupac confirmed this naming in the discovery of protactinium completed one of the last gaps in the early versions of the periodic table proposed by mendeleev in and it brought to fame the involved scientists aristid von grosse produced milligrams of pa o in and in first isolated elemental protactinium from milligrams of pa o he used two different procedures in the first one protactinium oxide was irradiated by kev electrons in vacuum in another method called the van arkel de boer process the oxide was chemically converted to a halide chloride bromide or iodide and then reduced in a vacuum with an electrically heated metallic filament pai pa i in the united kingdom atomic energy authority ukaea produced grams of pure protactinium by processing tonnes of waste material in a stage process at a cost of about us for many years this was the world s only significant supply of protactinium which was provided to various laboratories for scientific studies oak ridge national laboratory in the us provided protactinium at a cost of about us gram isotopes thirty radioisotopes of protactinium have been discovered the most stable being pa with a half life of years pa with a half life of days and pa with a half life of days all of the remaining isotopes have half lives shorter than days and the majority of these have half lives less than seconds protactinium also has two nuclear isomers mpa half life milliseconds and mpa half life minutes the primary decay mode for the most stable isotope pa and lighter pa to pa is alpha decay producing isotopes of actinium the primary mode for the heavier isotopes pa to pa is beta decay producing isotopes of uranium occurrence protactinium is one of the rarest and most expensive naturally occurring elements it is found in the form of two isotopes pa and pa with the isotope pa occurring in two different energy states nearly all natural protactinium is protactinium it is an alpha emitter and is formed by the decay of uranium whereas the beta radiating protactinium is produced as a result of uranium decay nearly all uranium decays first to the shorter lived mpa isomer protactinium occurs in uraninite pitchblende at concentrations of about parts pa per million parts ppm of ore whereas the usual content is closer to ppm e g in j chymov czech republic some ores from the democratic republic of the congo have about ppm protactinium is homogeneously dispersed in most natural materials and in water but at much lower concentrations on the order of one part per trillion that corresponds to the radioactivity of picocuries pci g there is about times more protactinium in sandy soil particles than in water even the water present in the same sample of soil much higher ratios of and above are measured in loam soils and clays such as bentonite in nuclear reactors two major protactinium isotopes pa and pa are produced from thorium in nuclear reactors both are undesirable and are usually removed thereby adding complexity to the reactor design and operation in particular th via n n reactions produces th which quickly half life hours decays to pa the last isotope while not a transuranic waste has a long half life of years and is a major contributor to the long term radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel protactinium is formed upon neutron capture by th it further either decays to uranium or captures another neutron and converts into the non fissile uranium pa has a relatively long half life of days and high cross section for neutron capture the so called neutron poison thus instead of rapidly decaying to the useful u a significant fraction of pa converts to non fissile isotopes and consumes neutrons degrading the reactor efficiency to avoid this pa is extracted from the active zone of thorium molten salt reactors during their operation so that it only decays to u this is achieved using several meters tall columns of molten bismuth with lithium dissolved in it in a simplified scenario lithium selectively reduces protactinium salts to protactinium metal which is then extracted from the molten salt cycle and bismuth is merely a carrier it is chosen because of its low melting point c low vapor pressure good solubility for lithium and actinides and immiscibility with molten halides preparation before the advent of nuclear reactors protactinium was separated for scientific experiments from uranium ores nowadays it is mostly produced as an intermediate product of nuclear fission in thorium high temperature reactors the times given are half lives th n th min pa d u displaystyle ce th n th beta ce min pa beta ce d u the isotope can be prepared by radiating thorium with slow neutrons converting it to the beta decaying thorium or by irradiating thorium with fast neutrons generating thorium and neutrons protactinium metal can be prepared by reduction of its fluoride with calcium lithium or barium at a temperature of c physical and chemical properties protactinium is an actinide which is positioned in the periodic table to the left of uranium and to the right of thorium and many of its physical properties are intermediate between those two actinides so protactinium is more dense and rigid than thorium but is lighter than uranium and its melting point is lower than that of thorium and higher than that of uranium the thermal expansion electrical and thermal conductivities of these three elements are comparable and are typical of post transition metals the estimated shear modulus of protactinium is similar to that of titanium protactinium is a metal with silvery gray luster that is preserved for some time in air protactinium easily reacts with oxygen water vapor and acids but not with alkalis at room temperature protactinium crystallizes in the body centered tetragonal structure which can be regarded as distorted body centered cubic lattice this structure does not change upon compression up to gpa the structure changes to face centered cubic fcc upon cooling from high temperature at about c the thermal expansion coefficient of the tetragonal phase between room temperature and c is c protactinium is paramagnetic and no magnetic transitions are known for it at any temperature it becomes superconductive at temperatures below k protactinium tetrachloride is paramagnetic at room temperature but turns ferromagnetic upon cooling to k protactinium exists in two major oxidation states and both in solids and solutions and the and states were observed in some solid phases as the electron configuration of the neutral atom is rn f d s the oxidation state corresponds to the low energy and thus favored f configuration both and states easily form hydroxides in water with the predominant ions being pa oh

temperature of c its crystal structure is cubic and the chemical composition is often non stoichiometric described as pao another phase of this oxide with orthorhombic symmetry has also been reported the black dioxide pao is obtained from the pentoxide by reducing it at c with hydrogen it is not readily soluble in either dilute or concentrated nitric hydrochloric or sulfuric acids but easily dissolves in hydrofluoric acid the dioxide can be converted back to pentoxide by heating in oxygen containing atmosphere to c the monoxide pao has only been observed as a thin coating on protactinium metal but not in an isolated bulk form protactinium forms mixed binary oxides with various metals with alkali metals a the crystals have a chemical formula apao and perovskite structure or a pao and distorted rock salt structure or a pao where oxygen atoms form a hexagonal close packed lattice in all these materials protactinium ions are octahedrally coordinated the pentoxide pa o combines with rare earth metal oxides r o to form various nonstoichiometric mixed oxides also of perovskite structure protactinium oxides are basic they easily convert to hydroxides and can form various salts such as sulfates phosphates nitrates etc the nitrate is usually white but can be brown due to radiolytic decomposition heating the nitrate in air at c converts it to the white protactinium pentoxide the polytrioxophosphate pa po can be produced by reacting difluoride sulfate paf so with phosphoric acid h po under inert gas atmosphere heating the product to about c eliminates the reaction by products such as hydrofluoric acid sulfur trioxide and phosphoric anhydride heating it to higher temperatures in an inert atmosphere decomposes pa po into the diphosphate pap o which is analogous to diphosphates of other actinides in the diphosphate the po groups form pyramids of c v symmetry heating pap o in air to c decomposes it into the pentoxides of phosphorus and protactinium halides protactinium v fluoride forms white crystals where protactinium ions are arranged in pentagonal bipyramids and coordinated by other ions the coordination is the same in protactinium v chloride but the color is yellow the coordination changes to octahedral in the brown protactinium v bromide and is unknown for protactinium v iodide the protactinium coordination in all its tetrahalides is but the arrangement is square antiprismatic in protactinium iv fluoride and dodecahedral in the chloride and bromide brown colored protactinium iii iodide has been reported where protactinium ions are coordinated in a bicapped trigonal prismatic arrangement protactinium v fluoride and protactinium v chloride have a polymeric structure of monoclinic symmetry there within one polymeric chain all the halide atoms lie in one graphite like plane and form planar pentagons around the protactinium ions the coordination of protactinium originates from the halide atoms and two bonds to protactinium atoms belonging to the nearby chains these compounds easily hydrolyze in water the pentachloride melts at c and sublimates at even lower temperatures protactinium v fluoride can be prepared by reacting protactinium oxide with either bromine pentafluoride or bromine trifluoride at about c and protactinium iv fluoride is obtained from the oxide and a mixture of hydrogen and hydrogen fluoride at c a large excess of hydrogen is required to remove atmospheric oxygen leaks into the reaction protactinium v chloride is prepared by reacting protactinium oxide with carbon tetrachloride at temperature of c the by products such as paocl are removed by fractional sublimation reduction of protactinium v chloride with hydrogen at about c yields protactinium iv chloride a yellow green solid which sublimes in vacuum at c it can also be obtained directly from protactinium dioxide by treating it with carbon tetrachloride at c protactinium bromides are produced by the action of aluminium bromide hydrogen bromide carbon tetrabromide or a mixture of hydrogen bromide and thionyl bromide on protactinium oxide an alternative reaction is between protactinium pentachloride and hydrogen bromide or thionyl bromide protactinium v bromide has two similar monoclinic forms one is obtained by sublimation at c and another by sublimation at slightly lower temperature of c protactinium iodides result from the oxides and aluminium iodide or ammonium iodide heated to c protactinium iii iodide was obtained by heating protactinium v iodide in vacuum as with oxides protactinium forms mixed halides with alkali metals among those most remarkable is na paf where protactinium ion is symmetrically surrounded by f ions which form a nearly perfect cube more complex protactinium fluorides are also known such as pa f and ternary fluorides of the types mpaf m li na k rb cs or nh m paf m k rb cs or nh and m paf m li na rb cs all being white crystalline solids the mpaf formula can be represented as a combination of mf and paf these compounds can be obtained by evaporating a hydrofluoric acid solution containing these both complexes for the small alkali cations like na the crystal structure is tetragonal whereas it lowers to orthorphombic for larger cations k rb cs or nh a similar variation was observed for the m paf fluorides namely the crystal symmetry was dependent on the cation and differed for cs paf and m paf m k rb or nh other inorganic compounds oxyhalides and oxysulfides of protactinium are known paobr has a monoclinic structure composed of double chain units where protactinium has coordination and is arranged into pentagonal bipyramids the chains are interconnected through oxygen and bromine atoms and each oxygen atom is related to three protactinium atoms paos is a light yellow non volatile solid with a cubic crystal lattice isostructural to that of other actinide oxysulfides it is obtained by reacting protactinium v chloride with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide at c in hydrides and nitrides protactinium has a low oxidation state of about the hydride is obtained by direct action of hydrogen on the metal at c and the nitride is a product of ammonia and protactinium tetrachloride or pentachloride this bright yellow solid is stable to heating to c in vacuum protactinium carbide pac is formed by reduction of protactinium tetrafluoride with barium in a carbon crucible at a temperature of about c protactinium forms borohydrides which include pa bh it has an unusual polymeric structure with helical chains where the protactinium atom has coordination number of and is surrounded by six bh ions organometallic compounds protactinium iv forms a tetrahedral complex tetrakis cyclopentadienyl protactinium iv or pa c h with four cyclopentadienyl rings which can be synthesized by reacting protactinium iv chloride with molten be c h one ring can be substituted with a halide atom another organometallic complex is golden yellow bis cyclooctatetraene protactinium or protactinocene pa c h which is analogous in structure to uranocene there the metal atom is sandwiched between two cyclooctatetraene ligands similar to uranocene it can be prepared by reacting protactinium tetrachloride with dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide k c h in tetrahydrofuran applications although protactinium is located in the periodic table between uranium and thorium which both have numerous applications there are currently no uses for protactinium outside scientific research owing to its scarcity high radioactivity and high toxicity protactinium arises from the decay of natural uranium and in nuclear reactors by the reaction th n th n and subsequent beta decay it was once thought to be able to support a nuclear chain reaction which could in principle be used to build nuclear weapons the physicist walter seifritz once estimated the associated critical mass as kg however the possibility of criticality of pa has been ruled out since then with the advent of highly sensitive mass spectrometers an application of pa as a tracer in geology and paleoceanography has become possible so the ratio of protactinium to thorium is used for radiometric dating of sediments which are up to years old and in modeling of the formation of minerals in particular its evaluation in oceanic sediments allowed to reconstruct the movements of north atlantic water bodies during the last melting of ice age glaciers some of the protactinium related dating variations rely on the analysis of the relative concentrations for several long living members of the uranium decay chain uranium protactinium and thorium for example these elements have and valence electrons and thus favor and oxidation states respectively and show different physical and chemical properties so thorium and protactinium but not uranium compounds are poorly soluble in aqueous solutions and precipitate into sediments the precipitation rate is faster for thorium than for protactinium besides the concentration analysis for both protactinium half life years and thorium half life years allows to improve the accuracy compared to when only one isotope is measured this double isotope method is also weakly sensitive to inhomogeneities in the spatial distribution of the isotopes and to variations in their precipitation rate precautions protactinium is both toxic and highly radioactive and thus all manipulations with it are performed in a sealed glove box its major isotope pa has a specific activity of curies gbq per gram and primarily emits alpha particles with an energy of mev which can be stopped by a thin layer of any material however it slowly decays with a half life of years into ac which has a specific activity of curies gbq per gram emits both alpha and beta radiation and has a much shorter half life of years ac in turn decays into lighter isotopes with even shorter half lives and much greater specific activities sa as summarized in the table below showing the decay chain of protactinium as protactinium is present in small amounts in most natural products and materials it is ingested with food or water and inhaled with air only about of ingested protactinium is absorbed into the blood and the remainder is excreted from the blood about of the protactinium deposits in the bones about goes to the liver to the kidneys and the rest leaves the body the biological half life of protactinium is about years in the bones whereas in other organs the kinetics has a fast and slow component for example of the protactinium in the liver has a biological half life of days and the remaining for days the corresponding values for kidneys are days and days in all these organs protactinium promotes cancer via its radioactivity the maximum safe dose of pa in the human body is ci kbq which corresponds to micrograms of pa the maximum allowed concentrations of pa in the air in germany is bq m ,91
Uranium,U,uranium is a chemical element with the symbol u and atomic number it is a silvery grey metal in the actinide series of the periodic table a uranium atom has protons and electrons of which are valence electrons uranium is weakly radioactive because all isotopes of uranium are unstable the half lives of its naturally occurring isotopes range between years and billion years the most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium which has neutrons and accounts for over of uranium on earth and uranium which has neutrons uranium has the highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements its density is about higher than that of lead and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten it occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil rock and water and is commercially extracted from uranium bearing minerals such as uraninite in nature uranium is found as uranium uranium and a very small amount of uranium uranium decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle the half life of uranium is about billion years and that of uranium is million years making them useful in dating the age of the earth many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties uranium is the only naturally occurring fissile isotope which makes it widely used in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons however because of the tiny amounts found in nature uranium needs to undergo enrichment so that enough uranium is present uranium is fissionable by fast neutrons and is fertile meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium in a nuclear reactor another fissile isotope uranium can be produced from natural thorium and is studied for future industrial use in nuclear technology uranium has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons uranium and to a lesser degree uranium have a much higher fission cross section for slow neutrons in sufficient concentration these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction this generates the heat in nuclear power reactors and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons depleted uranium u is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating uranium is used as a colorant in uranium glass producing lemon yellow to green colors uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light it was also used for tinting and shading in early photography the discovery of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to martin heinrich klaproth who named the new element after the recently discovered planet uranus eug ne melchior p ligot was the first person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in by henri becquerel research by otto hahn lise meitner enrico fermi and others such as j robert oppenheimer starting in led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in little boy the first nuclear weapon used in war an ensuing arms race during the cold war between the united states and the soviet union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium derived plutonium the security of those weapons is closely monitored since around plutonium obtained by dismantling cold war era bombs is used as fuel for nuclear reactors the development and deployment of these nuclear reactors continue on a global base as they are powerful sources of co free energy characteristics when refined uranium is a silvery white weakly radioactive metal it has a mohs hardness of sufficient to scratch glass and approximately equal to that of titanium rhodium manganese and niobium it is malleable ductile slightly paramagnetic strongly electropositive and a poor electrical conductor uranium metal has a very high density of g cm denser than lead g cm but slightly less dense than tungsten and gold g cm uranium metal reacts with almost all non metal elements with the exception of the noble gases and their compounds with reactivity increasing with temperature hydrochloric and nitric acids dissolve uranium but non oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack the element very slowly when finely divided it can react with cold water in air uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of uranium oxide uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into uranium dioxide or other chemical forms usable in industry uranium was the first isotope that was found to be fissile other naturally occurring isotopes are fissionable but not fissile on bombardment with slow neutrons its uranium isotope will most of the time divide into two smaller nuclei releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons if too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium nuclei a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of heat or in special circumstances an explosion in a nuclear reactor such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison absorbing some of the free neutrons such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor control rods see nuclear reactor physics for a description of this process of reactor control as little as lb kg of uranium can be used to make an atomic bomb the nuclear weapon detonated over hiroshima called little boy relied on uranium fission however the first nuclear bomb the gadget used at trinity and the bomb that was detonated over nagasaki fat man were both plutonium bombs uranium metal has three allotropic forms orthorhombic stable up to c f orthorhombic space group no cmcm lattice parameters a pm b pm c pm tetragonal stable from to c to f tetragonal space group p mnm p nm or p n lattice parameters a pm b c pm body centered cubic from c f to melting point this is the most malleable and ductile state body centered cubic lattice parameter a pm applications military the major application of uranium in the military sector is in high density penetrators this ammunition consists of depleted uranium du alloyed with other elements such as titanium or molybdenum at high impact speed the density hardness and pyrophoricity of the projectile enable the destruction of heavily armored targets tank armor and other removable vehicle armor can also be hardened with depleted uranium plates the use of depleted uranium became politically and environmentally contentious after the use of such munitions by the us uk and other countries during wars in the persian gulf and the balkans raised questions concerning uranium compounds left in the soil see gulf war syndrome depleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials while the metal itself is radioactive its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces as ballast for missile re entry vehicles and as a shielding material due to its high density this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost the main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity uranium being only a weak alpha emitter during the later stages of world war ii the entire cold war and to a lesser extent afterwards uranium has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons initially two major types of fission bombs were built a relatively simple device that uses uranium and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium derived from uranium later a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission fusion bomb thermonuclear weapon was built that uses a plutonium based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion such bombs are jacketed in a non fissile unenriched uranium case and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process civilian the main use of uranium in the civilian sector is to fuel nuclear power plants one kilogram of uranium can theoretically produce about terajoules of energy joules assuming complete fission as much energy as million kilograms tonnes of coal commercial nuclear power plants use fuel that is typically enriched to around uranium the candu and magnox designs are the only commercial reactors capable of using unenriched uranium fuel fuel used for united states navy reactors is typically highly enriched in uranium the exact values are classified in a breeder reactor uranium can also be converted into plutonium through the following reaction u n u np pu before and occasionally after the discovery of radioactivity uranium was primarily used in small amounts for yellow glass and pottery glazes such as uranium glass and in fiestaware the discovery and isolation of radium in uranium ore pitchblende by marie curie sparked the development of uranium mining to extract the radium which was used to make glow in the dark paints for clock and aircraft dials this left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium this waste product was diverted to the glazing industry making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant besides the pottery glazes uranium tile glazes accounted for the bulk of the use including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green yellow mauve black blue red and other colors uranium was also used in photographic chemicals especially uranium nitrate as a toner in lamp filaments for stage lighting bulbs to improve the appearance of dentures and in the leather and wood industries for stains and dyes uranium salts are mordants of silk or wool uranyl acetate and uranyl formate are used as electron dense stains in transmission electron microscopy to increase the contrast of biological specimens in ultrathin sections and in negative staining of viruses isolated cell organelles and macromolecules the discovery of the radioactivity of uranium ushered in additional scientific and practical uses of the element the long half life of the isotope uranium years makes it well suited for use in estimating the age of the earliest igneous rocks and for other types of radiometric dating including uranium thorium dating uranium lead dating and uranium uranium dating uranium metal is used for x ray targets in the making of high energy x rays history pre discovery use the use of uranium in its natural oxide form dates back to at least the year ce when it was used in the roman empire to add a yellow color to ceramic glazes yellow glass with uranium oxide was found in a roman villa on cape posillipo in the bay of naples italy by r t gunther of the university of oxford in starting in the late middle ages pitchblende was extracted from the habsburg silver mines in joachimsthal bohemia now j chymov in the czech republic and was used as a coloring agent in the local glassmaking industry in the early th century the world s only known sources of uranium ore were these mines mining for uranium in the ore mountains ceased on the german side after the cold war ended and sdag wismut was wound down on the czech side there were attempts during the uranium price bubble of to restart mining but those were quickly abandoned following a fall in uranium prices discovery the discovery of the element is credited to the german chemist martin heinrich klaproth while he was working in his experimental laboratory in berlin in klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound likely sodium diuranate by dissolving pitchblende in nitric acid and neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide klaproth assumed the yellow substance was the oxide of a yet undiscovered element and heated it with charcoal to obtain a black powder which he thought was the newly discovered metal itself in fact that powder was an oxide of uranium he named the newly discovered element after the planet uranus named after the primordial greek god of the sky which had been discovered eight years earlier by william herschel in eug ne melchior p ligot professor of analytical chemistry at the conservatoire national des arts et m tiers central school of arts and manufactures in paris isolated the first sample of uranium metal by heating uranium tetrachloride with potassium henri becquerel discovered radioactivity by using uranium in becquerel made the discovery in paris by leaving a sample of a uranium salt k uo so potassium uranyl sulfate on top of an unexposed photographic plate in a drawer and noting that the plate had become fogged he determined that a form of invisible light or rays emitted by uranium had exposed the plate during world war i when the central powers suffered a shortage of molybdenum to make artillery gun barrels and high speed tool steels they routinely substituted ferrouranium alloys which present many of the same physical characteristics when this practice became known in the usa government requested several prominent universities to research these uses for uranium and tools made with these formulas remained in use for several decades only ending when the manhattan project and the cold war placed a large demand on uranium for fission research and weapon development fission research a team led by enrico fermi in observed that bombarding uranium with neutrons produces the emission of beta rays electrons or positrons from the elements produced see beta particle the fission products were at first mistaken for new elements with atomic numbers and which the dean of the faculty of rome orso mario corbino christened ausonium and hesperium respectively the experiments leading to the discovery of uranium s ability to fission break apart into lighter elements and release binding energy were conducted by otto hahn and fritz strassmann in hahn s laboratory in berlin lise meitner and her nephew the physicist otto robert frisch published the physical explanation in february and named the process nuclear fission soon after fermi hypothesized that the fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain a fission reaction confirmation of this hypothesis came in and later work found that on average about neutrons are released by each fission of the rare uranium isotope uranium fermi urged alfred o c nier to separate uranium isotopes for determination of the fissile component and on february nier used an instrument he built at the university of minnesota to separate the world s first uranium sample in the tate laboratory after mailed to columbia university s cyclotron john dunning confirmed the sample to be the isolated fissile material on march further work found that the far more common uranium isotope can be transmuted into plutonium which like uranium is also fissile by thermal neutrons these discoveries led numerous countries to begin working on the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear power despite fission having been discovered in germany the uranverein uranium club germany s wartime project to research nuclear power and or weapons was hampered by limited resources infighting the exile or non involvement of several prominent scientists in the field and several crucial mistakes such as failing to account for impurities in available graphite samples which made it appear less suitable as a neutron moderator than it is in reality germany s attempts to build a natural uranium heavy water reactor had not come close to reaching criticality by the time the americans reached haigerloch the site of the last german wartime reactor experiment on december as part of the manhattan project another team led by enrico fermi was able to initiate the first artificial self sustained nuclear chain reaction chicago pile an initial plan using enriched uranium was abandoned as it was as yet unavailable in sufficient quantities working in a lab below the stands of stagg field at the university of chicago the team created the conditions needed for such a reaction by piling together short tons metric tons of graphite short tons metric tons of uranium oxide and six short tons metric tons of uranium metal a majority of which was supplied by westinghouse lamp plant in a makeshift production process nuclear weaponry two major types of atomic bombs were developed by the united states during world war ii a uranium based device codenamed little boy whose fissile material was highly enriched uranium and a plutonium based device see trinity test and fat man whose plutonium was derived from uranium the uranium based little boy device became the first nuclear weapon used in war when it was detonated over the japanese city of hiroshima on august exploding with a yield equivalent to tonnes of tnt the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly buildings and killed approximately people see atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki initially it was believed that uranium was relatively rare and that nuclear proliferation could be avoided by simply buying up all known uranium stocks but within a decade large deposits of it were discovered in many places around the world reactors the x graphite reactor at oak ridge national laboratory ornl in oak ridge tennessee formerly known as the clinton pile and x pile was the world s second artificial nuclear reactor after enrico fermi s chicago pile and was the first reactor designed and built for continuous operation argonne national laboratory s experimental breeder reactor i located at the atomic energy commission s national reactor testing station near arco idaho became the first nuclear reactor to create electricity on december initially four watt light bulbs were lit by the reactor but improvements eventually enabled it to power the whole facility later the town of arco became the first in the world to have all its electricity come from nuclear power generated by borax iii another reactor designed and operated by argonne national laboratory the world s first commercial scale nuclear power station obninsk in the soviet union began generation with its reactor am on june other early nuclear power plants were calder hall in england which began generation on october and the shippingport atomic power station in pennsylvania which began on may nuclear power was used for the first time for propulsion by a submarine the uss nautilus in prehistoric naturally occurring fission in the french physicist francis perrin discovered fifteen ancient and no longer active natural nuclear fission reactors in three separate ore deposits at the oklo mine in gabon west africa collectively known as the oklo fossil reactors the ore deposit is billion years old then uranium constituted about of the total uranium on earth this is high enough to permit a sustained nuclear fission chain reaction to occur provided other supporting conditions exist the capacity of the surrounding sediment to contain the nuclear waste products has been cited by the u s federal government as supporting evidence for the feasibility to store spent nuclear fuel at the yucca mountain nuclear waste repository contamination and the cold war legacy above ground nuclear tests by the soviet union and the united states in the s and early s and by france into the s and s spread a significant amount of fallout from uranium daughter isotopes around the world additional fallout and pollution occurred from several nuclear accidents uranium miners have a higher incidence of cancer an excess risk of lung cancer among navajo uranium miners for example has been documented and linked to their occupation the radiation exposure compensation act a law in the us required in compassion payments to uranium miners diagnosed with cancer or other respiratory ailments during the cold war between the soviet union and the united states huge stockpiles of uranium were amassed and tens of thousands of nuclear weapons were created using enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium since the break up of the soviet union in an estimated short tons metric tons of highly enriched weapons grade uranium enough to make nuclear warheads have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the russian federation and several other former soviet states police in asia europe and south america on at least occasions from to have intercepted shipments of smuggled bomb grade uranium or plutonium most of which was from ex soviet sources from to the material protection control and accounting program operated by the federal government of the united states spent approximately us million to help safeguard uranium and plutonium stockpiles in russia this money was used for improvements and security enhancements at research and storage facilities scientific american reported in february that in some of the facilities security consisted of chain link fences which were in severe states of disrepair according to an interview from the article one facility had been storing samples of enriched weapons grade uranium in a broom closet before the improvement project another had been keeping track of its stock of nuclear warheads using index cards kept in a shoe box occurrence origin along with all elements having atomic weights higher than that of iron uranium is only naturally formed by the r process rapid neutron capture in supernovae and neutron star mergers primordial thorium and uranium are only produced in the r process because the s process slow neutron capture is too slow and cannot pass the gap of instability after bismuth besides the two extant primordial uranium isotopes u and u the r process also produced significant quantities of u which has a shorter half life and so is an extinct radionuclide having long since decayed completely to th uranium was itself enriched by the decay of pu accounting for the observed higher than expected abundance of thorium and lower than expected abundance of uranium while the natural abundance of uranium has been supplemented by the decay of extinct pu half life million years and cm half life million years producing u and u respectively this occurred to an almost negligible extent due to the shorter half lives of these parents and their lower production than u and pu the parents of thorium the cm u ratio at the formation of the solar system was biotic and abiotic uranium is a naturally occurring element that can be found in low levels within all rock soil and water uranium is the st element in order of abundance in the earth s crust uranium is also the highest numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on earth and is almost always found combined with other elements the decay of uranium thorium and potassium in the earth s mantle is thought to be the main source of heat that keeps the earth s outer core in the liquid state and drives mantle convection which in turn drives plate tectonics uranium s average concentration in the earth s crust is depending on the reference to parts per million or about times as abundant as silver the earth s crust from the surface to km mi down is calculated to contain kg lb of uranium while the oceans may contain kg lb the concentration of uranium in soil ranges from to parts per million up to parts per million in farmland soil due to use of phosphate fertilizers and its concentration in sea water is parts per billion uranium is more plentiful than antimony tin cadmium mercury or silver and it is about as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum uranium is found in hundreds of minerals including uraninite the most common uranium ore carnotite autunite uranophane torbernite and coffinite significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits and minerals such as lignite and monazite sands in uranium rich ores it is recovered commercially from sources with as little as uranium some bacteria such as shewanella putrefaciens geobacter metallireducens and some strains of burkholderia fungorum use uranium for their growth and convert u vi to u iv recent research suggests that this pathway includes reduction of the soluble u vi via an intermediate u v pentavalent state other organisms such as the lichen trapelia involuta or microorganisms such as the bacterium citrobacter can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to times the level of their environment citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate or other similar organic phosphates after one day one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uranium polluted water the proteobacterium geobacter has also been shown to bioremediate uranium in ground water the mycorrhizal fungus glomus intraradices increases uranium content in the roots of its symbiotic plant in nature uranium vi forms highly soluble carbonate complexes at alkaline ph this leads to an increase in mobility and availability of uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards however it is difficult to precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at alkaline ph a sphingomonas sp strain bsar has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase phok that has been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions the precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing phok protein in e coli plants absorb some uranium from soil dry weight concentrations of uranium in plants range from to parts per billion and ash from burnt wood can have concentrations up to parts per million dry weight concentrations of uranium in food plants are typically lower with one to two micrograms per day ingested through the food people eat production and mining worldwide production of u o yellowcake in amounted to tonnes of which t was mined in kazakhstan other important uranium mining countries are canada t australia t niger t namibia t and russia t uranium ore is mined in several ways by open pit underground in situ leaching and borehole mining see uranium mining low grade uranium ore mined typically contains to uranium oxides extensive measures must be employed to extract the metal from its ore high grade ores found in athabasca basin deposits in saskatchewan canada can contain up to uranium oxides on average uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali the leachate is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation solvent extraction and ion exchange the resulting mixture called yellowcake contains at least uranium oxides u o yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process before refining and conversion commercial grade uranium can be produced through the reduction of uranium halides with alkali or alkaline earth metals uranium metal can also be prepared through electrolysis of kuf or uf dissolved in molten calcium chloride cacl and sodium chloride nacl solution very pure uranium is produced through the thermal decomposition of uranium halides on a hot filament resources and reserves it is estimated that million tonnes of uranium exists in ore reserves that are economically viable at us per lb of uranium while million tonnes are classed as mineral resources reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction prices went from about lb in may to lb in july this has caused a big increase in spending on exploration with us million being spent worldwide in a increase on the previous year this trend continued through when expenditure on exploration rocketed to over million an increase of over compared to the oecd nuclear energy agency said exploration figures for would likely match those for australia has of the world s known uranium ore reserves and the world s largest single uranium deposit located at the olympic dam mine in south australia there is a significant reserve of uranium in bakouma a sub prefecture in the prefecture of mbomou in the central african republic some nuclear fuel comes from nuclear weapons being dismantled such as from the megatons to megawatts program an additional billion tonnes of uranium are estimated to be dissolved in sea water japanese scientists in the s showed that extraction of uranium from sea water using ion exchangers was technically feasible there have been experiments to extract uranium from sea water but the yield has been low due to the carbonate present in the water in ornl researchers announced the successful development of a new absorbent material dubbed hicap which performs surface retention of solid or gas molecules atoms or ions and also effectively removes toxic metals from water according to results verified by researchers at pacific northwest national laboratory supplies in seventeen countries produced concentrated uranium oxides canada of world production australia kazakhstan russia namibia niger uzbekistan the united states argentina ukraine and china in kazakhstan was forecast to increase production and may have become the world s largest producer of uranium by with an expected production of tonnes compared to canada with t and australia with t the predictions have come true in kazakhstan produces the largest share of uranium from mines of world supply followed by canada and australia namibia uzbekistan niger russia china ukraine usa india iran with total world production tonnes from mines however it should be mentioned that in uranium was mined not only by conventional underground mining of ores of production tonnes where rock mineralised is removed from the ground breaking it up and treating it to remove the minerals being sought but also by in situ leaching methods isl of world production tonnes in the late s un geologists also discovered major uranium deposits and other rare mineral reserves in somalia the find was the largest of its kind with industry experts estimating the deposits at over of the world s then known uranium reserves of tons the ultimate available supply is believed to be sufficient for at least the next years although some studies indicate underinvestment in the late twentieth century may produce supply problems in the st century uranium deposits seem to be log normal distributed there is a fold increase in the amount of uranium recoverable for each tenfold decrease in ore grade in other words there is little high grade ore and proportionately much more low grade ore available compounds oxidation states and oxides oxides calcined uranium yellowcake as produced in many large mills contains a distribution of uranium oxidation species in various forms ranging from most oxidized to least oxidized particles with short residence times in a calciner will generally be less oxidized than those with long retention times or particles recovered in the stack scrubber uranium content is usually referenced to u o which dates to the days of the manhattan project when u o was used as an analytical chemistry reporting standard phase relationships in the uranium oxygen system are complex the most important oxidation states of uranium are uranium iv and uranium vi and their two corresponding oxides are respectively uranium dioxide uo and uranium trioxide uo other uranium oxides such as uranium monoxide uo diuranium pentoxide u o and uranium peroxide uo h o also exist the most common forms of uranium oxide are triuranium octoxide u o and uo both oxide forms are solids that have low solubility in water and are relatively stable over a wide range of environmental conditions triuranium octoxide is depending on conditions the most stable

convert to u o because of their stability uranium oxides are generally considered the preferred chemical form for storage or disposal aqueous chemistry salts of many oxidation states of uranium are water soluble and may be studied in aqueous solutions the most common ionic forms are u brown red u green uo unstable and uo yellow for u iii u iv u v and u vi respectively a few solid and semi metallic compounds such as uo and us exist for the formal oxidation state uranium ii but no simple ions are known to exist in solution for that state ions of u liberate hydrogen from water and are therefore considered to be highly unstable the uo ion represents the uranium vi state and is known to form compounds such as uranyl carbonate uranyl chloride and uranyl sulfate uo also forms complexes with various organic chelating agents the most commonly encountered of which is uranyl acetate unlike the uranyl salts of uranium and polyatomic ion uranium oxide cationic forms the uranates salts containing a polyatomic uranium oxide anion are generally not water soluble carbonates the interactions of carbonate anions with uranium vi cause the pourbaix diagram to change greatly when the medium is changed from water to a carbonate containing solution while the vast majority of carbonates are insoluble in water students are often taught that all carbonates other than those of alkali metals are insoluble in water uranium carbonates are often soluble in water this is because a u vi cation is able to bind two terminal oxides and three or more carbonates to form anionic complexes effects of ph the uranium fraction diagrams in the presence of carbonate illustrate this further when the ph of a uranium vi solution increases the uranium is converted to a hydrated uranium oxide hydroxide and at high phs it becomes an anionic hydroxide complex when carbonate is added uranium is converted to a series of carbonate complexes if the ph is increased one effect of these reactions is increased solubility of uranium in the ph range to a fact that has a direct bearing on the long term stability of spent uranium dioxide nuclear fuels hydrides carbides and nitrides uranium metal heated to to c to f reacts with hydrogen to form uranium hydride even higher temperatures will reversibly remove the hydrogen this property makes uranium hydrides convenient starting materials to create reactive uranium powder along with various uranium carbide nitride and halide compounds two crystal modifications of uranium hydride exist an form that is obtained at low temperatures and a form that is created when the formation temperature is above c uranium carbides and uranium nitrides are both relatively inert semimetallic compounds that are minimally soluble in acids react with water and can ignite in air to form u o carbides of uranium include uranium monocarbide uc uranium dicarbide uc and diuranium tricarbide u c both uc and uc are formed by adding carbon to molten uranium or by exposing the metal to carbon monoxide at high temperatures stable below c u c is prepared by subjecting a heated mixture of uc and uc to mechanical stress uranium nitrides obtained by direct exposure of the metal to nitrogen include uranium mononitride un uranium dinitride un and diuranium trinitride u n halides all uranium fluorides are created using uranium tetrafluoride uf uf itself is prepared by hydrofluorination of uranium dioxide reduction of uf with hydrogen at c produces uranium trifluoride uf under the right conditions of temperature and pressure the reaction of solid uf with gaseous uranium hexafluoride uf can form the intermediate fluorides of u f u f and uf at room temperatures uf has a high vapor pressure making it useful in the gaseous diffusion process to separate the rare uranium from the common uranium isotope this compound can be prepared from uranium dioxide and uranium hydride by the following process uo hf uf h o c endothermic uf f uf c endothermic the resulting uf a white solid is highly reactive by fluorination easily sublimes emitting a vapor that behaves as a nearly ideal gas and is the most volatile compound of uranium known to exist one method of preparing uranium tetrachloride ucl is to directly combine chlorine with either uranium metal or uranium hydride the reduction of ucl by hydrogen produces uranium trichloride ucl while the higher chlorides of uranium are prepared by reaction with additional chlorine all uranium chlorides react with water and air bromides and iodides of uranium are formed by direct reaction of respectively bromine and iodine with uranium or by adding uh to those element s acids known examples include ubr ubr ui and ui ui has never been prepared uranium oxyhalides are water soluble and include uo f uocl uo cl and uo br stability of the oxyhalides decrease as the atomic weight of the component halide increases isotopes natural concentrations natural uranium consists of three major isotopes uranium natural abundance uranium and uranium all three are radioactive emitting alpha particles with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission there are also four other trace isotopes uranium which is formed when u undergoes spontaneous fission releasing neutrons that are captured by another u atom uranium which is formed when u captures a neutron but emits two more which then decays to neptunium uranium which occurs in trace quantities due to neutron capture on u and as a decay product of plutonium and finally uranium which is formed in the decay chain of neptunium it is also expected that thorium should be able to undergo double beta decay which would produce uranium but this has not yet been observed experimentally the only significant deviation from the u to u ratio in any known natural samples occurs in oklo gabon where natural nuclear fission reactors consumed some of the u some two billion years ago when the ratio of u to u was more akin to that of low enriched uranium allowing regular light water to act as a neutron moderator akin to the process in humanmade light water reactors the existence of such natural fission reactors which had been theoretically predicted beforehand was proven as the slight deviation of u concentration from the expected values were discovered during uranium enrichment in france subsequent investigations to rule out any nefarious human action such as stealing of u confirmed the theory by finding isotope ratios of common fission products or rather their stable daughter nuclides in line with the values expected for fission but deviating from the values expected for non fission derived samples of those elements uranium is the most stable isotope of uranium with a half life of about years roughly the age of the earth uranium has a half life of about years and uranium has a half life of about years uranium is usually an alpha emitter occasionally it undergoes spontaneous fission decaying through the uranium series which has members into lead by a variety of different decay paths the decay chain of u which is called the actinium series has members and eventually decays into lead the constant rates of decay in these decay series makes the comparison of the ratios of parent to daughter elements useful in radiometric dating uranium which is a member of the uranium series the decay chain of uranium decays to lead through a series of relatively short lived isotopes uranium is made from thorium by neutron bombardment usually in a nuclear reactor and u is also fissile its decay chain forms part of the neptunium series and ends at bismuth and thallium uranium is important for both nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons because it is the only uranium isotope existing in nature on earth in any significant amount that is fissile this means that it can be split into two or three fragments fission products by thermal neutrons uranium is not fissile but is a fertile isotope because after neutron activation it can be converted to plutonium another fissile isotope indeed the u nucleus can absorb one neutron to produce the radioactive isotope uranium u decays by beta emission to neptunium also a beta emitter that decays in its turn within a few days into plutonium pu was used as fissile material in the first atomic bomb detonated in the trinity test on july in new mexico enrichment in nature uranium is found as uranium and uranium isotope separation concentrates enriches the fissionable uranium for nuclear weapons and most nuclear power plants except for gas cooled reactors and pressurised heavy water reactors most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium must impact other uranium atoms to sustain the nuclear chain reaction the concentration and amount of uranium needed to achieve this is called a critical mass to be considered enriched the uranium fraction should be between and this process produces huge quantities of uranium that is depleted of uranium and with a correspondingly increased fraction of uranium called depleted uranium or du to be considered depleted the uranium isotope concentration should be no more than the price of uranium has risen since so enrichment tailings containing more than uranium are being considered for re enrichment driving the price of depleted uranium hexafluoride above per kilogram in july from in the gas centrifuge process where gaseous uranium hexafluoride uf is separated by the difference in molecular weight between uf and uf using high speed centrifuges is the cheapest and leading enrichment process the gaseous diffusion process had been the leading method for enrichment and was used in the manhattan project in this process uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly diffused through a silver zinc membrane and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate since uranium is heavier it diffuses slightly slower than uranium the molecular laser isotope separation method employs a laser beam of precise energy to sever the bond between uranium and fluorine this leaves uranium bonded to fluorine and allows uranium metal to precipitate from the solution an alternative laser method of enrichment is known as atomic vapor laser isotope separation avlis and employs visible tunable lasers such as dye lasers another method used is liquid thermal diffusion human exposure a person can be exposed to uranium or its radioactive daughters such as radon by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food the amount of uranium in air is usually very small however people who work in factories that process phosphate fertilizers live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium weapons have been used or live or work near a coal fired power plant facilities that mine or process uranium ore or enrich uranium for reactor fuel may have increased exposure to uranium houses or structures that are over uranium deposits either natural or man made slag deposits may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas the occupational safety and health administration osha has set the permissible exposure limit for uranium exposure in the workplace as mg m over an hour workday the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit rel of mg m over an hour workday and a short term limit of mg m at levels of mg m uranium is immediately dangerous to life and health most ingested uranium is excreted during digestion only is absorbed when insoluble forms of uranium such as its oxide are ingested whereas absorption of the more soluble uranyl ion can be up to however soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through the body whereas insoluble uranium compounds especially when inhaled by way of dust into the lungs pose a more serious exposure hazard after entering the bloodstream the absorbed uranium tends to bioaccumulate and stay for many years in bone tissue because of uranium s affinity for phosphates uranium is not absorbed through the skin and alpha particles released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin incorporated uranium becomes uranyl ions which accumulate in bone liver kidney and reproductive tissues uranium can be decontaminated from steel surfaces and aquifers effects and precautions normal functioning of the kidney brain liver heart and other systems can be affected by uranium exposure because besides being weakly radioactive uranium is a toxic metal uranium is also a reproductive toxicant radiological effects are generally local because alpha radiation the primary form of u decay has a very short range and will not penetrate skin alpha radiation from inhaled uranium has been demonstrated to cause lung cancer in exposed nuclear workers uranyl uo ions such as from uranium trioxide or uranyl nitrate and other hexavalent uranium compounds have been shown to cause birth defects and immune system damage in laboratory animals while the cdc has published one study that no human cancer has been seen as a result of exposure to natural or depleted uranium exposure to uranium and its decay products especially radon are widely known and significant health threats exposure to strontium iodine and other fission products is unrelated to uranium exposure but may result from medical procedures or exposure to spent reactor fuel or fallout from nuclear weapons although accidental inhalation exposure to a high concentration of uranium hexafluoride has resulted in human fatalities those deaths were associated with the generation of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid and uranyl fluoride rather than with uranium itself finely divided uranium metal presents a fire hazard because uranium is pyrophoric small grains will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature uranium metal is commonly handled with gloves as a sufficient precaution uranium concentrate is handled and contained so as to ensure that people do not inhale or ingest it ,92
Neptunium,Np,neptunium is a chemical element with the symbol np and atomic number a radioactive actinide metal neptunium is the first transuranic element its position in the periodic table just after uranium named after the planet uranus led to it being named after neptune the next planet beyond uranus a neptunium atom has protons and electrons of which seven are valence electrons neptunium metal is silvery and tarnishes when exposed to air the element occurs in three allotropic forms and it normally exhibits five oxidation states ranging from to it is radioactive poisonous pyrophoric and capable of accumulating in bones which makes the handling of neptunium dangerous although many false claims of its discovery were made over the years the element was first synthesized by edwin mcmillan and philip h abelson at the berkeley radiation laboratory in since then most neptunium has been and still is produced by neutron irradiation of uranium in nuclear reactors the vast majority is generated as a by product in conventional nuclear power reactors while neptunium itself has no commercial uses at present it is used as a precursor for the formation of plutonium and in radioisotope thermal generators to provide electricity for spacecraft neptunium has also been used in detectors of high energy neutrons the longest lived isotope of neptunium neptunium is a by product of nuclear reactors and plutonium production it and the isotope neptunium are also found in trace amounts in uranium ores due to neutron capture reactions and beta decay characteristics physical neptunium is a hard silvery ductile radioactive actinide metal in the periodic table it is located to the right of the actinide uranium to the left of the actinide plutonium and below the lanthanide promethium neptunium is a hard metal having a bulk modulus of gpa comparable to that of manganese neptunium metal is similar to uranium in terms of physical workability when exposed to air at normal temperatures it forms a thin oxide layer this reaction proceeds more rapidly as the temperature increases neptunium melts at c this low melting point a property the metal shares with the neighboring element plutonium which has melting point c is due to the hybridization of the f and d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in the metal the boiling point of neptunium is not empirically known and the usually given value of c is extrapolated from the vapor pressure of the element if accurate this would give neptunium the largest liquid range of any element k passes between its melting and boiling points neptunium is found in at least three allotropes some claims of a fourth allotrope have been made but they are so far not proven this multiplicity of allotropes is common among the actinides the crystal structures of neptunium protactinium uranium and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more similar to those of the d transition metals neptunium takes on an orthorhombic structure resembling a highly distorted body centered cubic structure each neptunium atom is coordinated to four others and the np np bond lengths are pm it is the densest of all the actinides and the fifth densest of all naturally occurring elements behind only rhenium platinum iridium and osmium neptunium has semimetallic properties such as strong covalent bonding and a high electrical resistivity and its metallic physical properties are closer to those of the metalloids than the true metals some allotropes of the other actinides also exhibit similar behaviour though to a lesser degree the densities of different isotopes of neptunium in the alpha phase are expected to be observably different np should have density g cm np density g cm np density g cm neptunium takes on a distorted tetragonal close packed structure four atoms of neptunium make up a unit cell and the np np bond lengths are pm neptunium has a body centered cubic structure and has np np bond length of pm the form becomes less stable with increased pressure though the melting point of neptunium also increases with pressure the np np liquid triple point occurs at c and mpa alloys due to the presence of valence f electrons neptunium and its alloys exhibit very interesting magnetic behavior like many other actinides these can range from the itinerant band like character characteristic of the transition metals to the local moment behavior typical of scandium yttrium and the lanthanides this stems from f orbital hybridization with the orbitals of the metal ligands and the fact that the f orbital is relativistically destabilized and extends outwards for example pure neptunium is paramagnetic npal is ferromagnetic npge has no magnetic ordering and npsn behaves fermionically investigations are underway regarding alloys of neptunium with uranium americium plutonium zirconium and iron so as to recycle long lived waste isotopes such as neptunium into shorter lived isotopes more useful as nuclear fuel one neptunium based superconductor alloy has been discovered with formula nppd al this occurrence in neptunium compounds is somewhat surprising because they often exhibit strong magnetism which usually destroys superconductivity the alloy has a tetragonal structure with a superconductivity transition temperature of c k chemical neptunium has five ionic oxidation states ranging from to when forming chemical compounds which can be simultaneously observed in solutions it is the heaviest actinide that can lose all its valence electrons in a stable compound the most stable state in solution is but the valence is preferred in solid neptunium compounds neptunium metal is very reactive ions of neptunium are prone to hydrolysis and formation of coordination compounds atomic a neptunium atom has electrons arranged in the configuration rn f d s this differs from the configuration expected by the aufbau principle in that one electron is in the d subshell instead of being as expected in the f subshell this is because of the similarity of the electron energies of the f d and s subshells in forming compounds and ions all the valence electrons may be lost leaving behind an inert core of inner electrons with the electron configuration of the noble gas radon more commonly only some of the valence electrons will be lost the electron configuration for the tripositive ion np is rn f with the outermost s and d electrons lost first this is exactly analogous to neptunium s lanthanide homolog promethium and conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their rn fn electron configurations in the tripositive state the first ionization potential of neptunium was measured to be at most ev in based on the assumption that the s electrons would ionize before f and d more recent measurements have refined this to ev isotopes neptunium radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being np with a half life of million years np with a half life of years and np with a half life of days all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are less than days and the majority of these have half lives that are less than minutes this element also has at least four meta states with the most stable being mnp with a half life of hours the isotopes of neptunium range in atomic weight from u np to u np though np and np have not yet been reported most of the isotopes that are lighter than the most stable one np decay primarily by electron capture although a sizable number most notably np and np also exhibit various levels of decay via alpha emission to become protactinium np itself being the beta stable isobar of mass number decays almost exclusively by alpha emission into pa with very rare occurring only about once in trillions of decays spontaneous fission and cluster decay emission of mg to form tl all of the known isotopes except one that are heavier than this decay exclusively via beta emission the lone exception mnp exhibits a rare decay by isomeric transition in addition to beta emission np eventually decays to form bismuth and thallium unlike most other common heavy nuclei which decay into isotopes of lead this decay chain is known as the neptunium series this decay chain had long been extinct on earth due to the short half lives of all of its isotopes above bismuth but is now being resurrected thanks to artificial production of neptunium on the tonne scale the isotopes neptunium and are predicted to be fissile only neptunium s fissionability has been experimentally shown with the critical mass being about kg only about kg more than that of the commonly used uranium calculated values of the critical masses of neptunium and respectively are kg kg and kg the neptunium value is even lower than that of plutonium in particular np also has a low neutron cross section despite this a neptunium atomic bomb has never been built uranium and plutonium have lower critical masses than np and np and np is difficult to purify as it is not found in quantity in spent nuclear fuel and is nearly impossible to separate in any significant quantities from its parent np occurrence since all isotopes of neptunium have half lives that are many times shorter than the age of the earth any primordial neptunium should have decayed by now after only about million years the concentration of even the longest lived isotope np would have been reduced to less than one trillionth of its original amount thus neptunium is present in nature only in negligible amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes trace amounts of the neptunium isotopes neptunium and are found naturally as decay products from transmutation reactions in uranium ores in particular np and np are the most common of these isotopes they are directly formed from neutron capture by uranium atoms these neutrons come from the spontaneous fission of uranium naturally neutron induced fission of uranium cosmic ray spallation of nuclei and light elements absorbing alpha particles and emitting a neutron the half life of np is very short although the detection of its much longer lived daughter pu in nature in definitively established its natural occurrence in np was identified and isolated from concentrates of uranium ore from the belgian congo in these minerals the ratio of neptunium to uranium is less than or equal to about to most neptunium and plutonium now encountered in the environment is due to atmospheric nuclear explosions that took place between the detonation of the first atomic bomb in and the ratification of the partial nuclear test ban treaty in the total amount of neptunium released by these explosions and the few atmospheric tests that have been carried out since is estimated to be around kg the overwhelming majority of this is composed of the long lived isotopes np and np since even the moderately long lived np half life days would have decayed to less than one billionth its original concentration over the intervening decades an additional very small amount of neptunium created by neutron irradiation of natural uranium in nuclear reactor cooling water is released when the water is discharged into rivers or lakes the concentration of np in seawater is approximately millibecquerels per liter this concentration is between and that of plutonium once in the environment neptunium generally oxidizes fairly quickly usually to the or state regardless of its oxidation state the element exhibits much greater mobility than the other actinides largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements in one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium v plutonium iv and americium iii in sandstone and limestone neptunium penetrated more than ten times as well as the other elements np v will also react efficiently in ph levels greater than if there are no carbonates present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with quartz it has also been observed to bond well with goethite ferric oxide colloids and several clays including kaolinite and smectite np v does not bond as readily to soil particles in mildly acidic conditions as its fellow actinides americium and curium by nearly an order of magnitude this behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place contributing further to its mobility np v is also readily absorbed by concrete which because of the element s radioactivity is a consideration that must be addressed when building nuclear waste storage facilities when absorbed in concrete it is reduced to np iv in a relatively short period of time np v is also reduced by humic acid if it is present on the surface of goethite hematite and magnetite np iv is absorbed efficiently by tuff granodiorite and bentonite although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly acidic conditions it also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to colloidal particulates an effect that is enhanced when in soil with high clay content the behavior provides an additional aid in the element s observed high mobility history background and early claims when the first periodic table of the elements was published by dmitri mendeleev in the early s it showed a in place after uranium similar to several other places for then undiscovered elements other subsequent tables of known elements including a publication of the known radioactive isotopes by kasimir fajans also show an empty place after uranium element up to and after the discovery of the final component of the atomic nucleus the neutron in most scientists did not seriously consider the possibility of elements heavier than uranium while nuclear theory at the time did not explicitly prohibit their existence there was little evidence to suggest that they did however the discovery of induced radioactivity by ir ne and fr d ric joliot curie in late opened up an entirely new method of researching the elements and inspired a small group of italian scientists led by enrico fermi to begin a series of experiments involving neutron bombardment although the joliot curies experiment involved bombarding a sample of al with alpha particles to produce the radioactive p fermi realized that using neutrons which have no electrical charge would most likely produce even better results than the positively charged alpha particles accordingly in march he began systematically subjecting all of the then known elements to neutron bombardment to determine whether others could also be induced to radioactivity after several months of work fermi s group had tentatively determined that lighter elements would disperse the energy of the captured neutron by emitting a proton or alpha particle and heavier elements would generally accomplish the same by emitting a gamma ray this latter behavior would later result in the beta decay of a neutron into a proton thus moving the resulting isotope one place up the periodic table when fermi s team bombarded uranium they observed this behavior as well which strongly suggested that the resulting isotope had an atomic number of fermi was initially reluctant to publicize such a claim but after his team observed several unknown half lives in the uranium bombardment products that did not match those of any known isotope he published a paper entitled possible production of elements of atomic number higher than in june in it he proposed the name ausonium atomic symbol ao for element after the greek name ausonia italy several theoretical objections to the claims of fermi s paper were quickly raised in particular the exact process that took place when an atom captured a neutron was not well understood at the time this and fermi s accidental discovery three months later that nuclear reactions could be induced by slow neutrons cast further doubt in the minds of many scientists notably aristid von grosse and ida noddack that the experiment was creating element while von grosse s claim that fermi was actually producing protactinium element was quickly tested and disproved noddack s proposal that the uranium had been shattered into two or more much smaller fragments was simply ignored by most because existing nuclear theory did not include a way for this to be possible fermi and his team maintained that they were in fact synthesizing a new element but the issue remained unresolved for several years although the many different and unknown radioactive half lives in the experiment s results showed that several nuclear reactions were occurring fermi s group could not prove that element was being created unless they could isolate it chemically they and many other scientists attempted to accomplish this including otto hahn and lise meitner who were among the best radiochemists in the world at the time and supporters of fermi s claim but they all failed much later it was determined that the main reason for this failure was because the predictions of element s chemical properties were based on a periodic table which lacked the actinide series this arrangement placed protactinium below tantalum uranium below tungsten and further suggested that element at that point referred to as eka rhenium should be similar to the group elements including manganese and rhenium thorium protactinium and uranium with their dominant oxidation states of and respectively fooled scientists into thinking they belonged below hafnium tantalum and tungsten rather than below the lanthanide series which was at the time viewed as a fluke and whose members all have dominant states neptunium on the other hand has a much rarer more unstable state with and being the most stable upon finding that plutonium and the other transuranic elements also have dominant and states along with the discovery of the f block the actinide series was firmly established while the question of whether fermi s experiment had produced element was stalemated two additional claims of the discovery of the element appeared although unlike fermi they both claimed to have observed it in nature the first of these claims was by czech engineer odolen koblic in when he extracted a small amount of material from the wash water of heated pitchblende he proposed the name bohemium for the element but after being analyzed it turned out that the sample was a mixture of tungsten and vanadium the other claim in by romanian physicist horia hulubei and french chemist yvette cauchois claimed to have discovered the new element via spectroscopy in minerals they named their element sequanium but the claim was discounted because the prevailing theory at the time was that if it existed at all element would not exist naturally however as neptunium does in fact occur in nature in trace amounts as demonstrated when it was found in uranium ore in it is possible that hulubei and cauchois did in fact observe neptunium although by some scientists including niels bohr were still reluctant to accept that fermi had actually produced a new element he was nevertheless awarded the nobel prize in physics in november for his demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation and for his related discovery of nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons a month later the almost totally unexpected discovery of nuclear fission by hahn meitner and otto frisch put an end to the possibility that fermi had discovered element because most of the unknown half lives that had been observed by fermi s team were rapidly identified as those of fission products perhaps the closest of all attempts to produce the missing element was that conducted by the japanese physicist yoshio nishina working with chemist kenjiro kimura in just before the outbreak of the pacific war in they bombarded u with fast neutrons however while slow neutrons tend to induce neutron capture through a n reaction fast neutrons tend to induce a knock out n n reaction where one neutron is added and two more are removed resulting in the net loss of a neutron nishina and kimura having tested this technique on th and successfully produced the known th and its long lived beta decay daughter pa both occurring in the natural decay chain of u therefore correctly assigned the new day half life activity they observed to the new isotope u they confirmed that this isotope was also a beta emitter and must hence decay to the unknown nuclide they attempted to isolate this nuclide by carrying it with its supposed lighter congener rhenium but no beta or alpha decay was observed from the rhenium containing fraction nishina and kimura thus correctly speculated that the half life of like that of pa was very long and hence its activity would be so weak as to be unmeasurable by their equipment thus concluding the last and closest unsuccessful search for transuranic elements discovery as research on nuclear fission progressed in early edwin mcmillan at the berkeley radiation laboratory of the university of california berkeley decided to run an experiment bombarding uranium using the powerful inch m cyclotron that had recently been built at the university the purpose was to separate the various fission products produced by the bombardment by exploiting the enormous force that the fragments gain from their mutual electrical repulsion after fissioning although he did not discover anything of note from this mcmillan did observe two new beta decay half lives in the uranium trioxide target itself which meant that whatever was producing the radioactivity had not violently repelled each other like normal fission products he quickly realized that one of the half lives closely matched the known minute decay period of uranium but the other half life of days was unknown mcmillan took the results of his experiment to chemist and fellow berkeley professor emilio segr to attempt to isolate the source of the radioactivity both scientists began their work using the prevailing theory that element would have similar chemistry to rhenium but segr rapidly determined that mcmillan s sample was not at all similar to rhenium instead when he reacted it with hydrogen fluoride hf with a strong oxidizing agent present it behaved much like members of the rare earths since these elements comprise a large percentage of fission products segr and mcmillan decided that the half life must have been simply another fission product titling the paper an unsuccessful search for transuranium elements however as more information about fission became available the possibility that the fragments of nuclear fission could still have been present in the target became more remote mcmillan and several scientists including philip h abelson attempted again to determine what was producing the unknown half life in early mcmillan realized that his experiment with segr had failed to test the chemical reactions of the radioactive source with sufficient rigor in a new experiment mcmillan tried subjecting the unknown substance to hf in the presence of a reducing agent something he had not done before this reaction resulted in the sample precipitating with the hf an action that definitively ruled out the possibility that the unknown substance was a rare earth metal shortly after this abelson who had received his graduate degree from the university visited berkeley for a short vacation and mcmillan asked the more able chemist to assist with the separation of the experiment s results abelson very quickly observed that whatever was producing the day half life did not have chemistry like any known element and was actually more similar to uranium than a rare earth metal this discovery finally allowed the source to be isolated and later in led to the classification of the actinide series as a final step mcmillan and abelson prepared a much larger sample of bombarded uranium that had a prominent minute half life from u and demonstrated conclusively that the unknown day half life increased in strength in concert with a decrease in the minute activity through the following reaction u n u min np days pu displaystyle ce u n u beta ce min np beta ce days pu the times are half lives this proved that the unknown radioactive source originated from the decay of uranium and coupled with the previous observation that the source was different chemically from all known elements proved beyond all doubt that a new element had been discovered mcmillan and abelson published their results in a paper entitled radioactive element in the physical review on may they did not propose a name for the element in the paper but they soon decided on the name neptunium since neptune is the next planet beyond uranus in our solar system mcmillan and abelson s success compared to nishina and kimura s near miss can be attributed to the favorable half life of np for radiochemical analysis and quick decay of u in contrast to the slower decay of u and extremely long half life of np subsequent developments it was also realized that the beta decay of np must produce an isotope of element now called plutonium but the quantities involved in mcmillan and abelson s original experiment were too small to isolate and identify plutonium along with neptunium the discovery of plutonium had to wait until the end of when glenn t seaborg and his team identified the isotope plutonium in hahn and fritz strassmann and independently kurt starke reported the confirmation of element in berlin hahn s group did not pursue element likely because they were discouraged by mcmillan and abelson s lack of success in isolating it since they had access to the stronger cyclotron at paris at this point hahn s group would likely have been able to detect element had they tried albeit in tiny quantities a few becquerels neptunium s unique radioactive characteristics allowed it to be traced as it moved through various compounds in chemical reactions at first this was the only method available to prove that its chemistry was different from other elements as the first isotope of neptunium to be discovered has such a short half life mcmillan and abelson were unable to prepare a sample that was large enough to perform chemical analysis of the new element using the technology that was then available however after the discovery of the long lived np isotope in by glenn seaborg and arthur wahl forming weighable amounts of neptunium became a realistic endeavor its half life was initially determined to be about million years later revised to million years confirming the predictions of nishina and kimura of a very long half life early research into the element was somewhat limited because most of the nuclear physicists and chemists in the united states at the time were focused on the massive effort to research the properties of plutonium as part of the manhattan project research into the element did continue as a minor part of the project and the first bulk sample of neptunium was isolated in much of the research into the properties of neptunium since then has been focused on understanding how to confine it as a portion of nuclear waste because it has isotopes with very long half lives it is of particular concern in the context of designing confinement facilities that can last for thousands of years it has found some limited uses as a radioactive tracer and a precursor for various nuclear reactions to produce useful plutonium isotopes however most of the neptunium that is produced as a reaction byproduct in nuclear power stations is considered to be a waste product production synthesis the vast majority of the neptunium that currently exists on earth was produced artificially in nuclear reactions neptunium is the most commonly synthesized isotope due to it being the only one that both can be created via neutron capture and also has a half life long enough to allow weighable quantities to be easily isolated as such it is by far the most common isotope to be utilized in chemical studies of the element when an u atom captures a neutron it is converted to an excited state of u about of the excited u nuclei undergo fission but the remainder decay to the ground state of u by emitting gamma radiation further neutron capture creates u which has a half life of days and quickly decays to np through beta decay during beta decay the excited u emits an electron while the atomic weak interaction converts a neutron to a proton thus creating np u n u m ns u u n u d np displaystyle begin cases ce u n m u ce ns u gamma ce u n u beta ce d np end cases u is also produced via an n n reaction with u this only happens with very energetic neutrons np is the product of alpha decay of am which is produced through neutron irradiation of uranium heavier isotopes of neptunium decay quickly and lighter isotopes of neptunium cannot be produced by neutron capture so chemical separation of neptunium from cooled spent nuclear fuel gives nearly pure np the short lived heavier isotopes np and np useful as radioactive tracers are produced through neutron irradiation of np and u respectively while the longer lived lighter isotopes np and np are produced through irradiation of u with protons and deuterons in a cyclotron artificial np metal is usually isolated through a reaction of npf with liquid barium or lithium at around c and is most often extracted from spent nuclear fuel rods in kilogram amounts as a by product in plutonium production npf ba np baf by weight neptunium discharges are about as great as plutonium discharges and about of spent nuclear fuel discharges however even this fraction still amounts to more than fifty tons per year globally purification methods recovering uranium and plutonium from spent nuclear fuel for reuse is one of the major processes of the nuclear fuel cycle as it has a long half life of just over million years the alpha emitter np is one of the major isotopes of the minor actinides separated from spent nuclear fuel many separation methods have been used to separate out the neptunium operating on small and large scales the small scale purification operations have the goals of preparing pure neptunium as a precursor of metallic neptunium and its compounds and also to isolate and preconcentrate neptunium in samples for analysis most methods that separate neptunium ions exploit the differing chemical behaviour of the differing oxidation states of neptunium from to or sometimes even in solution among the methods that are or have been used are solvent extraction using various extractants usually multidentate diketone derivatives organophosphorus compounds and amine compounds chromatography using various ion exchange or chelating resins coprecipitation possible matrices include laf bipo baso fe oh and mno electrodeposition and biotechnological methods currently commercial reprocessing plants use the purex process involving the solvent extraction of uranium and plutonium with tributyl phosphate chemistry and compounds solution chemistry when it is in an aqueous solution neptunium can exist in any of its five possible oxidation states to and each of these show a characteristic color the stability of each oxidation state is strongly dependent on various factors such as the presence of oxidizing or reducing agents ph of the solution presence of coordination complex forming ligands and even the concentration of neptunium in the solution in acidic solutions the neptunium iii to neptunium vii ions exist as np np npo npo and npo in basic solutions they exist as the oxides and hydroxides np oh npo npo oh npo oh and npo not as much work has been done to characterize neptunium in basic solutions np and np can easily be reduced and oxidized to each other as can npo and npo neptunium iii np iii or np exists as hydrated complexes in acidic solutions np h o n it is a dark blue purple and is analogous to its lighter congener the pink rare earth ion pm in the presence of oxygen it is quickly oxidized to np iv unless strong reducing agents are also present nevertheless it is the second least easily hydrolyzed neptunium ion in water forming the npoh ion np is the predominant neptunium ion in solutions of ph neptunium iv np iv or np is pale yellow green in acidic solutions where it exists as hydrated complexes np h o n it is quite unstable to hydrolysis in acidic aqueous solutions at ph and above forming npoh in basic solutions np tends to hydrolyze to form the neutral neptunium iv hydroxide np oh and neptunium iv oxide npo neptunium v np v or npo is green blue in aqueous solution in which it behaves as a strong lewis acid it is a stable ion and is the most common form of neptunium in aqueous solutions unlike its neighboring homologues uo and puo npo does not spontaneously disproportionate except at very low ph and high concentration npo h np npo h oit hydrolyzes in basic solutions to form npo oh and npo oh neptunium vi np vi or npo the neptunyl ion shows a light pink or reddish color in an acidic solution and yellow green otherwise it is a strong lewis acid and is the main neptunium ion encountered in solutions of ph though stable in acidic solutions it is quite easily reduced to the np v ion and it is not as stable as the homologous hexavalent ions of its neighbours uranium and plutonium the uranyl and plutonyl ions it hydrolyzes in basic solutions to form the oxo and hydroxo ions npo oh npo oh and npo oh neptunium vii np vii is dark green in a strongly basic solution though its chemical formula in basic solution is frequently cited as npo this is a simplification and the real structure is probably closer to a hydroxo species like npo oh np vii was first prepared in basic solution in in strongly acidic solution np vii is found as npo water quickly reduces this to np vi its hydrolysis products are uncharacterized hydroxides the oxides and hydroxides of neptunium are closely related to its ions in general np hydroxides at various oxidation levels are less stable than the actinides before it on the periodic table such as thorium and uranium and more stable than those after it such as plutonium and americium this phenomenon is because the stability of an ion increases as the ratio of atomic number to the radius of the ion increases thus actinides higher on the periodic table will more readily undergo hydrolysis neptunium iii hydroxide is quite stable in acidic solutions and in environments that lack oxygen but it will rapidly oxidize to the iv state in the presence of air it is not soluble in water np iv hydroxides exist mainly as the electrically neutral np oh and its mild solubility in water is not affected at all by the ph of the solution this suggests that the other np iv hydroxide np oh does not have a significant presence because the np v ion npo is very stable it can only form a hydroxide in high acidity levels when placed in a m sodium perchlorate solution it does not react significantly for a period of months although a higher molar concentration of m will result in it reacting to the solid hydroxide npo oh almost immediately np vi hydroxide is more reactive but it is still fairly stable in acidic solutions it will form the compound npo h o in the presence of ozone under various carbon dioxide pressures np vii has not been well studied and no neutral hydroxides have been reported it probably exists mostly as npo oh oxides three anhydrous neptunium oxides have been reported npo np o and np o though some studies have stated that only the first two of these exist suggesting that claims of np o are actually the result of mistaken analysis of np o however as the full extent of the reactions that occur between neptunium and oxygen has yet to be researched it is not certain which of these claims is accurate although neptunium oxides have not been produced with neptunium in oxidation states as high as those possible with the adjacent actinide uranium neptunium oxides are more stable at lower oxidation states this behavior is illustrated by the fact that npo can be produced by simply burning neptunium salts of oxyacids in air the greenish brown npo is very stable over a large range of pressures and temperatures and does not undergo phase transitions at low temperatures it does show a phase transition from face centered cubic to orthorhombic at around gpa although it returns to is original phase when pressure is released it remains stable under oxygen pressures up to mpa and temperatures up to c np o is black brown in color and monoclinic with a lattice size of picometres it is relatively unstable and decomposes to npo and o at c although np o was initially subject to several studies that claimed to produce it with mutually contradictory methods it was eventually prepared successfully by heating neptunium peroxide to c for hours or by heating it under a layer of water in an ampoule at c neptunium also forms a large number of oxide compounds with a wide variety of elements although the neptunate oxides formed with alkali metals and alkaline earth metals have been by far the most studied ternary neptunium oxides are generally formed by reacting npo with the oxide of another element or by precipitating from an alkaline solution li npo has been prepared by reacting li o and npo at c for hours or by reacting li o with npo h o at c for hours in a quartz tube and flowing oxygen alkali neptunate compounds k npo cs npo and rb npo are all created by a similar reaction npo mo m npo m k cs rb the oxide compounds knpo csnpo and rbnpo are formed by reacting np vii npo oh with a compound of the alkali metal nitrate and ozone additional compounds have been produced by reacting npo and water with solid alkali and alkaline peroxides at temperatures of c for hours some of these include ba npo ba nanpo and ba linpo also a considerable number of hexavalent neptunium oxides are formed by reacting solid state npo with various alkali or alkaline earth oxides in an environment of flowing oxygen many of the resulting compounds also have an equivalent compound that substitutes uranium for neptunium some compounds that have been characterized include na np o na npo na npo and na npo these can be obtained by heating different combinations of npo and na o to various temperature thresholds and further heating will also cause these compounds to exhibit different neptunium allotropes the lithium neptunate oxides li npo and li npo can be obtained with similar reactions of npo and li o a large number of additional alkali and alkaline neptunium oxide compounds such as cs np o and cs np o have been characterized with various production methods neptunium has also been observed to form ternary oxides with many additional elements in groups through although these compounds are much less well studied halides although neptunium halide compounds have not been nearly as well studied as its oxides a fairly large number have been successfully characterized of these neptunium fluorides have been the most extensively researched largely because of their potential use in separating the element from nuclear waste products four binary neptunium fluoride compounds npf npf npf and npf have been reported the first two are fairly stable and were first prepared in through the following reactions npo h hf npf h o c npf o hf npf h o c later npf was obtained directly by heating npo to various temperatures in mixtures of either hydrogen fluoride or pure fluorine gas npf is much more difficult to create and most known preparation methods involve reacting npf or npf compounds with various other fluoride compounds npf will decompose into npf and npf when heated to around c npf or neptunium hexafluoride is extremely volatile as are its adjacent actinide compounds uranium hexafluoride uf and plutonium hexafluoride puf this volatility has attracted a large amount of interest to the compound in an attempt to devise a simple method for extracting neptunium from spent nuclear power station fuel rods npf was first prepared in by reacting npf and gaseous fluorine at very high temperatures and the first bulk quantities were obtained in by heating npf and dripping pure fluorine on it in a specially prepared apparatus additional methods that have successfully produced neptunium hexafluoride include reacting brf and brf with npf and by reacting several different neptunium oxide and fluoride compounds with anhydrous hydrogen fluorides four neptunium oxyfluoride compounds npo f npof npo f and npof have been reported although none of them have been extensively studied npo f is a pinkish solid and can be prepared by reacting npo h o and np f with pure fluorine at around c npof and npof can be produced by reacting neptunium oxides with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride at various temperatures neptunium also forms a wide variety of fluoride compounds with various elements some of these that have been characterized include csnpf rb npf na npf and k npo f two neptunium chlorides npcl and npcl have been characterized although several attempts to create npcl have been made they have not been successful npcl is created by reducing neptunium dioxide with hydrogen and carbon tetrachloride ccl and npcl by reacting a neptunium oxide with ccl at around c other neptunium chloride compounds have also been reported including npocl cs npcl cs npo cl and cs nanpcl neptunium bromides npbr and npbr have also been created the latter by reacting aluminium bromide with npo at c and the former in an almost identical procedure but with zinc present the neptunium iodide npi has also been prepared by the same method as npbr chalcogenides pnictides and carbides neptunium chalcogen and pnictogen compounds have been well studied primarily as part of research into their electronic and magnetic properties and their interactions in the natural environment pnictide and carbide compounds have also attracted interest because of their presence in the fuel of several advanced nuclear reactor designs although the latter group has not had nearly as much research as the former chalcogenidesa wide variety of neptunium sulfide compounds have been characterized including the pure sulfide compounds nps nps np s np s np s and np s of these np s prepared by reacting npo with hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide at around c is the most well studied and three allotropic forms are known the form exists up to around c the up to c and the form which can also exist as np s at higher temperatures nps can be created by reacting np s and neptunium metal at c and np s can be prepared by the decomposition of np s at c or by reacting sulfur and neptunium hydride at c np s is made by heating a mixture of np s and pure sulfur to c all of the neptunium sulfides except for the and forms of np s are isostructural with the equivalent uranium sulfide and several including nps np s and np s are also isostructural with the equivalent plutonium sulfide the oxysulfides npos np o s and np o s have also been created although the latter three have not been well studied npos was first prepared in by vacuum sealing npo np s and pure sulfur in a quartz tube and heating it to c for one week neptunium selenide compounds that have been reported include npse npse np se np se np se and np se all of these have only been obtained by heating neptunium hydride and selenium metal to various temperatures in a vacuum for an extended period of time and np se is only known to exist in the allotrope at relatively high temperatures two neptunium oxyselenide compounds are known npose and np o se are formed with similar methods by replacing the neptunium hydride with neptunium dioxide the known neptunium telluride compounds npte npte np te np te and np o te are formed by similar procedures to the selenides and np o te is isostructural to the equivalent uranium and plutonium compounds no neptunium polonium compounds have been reported pnictides and carbidesneptunium nitride npn was first prepared in by reacting neptunium hydride and ammonia gas at around c in a quartz capillary tube later it was produced by reacting different mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen with neptunium metal at various temperatures it has also been created by the reduction of neptunium dioxide with diatomic nitrogen gas at c npn is isomorphous with uranium mononitride un and plutonium mononitride pun and has a melting point of c under a nitrogen pressure of around mpa two neptunium phosphide compounds have been reported npp and np p the first has a face centered cubic structure and is prepared by converting neptunium metal to a powder and then reacting it with phosphine gas at c np p can be created by reacting neptunium metal with red phosphorus at c in a vacuum and then allowing any extra phosphorus to sublimate away the compound is non reactive with water but will react with nitric acid to produce np iv solution three neptunium arsenide compounds have been prepared npas npas and np as the first two were first created by heating arsenic and neptunium hydride in a vacuum sealed tube for about a week later npas was also made by confining neptunium metal and arsenic in a vacuum tube separating them with a quartz membrane and heating them to just below neptunium s melting point of c which is slightly higher than the arsenic s sublimation point of c np as is prepared by a similar procedure using iodine as a transporting agent npas crystals are brownish gold and np as is black the neptunium antimonide compound npsb was created in by placing equal quantities of both elements in a vacuum tube heating them to the melting point of antimony and then heating it further to c for sixteen days this procedure also created trace amounts of an additional antimonide compound np sb one neptunium bismuth compound npbi has also been reported the neptunium carbides npc np c and npc tentative have been reported but have not characterized in detail despite the high importance and utility of actinide carbides as advanced nuclear reactor fuel npc is a non stoichiometric compound and could be better labelled as npcx x it may be obtained from the reaction of neptunium hydride with graphite at c or by heating the constituent elements together in an electric arc furnace using a tungsten electrode it reacts with excess carbon to form pure np c npc is formed from heating npo in a graphite crucible at c other inorganic hydridesneptunium reacts with hydrogen in a similar manner to its neighbor plutonium forming the hydrides nph x face centered cubic and nph hexagonal these are isostructural with the corresponding plutonium hydrides although unlike puh x the lattice parameters of nph x become greater as the hydrogen content x increases the hydrides require extreme care in handling as they decompose in a vacuum at c to form finely divided neptunium metal which is pyrophoric phosphates sulfates and carbonatesbeing chemically stable neptunium phosphates have been investigated for potential use in immobilizing nuclear waste neptunium pyrophosphate npp o a green solid has been produced in the reaction between neptunium dioxide and boron phosphate at c though neptunium iv phosphate has so far remained elusive the series of compounds npm po where m is an alkali metal li na k rb or cs are all known some neptunium sulfates have been characterized both aqueous and solid and at various oxidation states of neptunium iv through vi have been observed additionally neptunium carbonates have been investigated to achieve a better understanding of the behavior of neptunium in geological repositories and the environment where it may come into contact with carbonate and bicarbonate aqueous solutions and form soluble complexes organometallic a few organoneptunium compounds are known and chemically characterized although not as many as for uranium due to neptunium s scarcity and radioactivity the most well known organoneptunium compounds are the cyclopentadienyl and cyclooctatetraenyl compounds and their derivatives the trivalent cyclopentadienyl compound np c h thf was obtained in from reacting np c h cl with sodium although the simpler np c h could not be obtained tetravalent neptunium cyclopentadienyl a reddish brown complex was synthesized in by reacting neptunium iv chloride with potassium cyclopentadienide npcl kc h np c h kclit is soluble in benzene and thf and is less sensitive to oxygen and water than pu c h and am c h other np iv cyclopentadienyl compounds are known for many ligands they have the general formula c h npl where l represents a ligand neptunocene np c h was synthesized in by reacting neptunium iv chloride with k c h it is isomorphous to uranocene and plutonocene and they behave chemically identically all three compounds are insensitive to water or dilute bases but are sensitive to air reacting quickly to form oxides and are only slightly soluble in benzene and toluene other known neptunium cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives include np rc h r ethanol butanol and knp c h thf which is isostructural to the corresponding plutonium compound in addition neptunium hydrocarbyls have been prepared and solvated triiodide complexes of neptunium are a precursor to many organoneptunium and inorganic neptunium compounds coordination complexes there is much interest in the coordination chemistry of neptunium because its five oxidation states all exhibit their own distinctive chemical behavior and the coordination chemistry of the actinides is heavily influenced by the actinide contraction the greater than expected decrease in ionic radii across the actinide series analogous to the lanthanide contraction solid state few neptunium iii coordination compounds are known because np iii is readily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen while in aqueous solution however sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate can reduce np iv to np iii stabilizing the lower oxidation state and forming various sparingly soluble np iii coordination complexes such as np c o h o np c h aso h o and np c h oh coo many neptunium iv coordination compounds have been reported the first one being et n np ncs which is isostructural with the analogous uranium iv coordination compound other np iv coordination compounds are known some involving other metals such as cobalt conp f h o formed at k and copper cunp f h o formed at k complex nitrate compounds are also known the experimenters who produced them in and produced single crystals by slow evaporation of the np iv solution at ambient temperature in concentrated nitric acid and excess pyrimidine the coordination chemistry of neptunium v has been extensively researched due to the presence of cation cation interactions in the solid state which had been already known for actinyl ions some known such compounds include the neptunyl dimer na npo c o h o and neptunium glycolate both of which form green crystals neptunium vi compounds range from the simple oxalate npo c o which is unstable usually becoming np iv to such complicated compounds as the green nh npo co extensive study has been performed on compounds of the form m ano co where m represents a monovalent cation and an is either uranium neptunium or plutonium since when neptunium vii was discovered some coordination compounds with neptunium in the oxidation state have been prepared and studied the first reported such compound was initially characterized as co nh npo nh o in but was suggested in to actually have the formula co nh npo oh h o based on the fact that np vii occurs as npo oh in aqueous solution this compound forms dark green prismatic crystals with maximum edge length mm in aqueous solution most neptunium coordination complexes known in solution involve the element in the and oxidation states only a few studies have been done on neptunium iii and vii coordination complexes for the former npx and npx x cl br were obtained in in concentrated licl and libr solutions respectively for the latter experiments discovered that the npo ion could form sulfate complexes in acidic solutions such as npo so and npo so these were found to have higher stability constants than the neptunyl ion npo a great many complexes for the other neptunium oxidation states are known the inorganic ligands involved are the halides iodate azide nitride nitrate thiocyanate sulfate carbonate chromate and phosphate many organic ligands are known to be able to be used in neptunium coordination complexes they include acetate propionate glycolate lactate oxalate malonate phthalate mellitate and citrate analogously to its neighbours uranium and plutonium the order of the neptunium ions in terms of complex formation ability is np npo np npo the relative order of the middle two neptunium ions depends on the ligands and solvents used the stability sequence for np iv np v and np vi complexes with monovalent inorganic ligands is f h po scn no cl clo the order for divalent inorganic ligands is co hpo so these follow the strengths of the corresponding acids the divalent ligands are more strongly complexing than the monovalent ones npo can also form the complex ions npo m m al ga sc in fe cr rh in perchloric acid solution the strength of interaction between the two cations follows the order fe in sc ga al the neptunyl and uranyl ions can also form a complex together applications precursor in plutonium production an important use of np is as a precursor in plutonium production where it is irradiated with neutrons to create pu an alpha emitter for radioisotope thermal generators for spacecraft and military applications np will capture a neutron to form np and beta decay with a half life of just over two days to pu np n np d pu displaystyle ce np n np beta ce d pu pu also exists in sizable quantities in spent nuclear fuel but would have to be separated from other isotopes of plutonium irradiating neptunium with electron beams provoking bremsstrahlung also produces quite pure samples of the isotope plutonium useful as a tracer to determine plutonium concentration in the environment weapons neptunium is fissionable and could theoretically be used as fuel in a fast neutron reactor or a nuclear weapon with a critical mass of around kilograms in the u s department of energy declassified the statement that neptunium can be used for a nuclear explosive device it is not believed that an actual weapon has ever been constructed using neptunium as of the world production of neptunium by commercial power reactors was over critical masses a year but to extract the isotope from irradiated fuel elements would be a major industrial undertaking in september researchers at the los alamos national laboratory briefly created the first known nuclear critical mass using neptunium in combination with shells of enriched uranium uranium discovering that the critical mass of a bare sphere of neptunium ranges from kilogram weights in the high fifties to low sixties showing that it is about as good a bomb material as uranium the united states federal government made plans in march to move america s supply of separated neptunium to a nuclear waste disposal site in nevada physics np is used in devices for detecting high energy mev neutrons role in nuclear waste neptunium accumulates in commercial household ionization chamber smoke detectors from decay of the typically microgram of americium initially present as a source of ionizing radiation with a half life of years the americium in an ionization smoke detector includes about neptunium after years and about after years neptunium is the most mobile actinide in the deep geological repository environment this makes it and its predecessors such as americium candidates of interest for destruction by nuclear transmutation due to its long half life neptunium will become the major contributor of the total radiotoxicity in years as it is unclear what happens to the containment in that long time span an extraction of the neptunium would minimize the contamination of the environment if the nuclear waste could be mobilized after several thousand years biological role and precautions neptunium does not have a biological role as it has a short half life and occurs only in small traces naturally animal tests showed that it is not absorbed via the digestive tract when injected it concentrates in the bones from which it is slowly released finely divided neptunium metal presents a fire hazard because neptunium is pyrophoric small grains will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature ,93
Plutonium,Pu,plutonium is a radioactive chemical element with the symbol pu and atomic number it is an actinide metal of silvery gray appearance that tarnishes when exposed to air and forms a dull coating when oxidized the element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states it reacts with carbon halogens nitrogen silicon and hydrogen when exposed to moist air it forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to in volume which in turn flake off as a powder that is pyrophoric it is radioactive and can accumulate in bones which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous plutonium was first synthetically produced and isolated in late and early by a deuteron bombardment of uranium in the metre in cyclotron at the university of california berkeley first neptunium half life days was synthesized which subsequently beta decayed to form the new element with atomic number and atomic weight half life years since uranium had been named after the planet uranus and neptunium after the planet neptune element was named after pluto which at the time was considered to be a planet as well wartime secrecy prevented the university of california team from publishing its discovery until plutonium is the element with the highest atomic number to occur in nature trace quantities arise in natural uranium deposits when uranium captures neutrons emitted by decay of other uranium atoms both plutonium and plutonium are fissile meaning that they can sustain a nuclear chain reaction leading to applications in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors plutonium exhibits a high rate of spontaneous fission raising the neutron flux of any sample containing it the presence of plutonium limits a plutonium sample s usability for weapons or its quality as reactor fuel and the percentage of plutonium determines its grade weapons grade fuel grade or reactor grade plutonium has a half life of years and emits alpha particles it is a heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators which are used to power some spacecraft plutonium isotopes are expensive and inconvenient to separate so particular isotopes are usually manufactured in specialized reactors producing plutonium in useful quantities for the first time was a major part of the manhattan project during world war ii that developed the first atomic bombs the fat man bombs used in the trinity nuclear test in july and in the bombing of nagasaki in august had plutonium cores human radiation experiments studying plutonium were conducted without informed consent and several criticality accidents some lethal occurred after the war disposal of plutonium waste from nuclear power plants and dismantled nuclear weapons built during the cold war is a nuclear proliferation and environmental concern other sources of plutonium in the environment are fallout from numerous above ground nuclear tests now banned characteristics physical properties plutonium like most metals has a bright silvery appearance at first much like nickel but it oxidizes very quickly to a dull gray although yellow and olive green are also reported at room temperature plutonium is in its alpha form this the most common structural form of the element allotrope is about as hard and brittle as gray cast iron unless it is alloyed with other metals to make it soft and ductile unlike most metals it is not a good conductor of heat or electricity it has a low melting point c f and an unusually high boiling point c f this gives a large range of temperatures over kelvin wide at which plutonium is liquid but this range is neither the greatest among all actinides nor among all metals the low melting point as well as the reactivity of the native metal compared to the oxide leads to plutonium oxides being a preferred form for applications such as nuclear fission reactor fuel mox fuel alpha decay the release of a high energy helium nucleus is the most common form of radioactive decay for plutonium a kg mass of pu contains about atoms with a half life of years about of its atoms decay each second by emitting a mev alpha particle this amounts to watts of power heat produced by the deceleration of these alpha particles makes it warm to the touch pu due to its much shorter half life heats up to much higher temperatures and glows red hot with blackbody radiation if left without external heating or cooling this heat has been used in radioisotope thermoelectric generators see below resistivity is a measure of how strongly a material opposes the flow of electric current the resistivity of plutonium at room temperature is very high for a metal and it gets even higher with lower temperatures which is unusual for metals this trend continues down to k below which resistivity rapidly decreases for fresh samples resistivity then begins to increase with time at around k due to radiation damage with the rate dictated by the isotopic composition of the sample because of self irradiation a sample of plutonium fatigues throughout its crystal structure meaning the ordered arrangement of its atoms becomes disrupted by radiation with time self irradiation can also lead to annealing which counteracts some of the fatigue effects as temperature increases above k unlike most materials plutonium increases in density when it melts by but the liquid metal exhibits a linear decrease in density with temperature near the melting point the liquid plutonium has very high viscosity and surface tension compared to other metals allotropes plutonium normally has six allotropes and forms a seventh zeta at high temperature within a limited pressure range these allotropes which are different structural modifications or forms of an element have very similar internal energies but significantly varying densities and crystal structures this makes plutonium very sensitive to changes in temperature pressure or chemistry and allows for dramatic volume changes following phase transitions from one allotropic form to another the densities of the different allotropes vary from g cm to g cm the presence of these many allotropes makes machining plutonium very difficult as it changes state very readily for example the form exists at room temperature in unalloyed plutonium it has machining characteristics similar to cast iron but changes to the plastic and malleable beta form at slightly higher temperatures the reasons for the complicated phase diagram are not entirely understood the form has a low symmetry monoclinic structure hence its brittleness strength compressibility and poor thermal conductivity plutonium in the delta form normally exists in the c to c range but is stable at room temperature when alloyed with a small percentage of gallium aluminium or cerium enhancing workability and allowing it to be welded the form has more typical metallic character and is roughly as strong and malleable as aluminium in fission weapons the explosive shock waves used to compress a plutonium core will also cause a transition from the usual phase plutonium to the denser form significantly helping to achieve supercriticality the phase the highest temperature solid allotrope exhibits anomalously high atomic self diffusion compared to other elements nuclear fission plutonium is a radioactive actinide metal whose isotope plutonium is one of the three primary fissile isotopes uranium and uranium are the other two plutonium is also highly fissile to be considered fissile an isotope s atomic nucleus must be able to break apart or fission when struck by a slow moving neutron and to release enough additional neutrons to sustain the nuclear chain reaction by splitting further nuclei pure plutonium may have a multiplication factor keff larger than one which means that if the metal is present in sufficient quantity and with an appropriate geometry e g a sphere of sufficient size it can form a critical mass during fission a fraction of the nuclear binding energy which holds a nucleus together is released as a large amount of electromagnetic and kinetic energy much of the latter being quickly converted to thermal energy fission of a kilogram of plutonium can produce an explosion equivalent to tons of tnt gj it is this energy that makes plutonium useful in nuclear weapons and reactors the presence of the isotope plutonium in a sample limits its nuclear bomb potential as plutonium has a relatively high spontaneous fission rate fissions per second per gram over neutrons per second per gram raising the background neutron levels and thus increasing the risk of predetonation plutonium is identified as either weapons grade fuel grade or reactor grade based on the percentage of plutonium that it contains weapons grade plutonium contains less than plutonium fuel grade plutonium contains from to less than and power reactor grade contains or more plutonium supergrade plutonium with less than of plutonium is used in u s navy weapons stored in proximity to ship and submarine crews due to its lower radioactivity the isotope plutonium is not fissile but can undergo nuclear fission easily with fast neutrons as well as alpha decay all plutonium isotopes can be bred into fissile material with one or more neutron absorptions whether followed by beta decay or not this makes non fissile isotopes of plutonium a fertile material isotopes and nucleosynthesis twenty radioactive isotopes of plutonium have been characterized the longest lived are plutonium with a half life of million years plutonium with a half life of years and plutonium with a half life of years all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are less than years this element also has eight metastable states though all have half lives less than one second plutonium has been found in interstellar space and is has the longest half life of any non primordial radioisotope the known isotopes of plutonium range in mass number from to the primary decay modes of isotopes with mass numbers lower than the most stable isotope plutonium are spontaneous fission and alpha emission mostly forming uranium protons and neptunium protons isotopes as decay products neglecting the wide range of daughter nuclei created by fission processes the primary decay mode for isotopes with mass numbers higher than plutonium is beta emission mostly forming americium protons isotopes as decay products plutonium is the parent isotope of the neptunium decay series decaying to americium via beta emission plutonium and are the most widely synthesized isotopes plutonium is synthesized via the following reaction using uranium u and neutrons n via beta decay with neptunium np as an intermediate u n u min np d pu displaystyle ce u n u beta ce min np beta ce d pu neutrons from the fission of uranium are captured by uranium nuclei to form uranium a beta decay converts a neutron into a proton to form neptunium half life days and another beta decay forms plutonium egon bretscher working on the british tube alloys project predicted this reaction theoretically in plutonium is synthesized by bombarding uranium with deuterons d the nuclei of heavy hydrogen in the following reaction u d np n np d pu displaystyle begin aligned ce u d ce np n ce np beta ce d pu end aligned in this process a deuteron hitting uranium produces two neutrons and neptunium which spontaneously decays by emitting negative beta particles to form plutonium plutonium can also be produced by neutron irradiation of neptunium decay heat and fission properties plutonium isotopes undergo radioactive decay which produces decay heat different isotopes produce different amounts of heat per mass the decay heat is usually listed as watt kilogram or milliwatt gram in larger pieces of plutonium e g a weapon pit and inadequate heat removal the resulting self heating may be significant compounds and chemistry at room temperature pure plutonium is silvery in color but gains a tarnish when oxidized the element displays four common ionic oxidation states in aqueous solution and one rare one pu iii as pu blue lavender pu iv as pu yellow brown pu v as puo light pink pu vi as puo pink orange pu vii as puo green the heptavalent ion is rare the color shown by plutonium solutions depends on both the oxidation state and the nature of the acid anion it is the acid anion that influences the degree of complexing how atoms connect to a central atom of the plutonium species additionally the formal oxidation state of plutonium is known in the complex k cryptand puiicp cp c h sime a oxidation state is possible as well in the volatile tetroxide puo though it readily decomposes via a reduction mechanism similar to feo puo can be stabilized in alkaline solutions and chloroform metallic plutonium is produced by reacting plutonium tetrafluoride with barium calcium or lithium at c metallic plutonium is attacked by acids oxygen and steam but not by alkalis and dissolves easily in concentrated hydrochloric hydroiodic and perchloric acids molten metal must be kept in a vacuum or an inert atmosphere to avoid reaction with air at c the metal will ignite in air and will explode if placed in carbon tetrachloride plutonium is a reactive metal in moist air or moist argon the metal oxidizes rapidly producing a mixture of oxides and hydrides if the metal is exposed long enough to a limited amount of water vapor a powdery surface coating of puo is formed also formed is plutonium hydride but an excess of water vapor forms only puo plutonium shows enormous and reversible reaction rates with pure hydrogen forming plutonium hydride it also reacts readily with oxygen forming puo and puo as well as intermediate oxides plutonium oxide fills more volume than plutonium metal the metal reacts with the halogens giving rise to compounds with the general formula pux where x can be f cl br or i and puf is also seen the following oxyhalides are observed puocl puobr and puoi it will react with carbon to form puc nitrogen to form pun and silicon to form pusi the organometallic chemistry of plutonium complexes is typical for organoactinide species a characteristic example of an organoplutonium compound is plutonocene computational chemistry methods indicate an enhanced covalent character in the plutonium ligand bonding powders of plutonium its hydrides and certain oxides like pu o are pyrophoric meaning they can ignite spontaneously at ambient temperature and are therefore handled in an inert dry atmosphere of nitrogen or argon bulk plutonium ignites only when heated above c pu o spontaneously heats up and transforms into puo which is stable in dry air but reacts with water vapor when heated crucibles used to contain plutonium need to be able to withstand its strongly reducing properties refractory metals such as tantalum and tungsten along with the more stable oxides borides carbides nitrides and silicides can tolerate this melting in an electric arc furnace can be used to produce small ingots of the metal without the need for a crucible cerium is used as a chemical simulant of plutonium for development of containment extraction and other technologies electronic structure plutonium is an element in which the f electrons are the transition border between delocalized and localized it is therefore considered one of the most complex elements the anomalous behavior of plutonium is caused by its electronic structure the energy difference between the d and f subshells is very low the size of the f shell is just enough to allow the electrons to form bonds within the lattice on the very boundary between localized and bonding behavior the proximity of energy levels leads to multiple low energy electron configurations with near equal energy levels this leads to competing fn s and fn d s configurations which causes the complexity of its chemical behavior the highly directional nature of f orbitals is responsible for directional covalent bonds in molecules and complexes of plutonium alloys plutonium can form alloys and intermediate compounds with most other metals exceptions include lithium sodium potassium rubidium and caesium of the alkali metals and magnesium calcium strontium and barium of the alkaline earth metals and europium and ytterbium of the rare earth metals partial exceptions include the refractory metals chromium molybdenum niobium tantalum and tungsten which are soluble in liquid plutonium but insoluble or only slightly soluble in solid plutonium gallium aluminium americium scandium and cerium can stabilize the phase of plutonium for room temperature silicon indium zinc and zirconium allow formation of metastable state when rapidly cooled high amounts of hafnium holmium and thallium also allows some retention of the phase at room temperature neptunium is the only element that can stabilize the phase at higher temperatures plutonium alloys can be produced by adding a metal to molten plutonium if the alloying metal is sufficiently reductive plutonium can be added in the form of oxides or halides the phase plutonium gallium and plutonium aluminium alloys are produced by adding plutonium iii fluoride to molten gallium or aluminium which has the advantage of avoiding dealing directly with the highly reactive plutonium metal plutonium gallium is used for stabilizing the phase of plutonium avoiding the phase and related issues its main use is in pits of implosion nuclear weapons plutonium aluminium is an alternative to the pu ga alloy it was the original element considered for phase stabilization but its tendency to react with the alpha particles and release neutrons reduces its usability for nuclear weapon pits plutonium aluminium alloy can be also used as a component of nuclear fuel plutonium gallium cobalt alloy pucoga is an unconventional superconductor showing superconductivity below k an order of magnitude higher than the highest between heavy fermion systems and has large critical current plutonium zirconium alloy can be used as nuclear fuel plutonium cerium and plutonium cerium cobalt alloys are used as nuclear fuels plutonium uranium with about mol plutonium can be used as a nuclear fuel for fast breeder reactors its pyrophoric nature and high susceptibility to corrosion to the point of self igniting or disintegrating after exposure to air require alloying with other components addition of aluminium carbon or copper does not improve disintegration rates markedly zirconium and iron alloys have better corrosion resistance but they disintegrate in several months in air as well addition of titanium and or zirconium significantly increases the melting point of the alloy plutonium uranium titanium and plutonium uranium zirconium were investigated for use as nuclear fuels the addition of the third element increases corrosion resistance reduces flammability and improves ductility fabricability strength and thermal expansion plutonium uranium molybdenum has the best corrosion resistance forming a protective film of oxides but titanium and zirconium are preferred for physics reasons thorium uranium plutonium was investigated as a nuclear fuel for fast breeder reactors occurrence trace amounts of plutonium plutonium plutonium and plutonium can be found in nature small traces of plutonium a few parts per trillion and its decay products are naturally found in some concentrated ores of uranium such as the natural nuclear fission reactor in oklo gabon the ratio of plutonium to uranium at the cigar lake mine uranium deposit ranges from to these trace amounts of pu originate in the following fashion on rare occasions u undergoes spontaneous fission and in the process the nucleus emits one or two free neutrons with some kinetic energy when one of these neutrons strikes the nucleus of another u atom it is absorbed by the atom which becomes u with a relatively short half life u decays to np which decays into pu finally exceedingly small amounts of plutonium attributed to the extremely rare double beta decay of uranium have been found in natural uranium samples due to its relatively long half life of about million years it was suggested that plutonium occurs naturally as a primordial nuclide but early reports of its detection could not be confirmed however its long half life ensured its circulation across the solar system before its extinction and indeed evidence of the spontaneous fission of extinct pu has been found in meteorites the former presence of pu in the early solar system has been confirmed since it manifests itself today as an excess of its daughters either th from the alpha decay pathway or xenon isotopes from its spontaneous fission the latter are generally more useful because the chemistries of thorium and plutonium are rather similar both are predominantly tetravalent and hence an excess of thorium would not be strong evidence that some of it was formed as a plutonium daughter pu has the longest half life of all transuranic nuclides and is produced only in the r process in supernovae and colliding neutron stars when nuclei are ejected from these events at high speed to reach earth pu alone among transuranic nuclides has a long enough half life to survive the journey and hence tiny traces of live interstellar pu have been found in the deep sea floor because pu also occurs in the decay chain of pu it must thus also be present in secular equilibrium albeit in even tinier quantities minute traces of plutonium are usually found in the human body due to the atmospheric and underwater nuclear tests that have been carried out and to a small number of major nuclear accidents most atmospheric and underwater nuclear testing was stopped by the limited test ban treaty in which of the nuclear powers was signed and ratified by the united states united kingdom and soviet union france would continue atmospheric nuclear testing until and china would continue atmospheric nuclear testing until all subsequent nuclear testing was conducted underground history discovery enrico fermi and a team of scientists at the university of rome reported that they had discovered element in fermi called the element hesperium and mentioned it in his nobel lecture in the sample actually contained products of nuclear fission primarily barium and krypton nuclear fission discovered in germany in by otto hahn and fritz strassmann was unknown at the time plutonium specifically plutonium was first produced isolated and then chemically identified between december and february by glenn t seaborg edwin mcmillan emilio segr joseph w kennedy and arthur wahl by deuteron bombardment of uranium in the inch cm cyclotron at the berkeley radiation laboratory at the university of california berkeley neptunium was created directly by the bombardment but decayed by beta emission with a half life of a little over two days which indicated the formation of element the first bombardment took place on december and the new element was first identified through oxidation on the night of february a paper documenting the discovery was prepared by the team and sent to the journal physical review in march but publication was delayed until a year after the end of world war ii due to security concerns at the cavendish laboratory in cambridge egon bretscher and norman feather realized that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial amounts of plutonium as a by product they calculated that element would be fissile and had the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium and could easily be separated from it mcmillan had recently named the first transuranic element neptunium after the planet neptune and suggested that element being the next element in the series be named for what was then considered the next planet pluto nicholas kemmer of the cambridge team independently proposed the same name based on the same reasoning as the berkeley team seaborg originally considered the name plutium but later thought that it did not sound as good as plutonium he chose the letters pu as a joke in reference to the interjection p u to indicate an especially disgusting smell which passed without notice into the periodic table alternative names considered by seaborg and others were ultimium or extremium because of the erroneous belief that they had found the last possible element on the periodic table hahn and strassmann and independently kurt starke were at this point also working on transuranic elements in berlin it is likely that hahn and strassmann were aware that plutonium should be fissile however they did not have a strong neutron source element was reported by hahn and strassmann as well as starke in hahn s group did not pursue element likely because they were discouraged by mcmillan and abelson s lack of success in isolating it when they had first found element however since hahn s group had access to the stronger cyclotron at paris at this point they would likely have been able to detect plutonium had they tried albeit in tiny quantities a few becquerels early research the chemistry of plutonium was found to resemble uranium after a few months of initial study early research was continued at the secret metallurgical laboratory of the university of chicago on august a trace quantity of this element was isolated and measured for the first time about micrograms of plutonium combined with uranium and fission products was produced and only about microgram was isolated this procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element s atomic weight on december on a racket court under the west grandstand at the university of chicago s stagg field researchers headed by enrico fermi achieved the first self sustaining chain reaction in a graphite and uranium pile known as cp using theoretical information garnered from the operation of cp dupont constructed an air cooled experimental production reactor known as x and a pilot chemical separation facility at oak ridge the separation facility using methods developed by glenn t seaborg and a team of researchers at the met lab removed plutonium from uranium irradiated in the x reactor information from cp was also useful to met lab scientists designing the water cooled plutonium production reactors for hanford construction at the site began in mid in november some plutonium trifluoride was reduced to create the first sample of plutonium metal a few micrograms of metallic beads enough plutonium was produced to make it the first synthetically made element to be visible with the unaided eye the nuclear properties of plutonium were also studied researchers found that when it is hit by a neutron it breaks apart fissions by releasing more neutrons and energy these neutrons can hit other atoms of plutonium and so on in an exponentially fast chain reaction this can result in an explosion large enough to destroy a city if enough of the isotope is concentrated to form a critical mass during the early stages of research animals were used to study the effects of radioactive substances on health these studies began in at the university of california at berkeley s radiation laboratory and were conducted by joseph g hamilton hamilton was looking to answer questions about how plutonium would vary in the body depending on exposure mode oral ingestion inhalation absorption through skin retention rates and how plutonium would be fixed in tissues and distributed among the various organs hamilton started administering soluble microgram portions of plutonium compounds to rats using different valence states and different methods of introducing the plutonium oral intravenous etc eventually the lab at chicago also conducted its own plutonium injection experiments using different animals such as mice rabbits fish and even dogs the results of the studies at berkeley and chicago showed that plutonium s physiological behavior differed significantly from that of radium the most alarming result was that there was significant deposition of plutonium in the liver and in the actively metabolizing portion of bone furthermore the rate of plutonium elimination in the excreta differed between species of animals by as much as a factor of five such variation made it extremely difficult to estimate what the rate would be for human beings production during the manhattan project during world war ii the u s government established the manhattan project which was tasked with developing an atomic bomb the three primary research and production sites of the project were the plutonium production facility at what is now the hanford site the uranium enrichment facilities at oak ridge tennessee and the weapons research and design laboratory now known as los alamos national laboratory the first production reactor that made plutonium was the x graphite reactor it went online in and was built at a facility in oak ridge that later became the oak ridge national laboratory in january workers laid the foundations for the first chemical separation building t plant located in west both the t plant and its sister facility in west the u plant were completed by october u plant was used only for training during the manhattan project the separation building in east b plant was completed in february the second facility planned for east was canceled nicknamed queen marys by the workers who built them the separation buildings were awesome canyon like structures feet long feet wide and feet high containing forty process pools the interior had an eerie quality as operators behind seven feet of concrete shielding manipulated remote control equipment by looking through television monitors and periscopes from an upper gallery even with massive concrete lids on the process pools precautions against radiation exposure were necessary and influenced all aspects of plant design on april emilio segr at los alamos received the first sample of reactor produced plutonium from oak ridge within ten days he discovered that reactor bred plutonium had a higher concentration of the isotope plutonium than cyclotron produced plutonium plutonium has a high spontaneous fission rate raising the overall background neutron level of the plutonium sample the original gun type plutonium weapon code named thin man had to be abandoned as a result the increased number of spontaneous neutrons meant that nuclear pre detonation fizzle was likely the entire plutonium weapon design effort at los alamos was soon changed to the more complicated implosion device code named fat man with an implosion weapon plutonium is compressed to a high density with explosive lenses a technically more daunting task than the simple gun type design but necessary to use plutonium for weapons purposes enriched uranium by contrast can be used with either method construction of the hanford b reactor the first industrial sized nuclear reactor for the purposes of material production was completed in march b reactor produced the fissile material for the plutonium weapons used during world war ii b d and f were the initial reactors built at hanford and six additional plutonium producing reactors were built later at the site by the end of january the highly purified plutonium underwent further concentration in the completed chemical isolation building where remaining impurities were removed successfully los alamos received its first plutonium from hanford on february while it was still by no means clear that enough plutonium could be produced for use in bombs by the war s end hanford was by early in operation only two years had passed since col franklin matthias first set up his temporary headquarters on the banks of the columbia river according to kate brown the plutonium production plants at hanford and mayak in russia over a period of four decades both released more than million curies of radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment twice the amount expelled in the chernobyl disaster in each instance most of this radioactive contamination over the years were part of normal operations but unforeseen accidents did occur and plant management kept this secret as the pollution continued unabated in a safe was discovered during excavations of a burial trench at the hanford nuclear site inside the safe were various items including a large glass bottle containing a whitish slurry which was subsequently identified as the oldest sample of weapons grade plutonium known to exist isotope analysis by pacific northwest national laboratory indicated that the plutonium in the bottle was manufactured in the x graphite reactor at oak ridge during trinity and fat man atomic bombs the first atomic bomb test codenamed trinity and detonated on july near alamogordo new mexico used plutonium as its fissile material the implosion design of the gadget as the trinity device was code named used conventional explosive lenses to compress a sphere of plutonium into a supercritical mass which was simultaneously showered with neutrons from the urchin an initiator made of polonium and beryllium neutron source n reaction together these ensured a runaway chain reaction and explosion the overall weapon weighed over tonnes although it used just kg of plutonium in its core about of the plutonium used in the trinity weapon underwent fission resulting in an explosion with an energy equivalent to approximately tons of tnt an identical design was used in the fat man atomic bomb dropped on nagasaki japan on august killing people and destroying of war production at nagasaki only after the announcement of the first atomic bombs was the existence and name of plutonium made known to the public by the manhattan project s smyth report cold war use and waste large stockpiles of weapons grade plutonium were built up by both the soviet union and the united states during the cold war the u s reactors at hanford and the savannah river site in south carolina produced tonnes and an estimated tonnes of military grade plutonium was produced in the ussr each year about tonnes of the element is still produced as a by product of the nuclear power industry as much as tonnes of plutonium may be in storage with more than tonnes of that either inside or extracted from nuclear weapons sipri estimated the world plutonium stockpile in as about tonnes divided equally between weapon and civilian stocks radioactive contamination at the rocky flats plant primarily resulted from two major plutonium fires in and much lower concentrations of radioactive isotopes were released throughout the operational life of the plant from to prevailing winds from the plant carried airborne contamination south and east into populated areas northwest of denver the contamination of the denver area by plutonium from the fires and other sources was not publicly reported until the s according to a study coauthored by edward martell in the more densely populated areas of denver the pu contamination level in surface soils is several times fallout and the plutonium contamination just east of the rocky flats plant ranges up to hundreds of times that from nuclear tests as noted by carl johnson in ambio exposures of a large population in the denver area to plutonium and other radionuclides in the exhaust plumes from the plant date back to weapons production at the rocky flats plant was halted after a combined fbi and epa raid in and years of protests the plant has since been shut down with its buildings demolished and completely removed from the site in the u s some plutonium extracted from dismantled nuclear weapons is melted to form glass logs of plutonium oxide that weigh two tonnes the glass is made of borosilicates mixed with cadmium and gadolinium these logs are planned to be encased in stainless steel and stored as much as km mi underground in bore holes that will be back filled with concrete the u s planned to store plutonium in this way at the yucca mountain nuclear waste repository which is about miles km north east of las vegas nevada on march energy secretary steven chu told a senate hearing the yucca mountain site no longer was viewed as an option for storing reactor waste starting in military generated nuclear waste is being entombed at the waste isolation pilot plant in new mexico in a presidential memorandum dated january president obama established the blue ribbon commission on america s nuclear future in their final report the commission put forth recommendations for developing a comprehensive strategy to pursue including recommendation the united states should undertake an integrated nuclear waste management program that leads to the timely development of one or more permanent deep geological facilities for the safe disposal of spent fuel and high level nuclear waste medical experimentation during and after the end of world war ii scientists working on the manhattan project and other nuclear weapons research projects conducted studies of the effects of plutonium on laboratory animals and human subjects animal studies found that a few milligrams of plutonium per kilogram of tissue is a lethal dose in the case of human subjects this involved injecting solutions containing typically five micrograms of plutonium into hospital patients thought to be either terminally ill or to have a life expectancy of less than ten years either due to age or chronic disease condition this was reduced to one microgram in july after animal studies found that the way plutonium distributed itself in bones was more dangerous than radium most of the subjects eileen welsome says were poor powerless and sick from to eighteen human test subjects were injected with plutonium without informed consent the tests were used to create diagnostic tools to determine the uptake of plutonium in the body in order to develop safety standards for working with plutonium ebb cade was an unwilling participant in medical experiments that involved injection of micrograms of plutonium on april at oak ridge tennessee this experiment was under the supervision of harold hodge other experiments directed by the united states atomic energy commission and the manhattan project continued into the s the plutonium files chronicles the lives of the subjects of the secret program by naming each person involved and discussing the ethical and medical research conducted in secret by the scientists and doctors the episode is now considered to be a serious breach of medical ethics and of the hippocratic oath the government covered up most of these radiation mishaps until when president bill clinton ordered a change of policy and federal agencies then made available relevant records the resulting investigation was undertaken by the president s advisory committee on human radiation experiments and it uncovered much of the material about plutonium research on humans the committee issued a controversial report which said that wrongs were committed but it did not condemn those who perpetrated them applications explosives the isotope plutonium is a key fissile component in nuclear weapons due to its ease of fission and availability encasing the bomb s plutonium pit in a tamper an optional layer of dense material decreases the amount of plutonium needed to reach critical mass by reflecting escaping neutrons back into the plutonium core this reduces the amount of plutonium needed to reach criticality from kg to kg which is a sphere with a diameter of about centimeters in this critical mass is about a third of that for uranium the fat man plutonium bombs used explosive compression of plutonium to obtain significantly higher densities than normal combined with a central neutron source to begin the reaction and increase efficiency thus only kg of plutonium was needed for an explosive yield equivalent to kilotons of tnt hypothetically as little as kg of plutonium and maybe even less could be used to make a single atomic bomb using very sophisticated assembly designs mixed oxide fuel spent nuclear fuel from normal light water reactors contains plutonium but it is a mixture of plutonium and the mixture is not sufficiently enriched for efficient nuclear weapons but can be used once as mox fuel accidental neutron capture causes the amount of plutonium and to grow each time the plutonium is irradiated in a reactor with low speed thermal neutrons so that after the second cycle the plutonium can only be consumed by fast neutron reactors if fast neutron reactors are not available the normal case excess plutonium is usually discarded and forms one of the longest lived components of nuclear waste the desire to consume this plutonium and other transuranic fuels and reduce the radiotoxicity of the waste is the usual reason nuclear engineers give to make fast neutron reactors the most common chemical process purex plutonium uranium extraction reprocesses spent nuclear fuel to extract plutonium and uranium which can be used to form a mixed oxide mox fuel for reuse in nuclear reactors weapons grade plutonium can be added to the fuel mix mox fuel is used in light water reactors and consists of kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel after four years three quarters of the plutonium is burned turned into other elements breeder reactors are specifically designed to create more fissionable material than they consume mox fuel has been in use since the s and is widely used in europe in september the united states and the russian federation signed a plutonium management and disposition agreement by which each agreed to dispose of tonnes of weapons grade plutonium the u s department of energy plans to dispose of tonnes of weapons grade plutonium in the united states before the end of by converting the plutonium to a mox fuel to be used in commercial nuclear power reactors mox fuel improves total burnup a fuel rod is reprocessed after three years of use to remove waste products which by then account for of the total weight of the rods any uranium or plutonium isotopes produced during those three years are left and the rod goes back into production the presence of up to gallium per mass in weapons grade plutonium alloy has the potential to interfere with long term operation of a light water reactor plutonium recovered from spent reactor fuel poses little proliferation hazard because of excessive contamination with non fissile plutonium and plutonium separation of the isotopes is not feasible a dedicated reactor operating on very low burnup hence minimal exposure of newly formed plutonium to additional neutrons which causes it to be transformed to heavier isotopes of plutonium is generally required to produce material suitable for use in efficient nuclear weapons while weapons grade plutonium is defined to contain at least plutonium of the total plutonium the united states have managed to detonate an under kt device using plutonium believed to contain only about plutonium so called fuel grade plutonium the reactor grade plutonium produced by a regular lwr burnup cycle typically contains less than pu with up to parasitic pu pu and fissile pu it is unknown if a device using plutonium obtained from reprocessed civil nuclear waste can be detonated however such a device could hypothetically fizzle and spread radioactive materials over a large urban area the iaea conservatively classifies plutonium of all isotopic vectors as direct use material that is nuclear material that can be used for the manufacture of nuclear explosives components without transmutation or further enrichment power and heat source the isotope plutonium has a half life of years it emits a large amount of thermal energy with low levels of both gamma rays photons and spontaneous neutron rays particles being an alpha emitter it combines high energy radiation with low penetration and thereby requires minimal shielding a sheet of paper can be used to shield against the alpha particles emitted by plutonium one kilogram of the isotope can generate about watts of heat these characteristics make it well suited for electrical power generation for devices that must function without direct maintenance for timescales approximating a human lifetime it is therefore used in radioisotope thermoelectric generators and radioisotope heater units such as those in the cassini voyager galileo and new horizons space probes and the curiosity and perseverance mars mars rovers the twin voyager spacecraft were launched in each containing a watt plutonium power source over years later each source is still producing about watts which allows limited operation of each spacecraft an earlier version of the same technology powered five apollo lunar surface experiment packages starting with apollo in plutonium has also been used successfully to power artificial heart pacemakers to reduce the risk of repeated surgery it has been largely replaced by lithium based primary cells but as of there were somewhere between and plutonium powered pacemakers still implanted and functioning in living patients in the united states by the end of the number of plutonium powered pacemakers was reported to be down to just nine plutonium was studied as a way to provide supplemental heat to scuba diving plutonium mixed with beryllium is used to generate neutrons for research purposes precautions toxicity there are two aspects to the harmful effects of plutonium the radioactivity and the heavy metal poison effects isotopes and compounds of plutonium are radioactive and accumulate in bone marrow contamination by plutonium oxide has resulted from nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents including military nuclear accidents where nuclear weapons have burned studies of the effects of these smaller releases as well as of the widespread radiation poisoning sickness and death following the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki have provided considerable information regarding the dangers symptoms and prognosis of radiation poisoning which in the case of the japanese survivors was largely unrelated to direct plutonium exposure during the decay of plutonium three types of ionizing radiation are released namely alpha beta and gamma either acute or longer term exposure carries a danger of serious health outcomes including radiation sickness genetic damage cancer and death the danger increases with the amount of exposure alpha radiation can travel only a short distance and cannot travel through the outer dead layer of human skin beta radiation can penetrate human skin but cannot go all the way through the body gamma radiation can go all the way through the body even though alpha radiation cannot penetrate the skin ingested or inhaled plutonium does irradiate internal organs alpha particles generated by inhaled plutonium have been found to cause lung cancer in a cohort of european nuclear workers the skeleton where plutonium accumulates and the liver where it collects and becomes concentrated are at risk plutonium is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested only of plutonium oxide is absorbed after ingestion plutonium absorbed by the body is excreted very slowly with a biological half life of years plutonium passes only slowly through cell membranes and intestinal boundaries so absorption by ingestion and incorporation into bone structure proceeds very slowly donald mastick accidentally swallowed a small amount of plutonium iii chloride which was detectable for the next thirty years of his life but appeared to suffer no ill effects plutonium is more dangerous when inhaled than when ingested the risk of lung cancer increases once the total radiation dose equivalent of inhaled plutonium exceeds msv the u s department of energy estimates that the lifetime cancer risk from inhaling plutonium particles each about m wide is over the background u s average ingestion or inhalation of large amounts may cause acute radiation poisoning and possibly death however no human being is known to have died because of inhaling or ingesting plutonium and many people have measurable amounts of plutonium in their bodies the hot particle theory in which a particle of plutonium dust irradiates a localized spot of lung tissue is not supported by mainstream research such particles are more mobile than originally thought and toxicity is not measurably increased due to particulate form when inhaled plutonium can pass into the bloodstream once in the bloodstream plutonium moves throughout the body and into the bones liver or other body organs plutonium that reaches body organs generally stays in the body for decades and continues to expose the surrounding tissue to radiation and thus may cause cancer a commonly cited quote by ralph nader states that a pound of plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere would be enough to kill billion people this was disputed by bernard cohen an opponent of the generally accepted linear no threshold model of radiation toxicity cohen estimated that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than million people by inhalation so that the toxicity of plutonium is roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas several populations of people who have been exposed to plutonium dust e g people living down wind of nevada test sites nagasaki survivors nuclear facility workers and terminally ill patients injected with pu in to study pu metabolism have been carefully followed and analyzed cohen found these studies inconsistent with high estimates of plutonium toxicity citing cases such as albert stevens who survived into old age after being injected with plutonium there were about workers from los alamos national laboratory who inhaled a considerable amount of plutonium dust during s according to the hot particle theory each of them has a chance of being dead from lung cancer by now but there has not been a single lung cancer among them marine toxicity investigating the toxicity of plutonium in humans is just as important as looking at the effects in fauna of marine systems plutonium is known to enter the marine environment by dumping of waste or accidental leakage from nuclear plants although the highest concentrations of plutonium in marine environments are found in the sediments the complex biogeochemical cycle of plutonium means that it is also found in all other compartments for example various zooplankton species that aid in the nutrient cycle will consume the element on a daily basis the complete excretion of ingested plutonium by zooplankton makes their defecation an extremely important mechanism in the scavenging of plutonium from surface waters however those zooplankton that succumb to predation by larger organisms may become a transmission vehicle of plutonium to fish in addition to consumption fish can also be exposed to plutonium by their geographical distribution around the globe one study investigated the effects of transuranium elements plutonium plutonium plutonium on various fish living in the chernobyl exclusion zone cez results showed that a proportion of female perch in the cez displayed either a failure or delay in maturation of the gonads similar studies found large accumulations of plutonium in the respiratory and digestive organs of cod flounder and herring plutonium toxicity is just as detrimental to larvae of fish in nuclear waste areas undeveloped eggs have a higher risk than developed adult fish exposed to the element in these waste areas the oak ridge national laboratory displayed that carp and minnow embryos raised in solutions containing plutonium isotopes did not hatch eggs that hatched displayed significant abnormalities when compared to control developed embryos it revealed that higher concentrations of plutonium have been found to cause issues in marine fauna exposed to the element criticality potential care must be taken to avoid the accumulation of amounts of plutonium which approach critical mass particularly because plutonium s critical mass is only a third of that of uranium a critical mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and gamma rays plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water criticality accidents have occurred in the past some of them with lethal consequences careless handling of tungsten carbide bricks around a kg plutonium sphere resulted in a fatal dose of radiation at los alamos on august when scientist harry daghlian received a dose estimated to be sievert rems and died days later nine months later another los alamos scientist louis slotin died from a similar accident involving a beryllium reflector and the same plutonium core the so called demon core that had previously claimed the life of daghlian in december during a process of purifying plutonium at los alamos a critical mass was formed in a mixing vessel which resulted in the death of a chemical operator named cecil kelley other nuclear accidents have occurred in the soviet union japan the united states and many other countries flammability metallic plutonium is a fire hazard especially if the material is finely divided in a moist environment plutonium forms hydrides on its surface which are pyrophoric and may ignite in air at room temperature plutonium expands up to in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container the radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard magnesium oxide sand is probably the most effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire it cools the burning material acting as a heat sink and also blocks off oxygen special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form generally a dry inert gas atmosphere is required transportation land and sea the usual transportation of plutonium is through the more stable plutonium oxide in a sealed package a typical transport consists of one truck carrying one protected shipping container holding a number of packages with a total weight varying from to kg of plutonium oxide a sea shipment may consist of several containers each of them holding a sealed package the united states nuclear regulatory commission dictates that it must be solid instead of powder if the contents surpass tbq curies of radioactive activity in the ships pacific egret and pacific heron of pacific nuclear transport ltd transported kg lbs of plutonium to a united states government facility in savannah river south carolina air the u s government air transport regulations permit the transport of plutonium by air subject to restrictions on other dangerous materials carried on the same flight packaging requirements and stowage in the rearmost part of the aircraft in media revealed that plutonium has been flown out of norway on commercial passenger airlines around every other year including one time in regulations permit an airplane to transport grams of fissionable material such plutonium transportation is without problems according to a senior advisor seniorr

Americium,Am,americium is a synthetic radioactive chemical element with the symbol am and atomic number it is a transuranic member of the actinide series in the periodic table located under the lanthanide element europium and thus by analogy was named after the americas americium was first produced in by the group of glenn t seaborg from berkeley california at the metallurgical laboratory of the university of chicago as part of the manhattan project although it is the third element in the transuranic series it was discovered fourth after the heavier curium the discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in november most americium is produced by uranium or plutonium being bombarded with neutrons in nuclear reactors one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about grams of americium it is widely used in commercial ionization chamber smoke detectors as well as in neutron sources and industrial gauges several unusual applications such as nuclear batteries or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion have been proposed for the isotope mam but they are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this nuclear isomer americium is a relatively soft radioactive metal with silvery appearance its most common isotopes are am and am in chemical compounds americium usually assumes the oxidation state especially in solutions several other oxidation states are known ranging from to and can be identified by their characteristic optical absorption spectra the crystal lattice of solid americium and its compounds contain small intrinsic radiogenic defects due to metamictization induced by self irradiation with alpha particles which accumulates with time this can cause a drift of some material properties over time more noticeable in older samples history although americium was likely produced in previous nuclear experiments it was first intentionally synthesized isolated and identified in late autumn at the university of california berkeley by glenn t seaborg leon o morgan ralph a james and albert ghiorso they used a inch cyclotron at the university of california berkeley the element was chemically identified at the metallurgical laboratory now argonne national laboratory of the university of chicago following the lighter neptunium plutonium and heavier curium americium was the fourth transuranium element to be discovered at the time the periodic table had been restructured by seaborg to its present layout containing the actinide row below the lanthanide one this led to americium being located right below its twin lanthanide element europium it was thus by analogy named after the americas the name americium after the americas and the symbol am are suggested for the element on the basis of its position as the sixth member of the actinide rare earth series analogous to europium eu of the lanthanide series the new element was isolated from its oxides in a complex multi step process first plutonium nitrate puno solution was coated on a platinum foil of about cm area the solution was evaporated and the residue was converted into plutonium dioxide puo by calcining after cyclotron irradiation the coating was dissolved with nitric acid and then precipitated as the hydroxide using concentrated aqueous ammonia solution the residue was dissolved in perchloric acid further separation was carried out by ion exchange yielding a certain isotope of curium the separation of curium and americium was so painstaking that those elements were initially called by the berkeley group as pandemonium from greek for all demons or hell and delirium from latin for madness initial experiments yielded four americium isotopes am am am and am americium was directly obtained from plutonium upon absorption of two neutrons it decays by

left ce beta ce h cm right the discovery of americium and curium in was closely related to the manhattan project the results were confidential and declassified only in seaborg leaked the synthesis of the elements and on the u s radio show for children quiz kids five days before the official presentation at an american chemical society meeting on november when one of the listeners asked whether any new transuranium element besides plutonium and neptunium had been discovered during the war after the discovery of americium isotopes am and am their production and compounds were patented listing only seaborg as the inventor the initial americium samples weighed a few micrograms they were barely visible and were identified by their radioactivity the first substantial amounts of metallic americium weighing micrograms were not prepared until by reduction of americium iii fluoride with barium metal in high vacuum at c occurrence the longest lived and most common isotopes of americium am and am have half lives of and years respectively therefore any primordial americium americium that was present on earth during its formation should have decayed by now trace amounts of americium probably occur naturally in uranium minerals as a result of nuclear reactions though this has not been confirmed existing americium is concentrated in the areas used for the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests conducted between and as well as at the sites of nuclear incidents such as the chernobyl disaster for example the analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first u s hydrogen bomb ivy mike november enewetak atoll revealed high concentrations of various actinides including americium but due to military secrecy this result was not published until later in trinitite the glassy residue left on the desert floor near alamogordo new mexico after the plutonium based trinity nuclear bomb test on july contains traces of americium elevated levels of americium were also detected at the crash site of a us boeing b bomber aircraft which carried four hydrogen bombs in in greenland in other regions the average radioactivity of surface soil due to residual americium is only about picocuries g mbq g atmospheric americium compounds are poorly soluble in common solvents and mostly adhere to soil particles soil analysis revealed about times higher concentration of americium inside sandy soil particles than in the water present in the soil pores an even higher ratio was measured in loam soils americium is produced mostly artificially in small quantities for research purposes a tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about grams of various americium isotopes mostly am and am their prolonged radioactivity is undesirable for the disposal and therefore americium together with other long lived actinides must be neutralized the associated procedure may involve several steps where americium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short lived nuclides this procedure is well known as nuclear transmutation but it is still being developed for americium the transuranic elements from americium to fermium occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at oklo but no longer do so americium is also one of the elements that have been detected in przybylski s star synthesis and extraction isotope nucleosynthesis americium has been produced in small quantities in nuclear reactors for decades and kilograms of its am and am isotopes have been accumulated by now nevertheless since it was first offered for sale in its price about us per gram us oz of am remains almost unchanged owing to the very complex separation procedure the heavier isotope am is produced in much smaller amounts it is thus more difficult to separate resulting in a higher cost of the order us us per gram us us oz americium is not synthesized directly from uranium the most common reactor material but from the plutonium isotope pu the latter needs to be produced first according to the following nuclear process u n u min np d pu displaystyle ce u ce n gamma u beta ce min np beta ce d pu the capture of two neutrons by pu a so called n reaction followed by a decay results in am pu n pu yr am displaystyle ce pu ce n gamma pu beta ce yr am the plutonium present in spent nuclear fuel contains about of pu because it beta decays to am pu can be extracted and may be used to generate further am however this process is rather slow half of the original amount of pu decays to am after about years and the am amount reaches a maximum after years the obtained am can be used for generating heavier americium isotopes by further neutron capture inside a nuclear reactor in a light water reactor lwr of am converts to am and to its nuclear isomer mam am n am am n am m displaystyle begin cases ce am ce n gamma am ce am ce n gamma m am end cases americium has a half life of only hours which makes its further conversion to am extremely inefficient the latter isotope is produced instead in a process where pu captures four neutrons under high neutron flux pu n pu h am displaystyle ce pu ce n gamma pu beta ce h am metal generation most synthesis routines yield a mixture of different actinide isotopes in oxide forms from which isotopes of americium can be separated in a typical procedure the spent reactor fuel e g mox fuel is dissolved in nitric acid and the bulk of uranium and plutonium is removed using a purex type extraction plutonium uranium extraction with tributyl phosphate in a hydrocarbon the lanthanides and remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue raffinate by a diamide based extraction to give after stripping a mixture of trivalent actinides and lanthanides americium compounds are then selectively extracted using multi step chromatographic and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent a large amount of work has been done on the solvent extraction of americium for example a eu funded project codenamed europart studied triazines and other compounds as potential extraction agents a bis triazinyl bipyridine complex was proposed in as such a reagent is highly selective to americium and curium separation of americium from the highly similar curium can be achieved by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous sodium bicarbonate with ozone at elevated temperatures both am and cm are mostly present in solutions in the valence state whereas curium remains unchanged americium oxidizes to soluble am iv complexes which can be washed away metallic americium is obtained by reduction from its compounds americium iii fluoride was first used for this purpose the reaction was conducted using elemental barium as reducing agent in a water and oxygen free environment inside an apparatus made of tantalum and tungsten a m f b a a m b a f displaystyle mathrm amf ba longrightarrow am baf an alternative is the reduction of americium dioxide by metallic lanthanum or thorium a m o l a a m l a o displaystyle mathrm amo la longrightarrow am la o physical properties in the periodic table americium is located to the right of plutonium to the left of curium and below the lanthanide europium with which it shares many physical and chemical properties americium is a highly radioactive element when freshly prepared it has a silvery white metallic lustre but then slowly tarnishes in air with a density of g cm americium is less dense than both curium g cm and plutonium g cm but has a higher density than europium g cm mostly because of its higher atomic mass americium is relatively soft and easily deformable and has a significantly lower bulk modulus than the actinides before it th pa u np and pu its melting point of c is significantly higher than that of plutonium c and europium c but lower than for curium c at ambient conditions americium is present in its most stable form which has a hexagonal crystal symmetry and a space group p mmc with cell parameters a pm and c pm and four atoms per unit cell the crystal consists of a double hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence abac and so is isotypic with lanthanum and several actinides such as curium the crystal structure of americium changes with pressure and temperature when compressed at room temperature to gpa am transforms to the modification which has a face centered cubic fcc symmetry space group fm m and lattice constant a pm this fcc structure is equivalent to the closest packing with the sequence abc upon further compression to gpa americium transforms to an orthorhombic am structure similar to that of uranium there are no further transitions observed up to gpa except for an appearance of a monoclinic phase at pressures between and gpa there is no consistency on the status of this phase in the literature which also sometimes lists the and phases as i ii and iii the transition is accompanied by a decrease in the crystal volume although theory also predicts a significant volume change for the transition it is not observed experimentally the pressure of the transition decreases with increasing temperature and when americium is heated at ambient pressure at c it changes into an fcc phase which is different from am and at c it converts to a body centered cubic structure the pressure temperature phase diagram of americium is thus rather similar to those of lanthanum praseodymium and neodymium as with many other actinides self damage of the crystal structure due to alpha particle irradiation is intrinsic to americium it is especially noticeable at low temperatures where the mobility of the produced structure defects is relatively low by broadening of x ray diffraction peaks this effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of americium and some of its properties such as electrical resistivity so for americium the resistivity at k increases with time from about ohm cm to ohm cm after hours and saturates at about ohm cm after hours this effect is less pronounced at room temperature due to annihilation of radiation defects also heating to room temperature the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity in fresh samples the resistivity gradually increases with temperature from about ohm cm at liquid helium to ohm cm at room temperature this behavior is similar to that of neptunium uranium thorium and protactinium but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to k followed by saturation the room temperature value for americium is lower than that of neptunium plutonium and curium but higher than for uranium thorium and protactinium americium is paramagnetic in a wide temperature range from that of liquid helium to room temperature and above this behavior is markedly different from that of its neighbor curium which exhibits antiferromagnetic transition at k the thermal expansion coefficient of americium is slightly anisotropic and amounts to c along the shorter a axis and c for the longer c hexagonal axis the enthalpy of dissolution of americium metal in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is kj mol from which the standard enthalpy change of formation fh of aqueous am ion is kj mol the standard potential am am is v chemical properties americium metal readily reacts with oxygen and dissolves in aqueous acids the most stable oxidation state for americium is the chemistry of americium iii has many similarities to the chemistry of lanthanide iii compounds for example trivalent americium forms insoluble fluoride oxalate iodate hydroxide phosphate and other salts compounds of americium in oxidation states and have also been studied this is the widest range that has been observed with actinide elements the color of americium compounds in aqueous solution is as follows am yellow reddish am yellow reddish amvo yellow amvio brown and amviio dark green the absorption spectra have sharp peaks due to f f transitions in the visible and near infrared regions typically am iii has absorption maxima at ca and nm am v at ca and nm and am vi at ca and nm americium compounds with oxidation state and higher are strong oxidizing agents comparable in strength to the permanganate ion mno in acidic solutions whereas the am ions are unstable in solutions and readily convert to am compounds such as americium dioxide amo and americium iv fluoride amf are stable in the solid state the pentavalent oxidation state of americium was first observed in in acidic aqueous solution the amo ion is unstable with respect to disproportionation the reaction amo h amo am h ois typical the chemistry of am v and am vi is comparable to the chemistry of uranium in those oxidation states in particular compounds like li amo and li amo are comparable to uranates and the ion amo is comparable to the uranyl ion uo such compounds can be prepared by oxidation of am iii in dilute nitric acid with ammonium persulfate other oxidising agents that have been used include silver i oxide ozone and sodium persulfate chemical compounds oxygen compounds three americium oxides are known with the oxidation states amo am o and amo americium ii oxide was prepared in minute amounts and has not been characterized in detail americium iii oxide is a red brown solid with a melting point of c americium iv oxide is the main form of solid americium which is used in nearly all its applications as most other actinide dioxides it is a black solid with a cubic fluorite crystal structure the oxalate of americium iii vacuum dried at room temperature has the chemical formula am c o h o upon heating in vacuum it loses water at c and starts decomposing into amo at c the decomposition completes at about c the initial oxalate dissolves in nitric acid with the maximum solubility of g l halides halides of americium are known for the oxidation states and where the is most stable especially in solutions reduction of am iii compounds with sodium amalgam yields am ii salts the black halides amcl ambr and ami they are very sensitive to oxygen and oxidize in water releasing hydrogen and converting back to the am iii state specific lattice constants are orthorhombic amcl a pm b pm and c pm tetragonal ambr a pm and c pm they can also be prepared by reacting metallic americium with an appropriate mercury halide hgx where x cl br or i am hgx mercury halide c amx hg displaystyle ce am underset mercury halide hgx atop circ ce c amx hg americium iii fluoride amf is poorly soluble and precipitates upon reaction of am and fluoride ions in weak acidic solutions am f amf displaystyle ce am f amf v the tetravalent americium iv fluoride amf is obtained by reacting solid americium iii fluoride with molecular fluorine amf f amf displaystyle ce amf f amf another known form of solid tetravalent americium fluoride is kamf tetravalent americium has also been observed in the aqueous phase for this purpose black am oh was dissolved in m nh f with the americium concentration of m the resulting reddish solution had a characteristic optical absorption spectrum which is similar to that of amf but differed from other oxidation states of americium heating the am iv solution to c did not result in its disproportionation or reduction however a slow reduction was observed to am iii and assigned to self irradiation of americium by alpha particles most americium iii halides form hexagonal crystals with slight variation of the color and exact structure between the halogens so chloride amcl is reddish and has a structure isotypic to uranium iii chloride space group p m and the melting point of c the fluoride is isotypic to laf space group p mmc and the iodide to bii space group r the bromide is an exception with the orthorhombic pubr type structure and space group cmcm crystals of americium hexahydrate amcl h o can be prepared by dissolving americium dioxide in hydrochloric acid and evaporating the liquid those crystals are hygroscopic and have yellow reddish color and a monoclinic crystal structure oxyhalides of americium in the form amvio x amvo x amivox and amiiiox can be obtained by reacting the corresponding americium halide with oxygen or sb o and amocl can also be produced by vapor phase hydrolysis amcl h o amocl hcl chalcogenides and pnictides the known chalcogenides of americium include the sulfide ams selenides amse and am se and tellurides am te and amte the pnictides of americium am of the amx type are known for the elements phosphorus arsenic antimony and bismuth they crystallize in the rock salt lattice silicides and borides americium monosilicide amsi and disilicide nominally amsix with x were obtained by reduction of americium iii fluoride with elementary silicon in vacuum at c amsi and c amsix amsi is a black solid isomorphic with lasi it has an orthorhombic crystal symmetry amsix has a bright silvery lustre and a tetragonal crystal lattice space group i amd it is isomorphic with pusi and thsi borides of americium include amb and amb the tetraboride can be obtained by heating an oxide or halide of americium with magnesium diboride in vacuum or inert atmosphere organoamericium compounds analogous to uranocene americium forms the organometallic compound amerocene with two cyclooctatetraene ligands with the chemical formula c h am a cyclopentadienyl complex is also known that is likely to be stoichiometrically amcp formation of the complexes of the type am n c h btp where btp stands for di triazin yl pyridine in solutions containing n c h btp and am ions has been confirmed by exafs some of these btp type complexes selectively interact with americium and therefore are useful in its selective separation from lanthanides and another actinides biological aspects americium is an artificial element of recent origin and thus does not have a biological requirement it is harmful to life it has been proposed to use bacteria for removal of americium and other heavy metals from rivers and streams thus enterobacteriaceae of the genus citrobacter precipitate americium ions from aqueous solutions binding them into a metal phosphate complex at their cell walls several studies have been reported on the biosorption and bioaccumulation of americium by bacteria and fungi fission the isotope mam half life years has the largest cross sections for absorption of thermal neutrons barns that results in a small critical mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction the critical mass for a bare mam sphere is about kg the uncertainty results from insufficient knowledge of its material properties it can be lowered to kg with a metal reflector and should become even smaller with a water reflector such small critical mass is favorable for portable nuclear weapons but those based on mam are not known yet probably because of its scarcity and high price the critical masses of two other readily available isotopes am and am are relatively high to kg for am and kg for am scarcity and high price yet hinder application of americium as a nuclear fuel in nuclear reactors there are proposals of very compact kw high flux reactors using as little as grams of mam such low power reactors would be relatively safe to use as neutron sources for radiation therapy in hospitals isotopes about isotopes and nuclear isomers are known for americium there are two long lived alpha emitters am has a half life of years and is the most stable isotope and am has a half life of years the most stable nuclear isomer is m am it has a long half life of years the half lives of other isotopes and isomers range from microseconds for m am to hours for am as with most other actinides the isotopes of americium with odd number of neutrons have relatively high rate of nuclear fission and low critical mass americium decays to np emitting alpha particles of different energies mostly at mev and mev because many of the resulting states are metastable they also emit gamma rays with the discrete energies between and kev americium is a short lived isotope with a half life of h it mostly converts by decay to cm but also by electron capture to pu both cm and pu transform via nearly the same decay chain through pu down to u nearly all of m am decays by internal conversion to am and the remaining by decay to np the latter subsequently decays to pu and then to u americium transforms by emission into np which converts by decay to pu and the pu changes into u by emitting an particle applications ionization type smoke detector americium is used in the most common type of household smoke detector which uses am in the form of americium dioxide as its source of ionizing radiation this isotope is preferred over ra because it emits times more alpha particles and relatively little harmful gamma radiation the amount of americium in a typical new smoke detector is microcurie kbq or microgram this amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium a different transuranic element with a much longer half life about million years with its half life of years the americium in a smoke detector includes about neptunium after years and about after years the radiation passes through an ionization chamber an air filled space between two electrodes and permits a small constant current between the electrodes any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles which reduces the ionization and affects this current triggering the alarm compared to the alternative optical smoke detector the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which are too small to produce significant light scattering however it is more prone to false alarms radionuclide as am has a roughly similar half life to pu years vs years it has been proposed as an active element of radioisotope thermoelectric generators for example in spacecraft although americium produces less heat and electricity the power yield is mw g for am and mw g for am cf mw g for pu and its radiation poses more threat to humans owing to neutron emission the european space agency is considering using americium for its space probes another proposed space related application of americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion it relies on the very high rate of nuclear fission of mam which can be maintained even in a micrometer thick foil small thickness avoids the problem of self absorption of emitted radiation this problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods in which only surface layers provide alpha particles the fission products of mam can either directly propel the spaceship or they can heat a thrusting gas they can also transfer their energy to a fluid and generate electricity through a magnetohydrodynamic generator one more proposal which utilizes the high nuclear fission rate of mam is a nuclear battery its design relies not on the energy of the emitted by americium alpha particles but on their charge that is the americium acts as the self sustaining cathode a single kg mam charge of such battery could provide about kw of power over a period of days even with all the potential benefits the current applications of mam are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this particular nuclear isomer in researchers at the uk national nuclear laboratory and the university of leicester demonstrated the use of heat generated by americium to illuminate a small light bulb this technology could lead to systems to power missions with durations up to years into interstellar space where solar panels do not function neutron source the oxide of am pressed with beryllium is an efficient neutron source here americium acts as the alpha source and beryllium produces neutrons owing to its large cross section for the n nuclear reaction am np he displaystyle ce am np he gamma be he c n displaystyle ce be he c n gamma the most widespread use of ambe neutron sources is a neutron probe a device used to measure the quantity of water present in soil as well as moisture density for quality control in highway construction am neutron sources are also used in well logging applications as well as in neutron radiography tomography and other radiochemical investigations production of other elements americium is a starting material for the production of other transuranic elements and transactinides for example of am decays to cm and to pu in the nuclear reactor am is also up converted by neutron capture to am and am which transforms by decay to cm am n am h cm displaystyle ce am ce n gamma am beta ce h cm irradiation of am by c or ne ions yields the isotopes es einsteinium or db dubnium respectively furthermore the element berkelium bk isotope had been first intentionally produced and identified by bombarding am with alpha particles in by the same berkeley group using the same inch cyclotron similarly nobelium was produced at the joint institute for nuclear research dubna russia in in several reactions one of which included irradiation of am with n ions besides one of the synthesis reactions for lawrencium discovered by scientists at berkeley and dubna included bombardment of am with o spectrometer americium has been used as a portable source of both gamma rays and alpha particles for a number of medical and industrial uses the kev gamma ray emissions from am in such sources can be used for indirect analysis of materials in radiography and x ray fluorescence spectroscopy as well as for quality control in fixed nuclear density gauges and nuclear densometers for example the element has been employed to gauge glass thickness to help create flat glass americium is also suitable for calibration of gamma ray spectrometers in the low energy range since its spectrum consists of nearly a single peak and negligible compton continuum at least three orders of magnitude lower intensity americium gamma rays were also used to provide passive diagnosis of thyroid function this medical application is however obsolete health concerns as a highly radioactive element americium and its compounds must be handled only in an appropriate laboratory under special arrangements although most americium isotopes predominantly emit alpha particles which can be blocked by thin layers of common materials many of the daughter products emit gamma rays and neutrons which have a long penetration depth if consumed most of the americium is excreted within a few days with only absorbed in the blood of which roughly goes to the liver and to the bones and the remaining is excreted the uptake to the liver depends on the individual and increases with age in the bones americium is first deposited over cortical and trabecular surfaces and slowly redistributes over the bone with time the biological half life of am is years in the bones and years in the liver whereas in the gonads testicles and ovaries it remains permanently in all these organs americium promotes formation of cancer cells as a result of its radioactivity americium often enters landfills from discarded smoke detectors the rules associated with the disposal of smoke detectors are relaxed in most jurisdictions in year old david hahn extracted the americium from about smoke detectors in an attempt to build a breeder nuclear reactor there have been a few cases of exposure to americium the worst case being that of chemical operations technician harold mccluskey who at the age of was exposed to times the occupational standard for americium as a result of an explosion in his lab mccluskey died at the age of of unrelated pre existing disease ,95
Curium,Cm,curium is a transuranic radioactive chemical element with the symbol cm and atomic number this actinide element was named after eminent scientists marie and pierre curie both known for their research on radioactivity curium was first intentionally made by the team of glenn t seaborg ralph a james and albert ghiorso in using the cyclotron at berkeley they bombarded the newly discovered element plutonium the isotope pu with alpha particles this was then sent to the metallurgical laboratory at university of chicago where a tiny sample of curium was eventually separated and identified the discovery was kept secret until after the end of world war ii the news was released to the public in november most curium is produced by bombarding uranium or plutonium with neutrons in nuclear reactors one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains grams of curium curium is a hard dense silvery metal with a high melting and boiling point for an actinide it is paramagnetic at ambient conditions but becomes antiferromagnetic upon cooling and other magnetic transitions are also seen in many curium compounds in compounds curium usually has valence and sometimes the valence is predominant in solutions curium readily oxidizes and its oxides are a dominant form of this element it forms strongly fluorescent complexes with various organic compounds but there is no evidence of its incorporation into bacteria and archaea if it gets into the human body curium accumulates in bones lungs and liver where it promotes cancer all known isotopes of curium are radioactive and have small critical mass for a nuclear chain reaction they mostly emit particles radioisotope thermoelectric generators can use the heat from this process but this is hindered by the rarity and high cost of curium curium is used in making heavier actinides and the pu radionuclide for power sources in cardiac pacemakers and rtgs for spacecraft it served as the source in the alpha particle x ray spectrometers of several space probes including the sojourner spirit opportunity and curiosity mars rovers and the philae lander on comet p churyumov gerasimenko to analyze the composition and structure of the surface history though curium had likely been produced in previous nuclear experiments as well as the natural nuclear fission reactor at oklo gabon it was first intentionally synthesized isolated and identified in at university of california berkeley by glenn t seaborg ralph a james and albert ghiorso in their experiments they used a inch cm cyclotron curium was chemically identified at the metallurgical laboratory now argonne national laboratory university of chicago it was the third transuranium element to be discovered even though it is the fourth in the series the lighter element americium was still unknown the sample was prepared as follows first plutonium nitrate solution was coated on a platinum foil of cm area the solution was evaporated and the residue was converted into plutonium iv oxide puo by annealing following cyclotron irradiation of the oxide the coating was dissolved with nitric acid and then precipitated as the hydroxide using concentrated aqueous ammonia solution the residue was dissolved in perchloric acid and further separation was done by ion exchange to yield a certain isotope of curium the separation of curium and americium was so painstaking that the berkeley group initially called those elements pandemonium from greek for all demons or hell and delirium from latin for madness curium was made in july august by bombarding pu with particles to produce curium with the release of a neutron pu he cm n displaystyle ce pu he cm n curium was unambiguously identified by the characteristic energy of the particles emitted during the decay cm pu he displaystyle ce cm pu he the half life of this alpha decay was first measured as days and then corrected to days another isotope cm was produced in a similar reaction in march pu he cm n displaystyle ce pu he cm n the decay half life of cm was correctly determined as days the discovery of curium and americium in was closely related to the manhattan project so the results were confidential and declassified only in seaborg leaked the synthesis of the elements and on the u s radio show for children the quiz kids five days before the official presentation at an american chemical society meeting on november when one listener asked if any new transuranic element beside plutonium and neptunium had been discovered during the war the discovery of curium cm and cm its production and its compounds was later patented listing only seaborg as the inventor the element was named after marie curie and her husband pierre curie who are known for discovering radium and for their work in radioactivity it followed the example of gadolinium a lanthanide element above curium in the periodic table which was named after the explorer of rare earth elements johan gadolin as the name for the element of atomic number we should like to propose curium with symbol cm the evidence indicates that element contains seven f electrons and is thus analogous to the element gadolinium with its seven f electrons in the regular rare earth series on this basis element is named after the curies in a manner analogous to the naming of gadolinium in which the chemist gadolin was honored the first curium samples were barely visible and were identified by their radioactivity louis werner and isadore perlman made the first substantial sample of g curium hydroxide at university of california berkeley in by bombarding americium with neutrons macroscopic amounts of curium iii fluoride were obtained in by w w t crane j c wallmann and b b cunningham its magnetic susceptibility was very close to that of gdf providing the first experimental evidence for the valence of curium in its compounds curium metal was produced only in by reduction of cmf with barium characteristics physical a synthetic radioactive element curium is a hard dense metal with a silvery white appearance and physical and chemical properties resembling gadolinium its melting point of c is significantly higher than that of the previous elements neptunium c plutonium c and americium c in comparison gadolinium melts at c curium boils at is c with a density of g cm curium is lighter than neptunium g cm and plutonium g cm but heavier than most other metals of two crystalline forms of curium cm is more stable at ambient conditions it has a hexagonal symmetry space group p mmc lattice parameters a pm and c pm and four formula units per unit cell the crystal consists of double hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence abac and so is isotypic with lanthanum at pressure gpa at room temperature cm becomes cm which has face centered cubic symmetry space group fm m and lattice constant a pm on further compression to gpa curium becomes an orthorhombic cm structure similar to uranium with no further transitions observed up to gpa these three curium phases are also called cm i ii and iii curium has peculiar magnetic properties its neighbor element americium shows no deviation from curie weiss paramagnetism in the entire temperature range but cm transforms to an antiferromagnetic state upon cooling to k and cm exhibits a ferrimagnetic transition at k curium pnictides show ferromagnetic transitions upon cooling cmn and cmas at k cmp at k and cmsb at k the lanthanide analog of curium gadolinium and its pnictides also show magnetic transitions upon cooling but the transition character is somewhat different gd and gdn become ferromagnetic and gdp gdas and gdsb show antiferromagnetic ordering in accordance with magnetic data electrical resistivity of curium increases with temperature about twice between and k and then is nearly constant up to room temperature there is a significant increase in resistivity over time cm h due to self damage of the crystal lattice by alpha decay this makes uncertain the true resistivity of curium cm curium s resistivity is similar to that of gadolinium and the actinides plutonium and neptunium but significantly higher than that of americium uranium polonium and thorium under ultraviolet illumination curium iii ions show strong and stable yellow orange fluorescence with a maximum in the range nm depending on their environment the fluorescence originates from the transitions from the first excited state d and the ground state s analysis of this fluorescence allows monitoring interactions between cm iii ions in organic and inorganic complexes chemical curium ion in solution almost always has a oxidation state the most stable oxidation state for curium a oxidation state is seen mainly in a few solid phases such as cmo and cmf aqueous curium iv is only known in the presence of strong oxidizers such as potassium persulfate and is easily reduced to curium iii by radiolysis and even by water itself chemical behavior of curium is different from the actinides thorium and uranium and is similar to americium and many lanthanides in aqueous solution the cm ion is colorless to pale green cm ion is pale yellow the optical absorption of cm ion contains three sharp peaks at and nm and their strength can be directly converted into the concentration of the ions oxidation state has only been reported once in solution in as the curyl ion cmo this was prepared from beta decay of americium in the americium v ion amo failure to get cm vi from oxidation of cm iii and cm iv may be due to the high cm cm ionization potential and the instability of cm v curium ions are hard lewis acids and thus form most stable complexes with hard bases the bonding is mostly ionic with a small covalent component curium in its complexes commonly exhibits a fold coordination environment within a tricapped trigonal prismatic geometry isotopes about radioisotopes and nuclear isomers cm to cm are known none are stable the longest half lives are million years cm and years cm other long lived ones are cm years cm years and cm years curium is unusual it mostly decays by spontaneous fission the most commonly used isotopes are cm and cm with the half lives days and years respectively all isotopes cm cm and cm undergo a self sustaining nuclear chain reaction and thus in principle can be a nuclear fuel in a reactor as in most transuranic elements nuclear fission cross section is especially high for the odd mass curium isotopes cm cm and cm these can be used in thermal neutron reactors whereas a mixture of curium isotopes is only suitable for fast breeder reactors since the even mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as burn up increases the mixed oxide mox fuel which is to be used in power reactors should contain little or no curium because neutron activation of cm will create californium californium is a strong neutron emitter and would pollute the back end of the fuel cycle and increase the dose to reactor personnel hence if minor actinides are to be used as fuel in a thermal neutron reactor the curium should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special fuel rods where it is the only actinide present the adjacent table lists the critical masses for curium isotopes for a sphere without moderator or reflector with a metal reflector cm of steel the critical masses of the odd isotopes are about kg when using water thickness cm as the reflector the critical mass can be as small as gram for cm gram for cm and gram for cm there is significant uncertainty in these critical mass values while it is usually on the order of the values for cm and cm were listed as large as kg and kg respectively by some research groups curium is not currently used as nuclear fuel due to its low availability and high price cm and cm have very small critical mass and so could be used in tactical nuclear weapons but none are known to have been made curium is not suitable for such due to its short half life and strong emission which would cause excessive heat curium would be highly suitable due to its long half life which is times longer than plutonium used in many existing nuclear weapons occurrence the longest lived isotope cm has half life million years so any primordial curium that is present on earth when it formed should have decayed by now its past presence as an extinct radionuclide is detectable as an excess of its primordial long lived daughter u traces of curium may occur naturally in uranium minerals due to neutron capture and beta decay though this has not been confirmed traces of cm are also probably brought to earth in cosmic rays but again this has not been confirmed curium is made artificially in small amounts for research purposes it also occurs as one of the waste products in spent nuclear fuel curium is present in nature in some areas used for nuclear weapons testing analysis of the debris at the test site of the united states first thermonuclear weapon ivy mike november enewetak atoll besides einsteinium fermium plutonium and americium also revealed isotopes of berkelium californium and curium in particular cm cm and smaller quantities of cm cm and cm atmospheric curium compounds are poorly soluble in common solvents and mostly adhere to soil particles soil analysis revealed about times higher concentration of curium at the sandy soil particles than in water present in the soil pores an even higher ratio of about was measured in loam soils the transuranium elements from americium to fermium including curium occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at oklo but no longer do so curium and other non primordial actinides have also been detected in the spectrum of przybylski s star synthesis isotope preparation curium is made in small amounts in nuclear reactors and by now only kilograms of cm and cm have been accumulated and grams or even milligrams for heavier isotopes hence the high price of curium which has been quoted at usd per milligram with a more recent estimate at us g for cm and us g for cm in nuclear reactors curium is formed from u in a series of nuclear reactions in the first chain u captures a neutron and converts into u which via decay transforms into np and pu further neutron capture followed by decay gives americium am which further becomes cm for research purposes curium is obtained by irradiating not uranium but plutonium which is available in large amounts from spent nuclear fuel a much higher neutron flux is used for the irradiation that results in a different reaction chain and formation of cm curium alpha decays to pu but it also absorbs neutrons hence a small amount of heavier curium isotopes of those cm and cm are popular in scientific research due to their long half lives but the production rate of cm in thermal neutron reactors is low because it is prone to fission due to thermal neutrons synthesis of cm by neutron capture is unlikely due to the short half life of the intermediate cm min which decays to the berkelium isotope bk the above cascade of n reactions gives a mix of different curium isotopes their post synthesis separation is cumbersome so a selective synthesis is desired curium is favored for research purposes due to its long half life the most efficient way to prepare this isotope is by decay of the californium isotope cf which is available in relatively large amounts due to its long half life years about mg of cm is produced thus per year the associated reaction produces cm with isotopic purity of another isotope cm can be obtained for research from decay of cf the latter isotope is produced in small amounts from decay of bk metal preparation most synthesis routines yield a mix of actinide isotopes as oxides from which a given isotope of curium needs to be separated an example procedure could be to dissolve spent reactor fuel e g mox fuel in nitric acid and remove the bulk of the uranium and plutonium using a purex plutonium uranium extraction type extraction with tributyl phosphate in a hydrocarbon the lanthanides and the remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue raffinate by a diamide based extraction to give after stripping a mixture of trivalent actinides and lanthanides a curium compound is then selectively extracted using multi step chromatographic and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent bis triazinyl bipyridine complex has been recently proposed as such reagent which is highly selective to curium separation of curium from the very chemically similar americium can also be done by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous sodium bicarbonate with ozone at elevated temperature both americium and curium are present in solutions mostly in the valence state americium oxidizes to soluble am iv complexes but curium stays unchanged and so can be isolated by repeated centrifugation metallic curium is obtained by reduction of its compounds initially curium iii fluoride was used for this purpose the reaction was done in an environment free of water and oxygen in an apparatus made of tantalum and tungsten using elemental barium or lithium as reducing agents c m f l i c m l i f displaystyle mathrm cmf li longrightarrow cm lif another possibility is reduction of curium iv oxide using a magnesium

one of two known examples of the very rare state for curium another observed species was reported to behave similar to a supposed plutonium tetroxide and was tentatively characterized as cmo with curium in the extremely rare state but new experiments seem to indicate that cmo does not exist and have cast doubt on the existence of puo as well halides the colorless curium iii fluoride cmf can be

cmocl hcl chalcogenides and pnictides sulfides selenides and tellurides of curium have been obtained by treating curium with gaseous sulfur selenium or tellurium in vacuum at elevated temperature curium pnictides of the type cmx are known for nitrogen phosphorus arsenic and antimony they can be prepared by reacting either curium iii hydride cmh or metallic curium with these elements at elevated temperature organocurium compounds and biological aspects organometallic complexes analogous to uranocene are known also for other actinides such as thorium protactinium neptunium plutonium and americium molecular orbital theory predicts a stable curocene complex c h cm but it has not been reported experimentally yet formation of the complexes of the type cm n c h btp btp di triazin yl pyridine in solutions containing n c h btp and cm ions has been confirmed by exafs some of these btp type complexes selectively interact with curium and thus are useful for separating it from lanthanides and another actinides dissolved cm ions bind with many organic compounds such as hydroxamic acid urea fluorescein and adenosine triphosphate many of these compounds are related to biological activity of various microorganisms the resulting complexes show strong yellow orange emission under uv light excitation which is convenient not only for their detection but also for studying interactions between the cm ion and the ligands via changes in the half life of the order ms and spectrum of the fluorescence curium has no biological significance there are a few reports on biosorption of cm by bacteria and archaea but no evidence for incorporation of curium into them applications radionuclides curium is one of the most radioactive isolable elements its two most common isotopes cm and cm are strong alpha emitters energy mev they have fairly short half lives days and years and give as much as w g and w g of heat respectively therefore curium can be used in its common oxide form in radioisotope thermoelectric generators like those in spacecraft this application has been studied for the cm isotope while cm was abandoned due to its prohibitive price around usd g cm with a year half life and good energy yield of w g could be a suitable fuel but it gives significant amounts of harmful gamma and beta rays from radioactive decay products as an emitter cm needs much less radiation shielding but it has a high spontaneous fission rate and thus a lot of neutron and gamma radiation compared to a competing thermoelectric generator isotope such as pu cm emits times more neutrons and its higher gamma emission requires a shield that is times thicker inches mm of lead for a kw source compared to inches mm for pu therefore this use of curium is currently considered impractical a more promising use of cm is for making pu a better radioisotope for thermoelectric generators such as in heart pacemakers the alternate routes to pu use the n reaction of np or deuteron bombardment of uranium though both reactions always produce pu as an undesired by product since the latter decays to u with strong gamma emission curium is a common starting material for making higher transuranic and superheavy elements thus bombarding cm with neon ne magnesium mg or calcium ca yields isotopes of seaborgium sg hassium hs and hs and livermorium lv lv and possibly lv californium was discovered when a microgram sized target of curium was irradiated with mev alpha particles using the inch cm cyclotron at berkeley cm he cf nonly about atoms of californium were produced in this experiment the odd mass curium isotopes cm cm and cm are all highly fissile and can release additional energy in a thermal spectrum nuclear reactor all curium isotopes are fissionable in fast neutron reactors this is one of the motives for minor actinide separation and transmutation in the nuclear fuel cycle helping to reduce the long term radiotoxicity of used or spent nuclear fuel x ray spectrometer the most practical application of cm though rather limited in total volume is as particle source in alpha particle x ray spectrometers apxs these instruments were installed on the sojourner mars mars mars exploration rovers and philae comet lander as well as the mars science laboratory to analyze the composition and structure of the rocks on the surface of planet mars apxs was also used in the surveyor moon probes but with a cm source an elaborate apxs setup has a sensor head containing six curium sources with a total decay rate of several tens of millicuries roughly one gigabecquerel the sources are collimated on a sample and the energy spectra of the alpha particles and protons scattered from the sample are analyzed proton analysis is done only in some spectrometers these spectra contain quantitative information on all major elements in the sample except for hydrogen helium and lithium safety due to its radioactivity curium and its compounds must be handled in appropriate labs under special arrangements while curium itself mostly emits particles which are absorbed by thin layers of common materials some of its decay products emit significant fractions of beta and gamma rays which require a more elaborate protection if consumed curium is excreted within a few days and only is absorbed in the blood from there goes to the liver to the bones and the remaining is excreted in bone curium accumulates on the inside of the interfaces to the bone marrow and does not significantly redistribute with time its radiation destroys bone marrow and thus stops red blood cell creation the biological half life of curium is about years in the liver and years in the bones curium is absorbed in the body much more strongly via inhalation and the allowed total dose of cm in soluble form is ci intravenous injection of cm and cm containing solutions to rats increased the incidence of bone tumor and inhalation promoted lung and liver cancer curium isotopes are inevitably present in spent nuclear fuel about g tonne the isotopes cm cm have decay times of thousands of years and must be removed to neutralize the fuel for disposal such a procedure involves several steps where curium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short lived nuclides this procedure nuclear transmutation while well documented for other elements is still being developed for curium ,96
Berkelium,Bk,berkelium is a transuranic radioactive chemical element with the symbol bk and atomic number it is a member of the actinide and transuranium element series it is named after the city of berkeley california the location of the lawrence berkeley national laboratory then the university of california radiation laboratory where it was discovered in december berkelium was the fifth transuranium element discovered after neptunium plutonium curium and americium the major isotope of berkelium bk is synthesized in minute quantities in dedicated high flux nuclear reactors mainly at the oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee united states and at the research institute of atomic reactors in dimitrovgrad russia the production of the second most important isotope bk involves the irradiation of the rare isotope cm with high energy alpha particles just over one gram of berkelium has been produced in the united states since there is no practical application of berkelium outside scientific research which is mostly directed at the synthesis of heavier transuranium elements and superheavy elements a milligram batch of berkelium was prepared during a day irradiation period and then purified for a further days at oak ridge in this sample was used to synthesize the new element tennessine for the first time in at the joint institute for nuclear research russia after it was bombarded with calcium ions for days this was the culmination of the russia us collaboration on the synthesis of the heaviest elements on the periodic table berkelium is a soft silvery white radioactive metal the berkelium isotope emits low energy electrons and thus is relatively safe to handle it decays with a half life of days to californium which is a strong emitter of ionizing alpha particles this gradual transformation is an important consideration when studying the properties of elemental berkelium and its chemical compounds since the formation of californium brings not only chemical contamination but also free radical effects and self heating from the emitted alpha particles characteristics physical berkelium is a soft silvery white radioactive actinide metal in the periodic table it is located to the right of the actinide curium to the left of the actinide californium and below the lanthanide terbium with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties its density of g cm lies between those of curium g cm and californium g cm as does its melting point of c below that of curium c but higher than that of californium c berkelium is relatively soft and has one of the lowest bulk moduli among the actinides at about gpa pa berkelium iii ions shows two sharp fluorescence peaks at nanometers red light and nanometers deep red near infrared due to internal transitions at the f electron shell the relative intensity of these peaks depends on the excitation power and temperature of the sample this emission can be observed for example after dispersing berkelium ions in a silicate glass by melting the glass in presence of berkelium oxide or halide between k and room temperature berkelium behaves as a curie weiss paramagnetic material with an effective magnetic moment of bohr magnetons b and a curie temperature of k this magnetic moment is almost equal to the theoretical value of b calculated within the simple atomic l s coupling model upon cooling to about k berkelium undergoes a transition to an antiferromagnetic state enthalpy of dissolution in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is kj mol from which the standard enthalpy of formation fh of aqueous bk ions is obtained as kj mol the standard electrode potential bk bk is v the ionization potential of a neutral berkelium atom is ev allotropes at ambient conditions berkelium assumes its most stable form which has a hexagonal symmetry space group p mmc lattice parameters of pm and pm the crystal has a double hexagonal close packing structure with the layer sequence abac and so is isotypic having a similar structure with lanthanum and forms of actinides beyond curium this crystal structure changes with pressure and temperature when compressed at room temperature to gpa berkelium transforms to the modification which has a face centered cubic fcc symmetry and space group fm m this transition occurs without change in volume but the enthalpy increases by kj mol upon further compression to gpa berkelium transforms to an orthorhombic berkelium structure similar to that of uranium this transition is accompanied by a volume decrease and delocalization of the electrons at the f electron shell no further phase transitions are observed up to gpa upon heating berkelium transforms into another phase with an fcc lattice but slightly different from berkelium space group fm m and the lattice constant of pm this fcc structure is equivalent to the closest packing with the sequence abc this phase is metastable and will gradually revert to the original berkelium phase at room temperature the temperature of the phase transition is believed to be quite close to the melting point chemical like all actinides berkelium dissolves in various aqueous inorganic acids liberating gaseous hydrogen and converting into the berkelium iii state this trivalent oxidation state is the most stable especially in aqueous solutions but tetravalent pentavalent and possibly divalent berkelium compounds are also known the existence of divalent berkelium salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed lanthanum iii chloride strontium chloride melts a similar behavior is observed for the lanthanide analogue of berkelium terbium aqueous solutions of bk ions are green in most acids the color of bk ions is yellow in hydrochloric acid and orange yellow in sulfuric acid berkelium does not react rapidly with oxygen at room temperature possibly due to the formation of a protective oxide layer surface however it reacts with molten metals hydrogen halogens chalcogens and pnictogens to form various binary compounds isotopes about twenty isotopes and six nuclear isomers excited states of an isotope of berkelium have been characterized with the mass numbers ranging from to except and all of them are radioactive the longest half lives are observed for bk years bk over years and bk days the half lives of the other isotopes range from microseconds to several days the isotope which is the easiest to synthesize is berkelium this emits mostly soft particles which are inconvenient for detection its alpha radiation is rather weak with respect to the radiation but is sometimes used to detect this isotope the second important berkelium isotope berkelium is an alpha emitter as are most actinide isotopes occurrence all berkelium isotopes have a half life far too short to be primordial therefore any primordial berkelium that is berkelium present on the earth during its formation has decayed by now on earth berkelium is mostly concentrated in certain areas which were used for the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests between and as well as at the sites of nuclear incidents such as the chernobyl disaster three mile island accident and thule air base b crash analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first united states first thermonuclear weapon ivy mike november enewetak atoll revealed high concentrations of various actinides including berkelium for reasons of military secrecy this result was not published until nuclear reactors produce mostly among the berkelium isotopes berkelium during the storage and before the fuel disposal most of it beta decays to californium the latter has a half life of years which is relatively long when compared to the other isotopes produced in the reactor and is therefore undesirable in the disposal products the transuranium elements from americium to fermium including berkelium occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at oklo but no longer do so berkelium is also one of the elements that have been detected in przybylski s star history although very small amounts of berkelium were possibly produced in previous nuclear experiments it was first intentionally synthesized isolated and identified in december by glenn t seaborg albert ghiorso stanley gerald thompson and kenneth street jr they used the inch cyclotron at the university of california berkeley similar to the nearly simultaneous discovery of americium element and curium element in the new elements berkelium and californium element were both produced in the name choice for element followed the previous tradition of the californian group to draw an analogy between the newly discovered actinide and the lanthanide element positioned above it in the periodic table previously americium was named after a continent as its analogue europium and curium honored scientists marie and pierre curie as the lanthanide above it gadolinium was named after the explorer of the rare earth elements johan gadolin thus the discovery report by the berkeley group reads it is suggested that element be given the name berkelium symbol bk after the city of berkeley in a manner similar to that used in naming its chemical homologue terbium atomic number whose name was derived from the town of ytterby sweden where the rare earth minerals were first found this tradition ended with berkelium though as the naming of the next discovered actinide californium was not related to its lanthanide analogue dysprosium but after the discovery place the most difficult steps in the synthesis of berkelium were its separation from the final products and the production of sufficient quantities of americium for the target material first americium am nitrate solution was coated on a platinum foil the solution was evaporated and the residue converted by annealing to americium dioxide amo this target was irradiated with mev alpha particles for hours in the inch cyclotron at the lawrence radiation laboratory university of california berkeley the n reaction induced by the irradiation yielded the bk isotope and two free neutrons am he bk nafter the irradiation the coating was dissolved with nitric acid and then precipitated as the hydroxide using concentrated aqueous ammonia solution the product was centrifugated and re dissolved in nitric acid to separate berkelium from the unreacted americium this solution was added to a mixture of ammonium and ammonium sulfate and heated to convert all the dissolved americium into the oxidation state unoxidized residual americium was precipitated by the addition of hydrofluoric acid as americium iii fluoride amf this step yielded a mixture of the accompanying product curium and the expected element in form of trifluorides the mixture was converted to the corresponding hydroxides by treating it with potassium hydroxide and after centrifugation was dissolved in perchloric acid further separation was carried out in the presence of a citric acid ammonium buffer solution in a weakly acidic medium ph using ion exchange at elevated temperature the chromatographic separation behavior was unknown for the element at the time but was anticipated by analogy with terbium the first results were disappointing because no alpha particle emission signature could be detected from the elution product with further analysis searching for characteristic x rays and conversion electron signals a berkelium isotope was eventually detected its mass number was uncertain between and in the initial report but was later established as synthesis and extraction preparation of isotopes berkelium is produced by bombarding lighter actinides uranium u or plutonium pu with neutrons in a nuclear reactor in a more common case of uranium fuel plutonium is produced first by neutron capture the so called n reaction or neutron fusion followed by beta decay u n u min np d pu displaystyle ce u ce n gamma u beta ce min np beta ce d pu the times are half lives plutonium is further irradiated by a source that has a high neutron flux several times higher than a conventional nuclear reactor such as the megawatt high flux isotope reactor hfir at the oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee usa the higher flux promotes fusion reactions involving not one but several neutrons converting pu to cm and then to cm pu n pu h am n am h cm cm n cm displaystyle begin aligned ce pu ce n gamma pu beta ce h am ce n gamma am beta ce h ce cm ce cm ce n gamma cm end aligned curium has a short half life of minutes and thus its further conversion to cm has a low probability instead it transforms by beta decay into bk cm min bk d cf displaystyle ce cm beta ce min bk beta ce d cf the thus produced bk has a long half life of days and thus can capture another neutron however the product bk again has a relatively short half life of hours and thus does not yield any heavier berkelium isotopes it instead decays to the californium isotope cf bk n bk h cf displaystyle ce bk ce n gamma bk beta ce h cf although bk is the most stable isotope of berkelium its production in nuclear reactors is very difficult because its potential progenitor cm has never been observed to undergo beta decay thus bk is the most accessible isotope of berkelium which still is available only in small quantities only grams have been produced in the us over the period at a high price of the order usd per microgram it is the only berkelium isotope available in bulk quantities and thus the only berkelium isotope whose properties can be extensively studied the isotope bk was first obtained in by bombarding a mixture of curium isotopes with mev particles although its direct detection was hindered by strong signal interference with bk the existence of a new isotope was proven by the growth of the decay product cf which had been previously characterized the half life of bk was estimated as hours though later work gave a half life in excess of years which may be due to an isomeric state berkelium was produced during the same year by irradiating cm with alpha particles cm n cf h bk cm p bk displaystyle begin cases ce cm ce alpha n cf epsilon ce h bk ce cm ce alpha p bk end cases berkelium was synthesized in by bombarding u with b u with b th with n or th with n it converts by electron capture to cm

n ce th n bk n ce u b bk n ce th n bk n end cases separation the fact that berkelium readily assumes oxidation state in solids and is relatively stable in this state in liquids greatly assists separation of berkelium away from many other actinides these are inevitably produced in relatively large amounts during the nuclear synthesis and often favor the state this fact was not yet known in the initial experiments which used a more complex separation procedure various inorganic oxidation agents can be applied to the berkelium iii solutions to convert it to the state such as bromates bro bismuthates bio chromates cro and cr o silver i thiolate ag s o lead iv oxide pbo ozone o or photochemical oxidation procedures more recently it has been discovered that some organic and bio inspired molecules such as the chelator called li hopo can also oxidize bk iii and stabilize bk iv under mild conditions berkelium iv is then extracted with ion exchange extraction chromatography or liquid liquid extraction using hdehp bis ethylhexyl phosphoric acid amines tributyl phosphate or various other reagents these procedures separate berkelium from most trivalent actinides and lanthanides except for the lanthanide cerium lanthanides are absent in the irradiation target but are created in various nuclear fission decay chains a more detailed procedure adopted at the oak ridge national laboratory was as follows the initial mixture of actinides is processed with ion exchange using lithium chloride reagent then precipitated as hydroxides filtered and dissolved in nitric acid it is then treated with high pressure elution from cation exchange resins and the berkelium phase is oxidized and extracted using one of the procedures described above reduction of the thus obtained berkelium iv to the oxidation state yields a solution which is nearly free from other actinides but contains cerium berkelium and cerium are then separated with another round of ion exchange treatment bulk metal preparation in order to characterize chemical and physical properties of solid berkelium and its compounds a program was initiated in at the material testing reactor arco idaho us it resulted in preparation of an eight gram plutonium target and in the first production of macroscopic quantities micrograms of berkelium by burris b cunningham and stanley gerald thompson in after a continuous reactor irradiation of this target for six years this irradiation method was and still is the only way of producing weighable amounts of the element and most solid state studies of berkelium have been conducted on microgram or submicrogram sized samples the world s major irradiation sources are the megawatt high flux isotope reactor at the oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee usa and the sm loop reactor at the research institute of atomic reactors niiar in dimitrovgrad russia which are both dedicated to the production of transcurium elements atomic number greater than these facilities have similar power and flux levels and are expected to have comparable production capacities for transcurium elements although the quantities produced at niiar are not publicly reported in a typical processing campaign at oak ridge tens of grams of curium are irradiated to produce decigram quantities of californium milligram quantities of berkelium and einsteinium and picogram quantities of fermium in total just over one gram of berkelium has been produced at oak ridge since the first berkelium metal sample weighing micrograms was prepared in by the reduction of berkelium iii fluoride with lithium vapor at c the fluoride was suspended on a tungsten wire above a tantalum crucible containing molten lithium later metal samples weighing up to milligrams were obtained with this method bkf li bk lifsimilar results are obtained with berkelium iv fluoride berkelium metal can also be produced by the reduction of berkelium iv oxide with thorium or lanthanum compounds oxides two oxides of berkelium are known with the berkelium oxidation state of bk o and bko berkelium iv oxide is a brown solid while berkelium iii oxide is a yellow green solid with a melting point of c and is formed from bko by reduction with molecular hydrogen bko h bk o h oupon heating to c the oxide bk o undergoes a phase change it undergoes another phase change at c such three phase behavior is typical for the actinide sesquioxides berkelium ii oxide bko has been reported as a brittle gray solid but its exact chemical composition remains uncertain halides in halides berkelium assumes the oxidation states and the state is the most stable especially in solutions while the tetravalent halides bkf and cs bkcl are only known in the solid phase the coordination of berkelium atom in its trivalent fluoride and chloride is tricapped trigonal prismatic with the coordination number of in trivalent bromide it is bicapped trigonal prismatic coordination or octahedral coordination and in the iodide it is octahedral berkelium iv fluoride bkf is a yellow green ionic solid and is isotypic with uranium tetrafluoride or zirconium tetrafluoride berkelium iii fluoride bkf is also a yellow green solid but it has two crystalline structures the most stable phase at low temperatures is isotypic with yttrium iii fluoride while upon heating to between and c it transforms to the structure found in lanthanum trifluoride visible amounts of berkelium iii chloride bkcl were first isolated and characterized in and weighed only billionths of a gram it can be prepared by introducing hydrogen chloride vapors into an evacuated quartz tube containing berkelium oxide at a temperature about c this green solid has a melting point of c and is isotypic with uranium iii chloride upon heating to nearly melting point bkcl converts into an orthorhombic phase two forms of berkelium iii bromide are known one with berkelium having coordination and one with coordination the latter is less stable and transforms to the former phase upon heating to about c an important phenomenon for radioactive solids has been studied on these two crystal forms the structure of fresh and aged bkbr samples was probed by x ray diffraction over a period longer than years so that various fractions of berkelium had beta decayed to californium no change in structure was observed upon the bkbr cfbr transformation however other differences were noted for bkbr and cfbr for example the latter could be reduced with hydrogen to cfbr but the former could not this result was reproduced on individual bkbr and cfbr samples as well on the samples containing both bromides the intergrowth of californium in berkelium occurs at a rate of per day and is an intrinsic obstacle in studying berkelium properties beside a chemical contamination cf being an alpha emitter brings undesirable self damage of the crystal lattice and the resulting self heating the chemical effect however can be avoided by performing measurements as a function of time and extrapolating the obtained results other inorganic compounds the pnictides of berkelium of the type bkx are known for the elements nitrogen phosphorus arsenic and antimony they crystallize in the rock salt structure and are prepared by the reaction of either berkelium iii hydride bkh or metallic berkelium with these elements at elevated temperature about c under high vacuum berkelium iii sulfide bk s is prepared by either treating berkelium oxide with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide vapors at c or by directly reacting metallic berkelium with elemental sulfur these procedures yield brownish black crystals berkelium iii and berkelium iv hydroxides are both stable in molar solutions of sodium hydroxide berkelium iii phosphate bkpo has been prepared as a solid which shows strong fluorescence under excitation with a green light berkelium hydrides are produced by reacting metal with hydrogen gas at temperatures about c they are non stoichiometric with the nominal formula bkh x x several other salts of berkelium are known including an oxysulfide bk o s and hydrated nitrate bk no h o chloride bkcl h o sulfate bk so h o and oxalate bk c o h o thermal decomposition at about c in an argon atmosphere to avoid oxidation to bko of bk so h o yields the crystals of berkelium iii oxysulfate bk o so this compound is thermally stable to at least c in inert atmosphere organoberkelium compounds berkelium forms a trigonal c h bk metallocene complex with three cyclopentadienyl rings which can be synthesized by reacting berkelium iii chloride with the molten beryllocene be c h at about c it has an amber color and a density of g cm the complex is stable to heating to at least c and sublimates without melting at about c the high radioactivity of berkelium gradually destroys the compound within a period of weeks one cyclopentadienyl ring in c h bk can be substituted by chlorine to yield bk c h cl the optical absorption spectra of this compound are very similar to those of c h bk applications there is currently no use for any isotope of berkelium outside basic scientific research berkelium is a common target nuclide to prepare still heavier transuranium elements and superheavy elements such as lawrencium rutherfordium and bohrium it is also useful as a source of the isotope californium which is used for studies on the chemistry of californium in preference to the more radioactive californium that is produced in neutron bombardment facilities such as the hfir a milligram batch of berkelium was prepared in a day irradiation and then purified for days at oak ridge in this target yielded the first atoms of tennessine at the joint institute for nuclear research jinr dubna russia after bombarding it with calcium ions in the u cyclotron for days this synthesis was a culmination of the russia us collaboration between jinr and lawrence livermore national laboratory on the synthesis of elements to which was initiated in nuclear fuel cycle the nuclear fission properties of berkelium are different from those of the neighboring actinides curium and californium and they suggest berkelium to perform poorly as a fuel in a nuclear reactor specifically berkelium has a moderately large neutron capture cross section of barns for thermal neutrons barns resonance integral but very low fission cross section for thermal neutrons in a thermal reactor much of it will therefore be converted to berkelium which quickly decays to californium in principle berkelium can sustain a nuclear chain reaction in a fast breeder reactor its critical mass is relatively high at kg it can be reduced with a water or steel reflector but would still exceed the world production of this isotope berkelium can maintain chain reaction both in a thermal neutron and in a fast neutron reactor however its production is rather complex and thus the availability is much lower than its critical mass which is about kg for a bare sphere kg with a water reflector and kg with a steel reflector cm thickness health issues little is known about the effects of berkelium on human body and analogies with other elements may not be drawn because of different radiation products electrons for berkelium and alpha particles neutrons or both for most other actinides the low energy of electrons emitted from berkelium less than kev hinders its detection due to signal interference with other decay processes but also makes this isotope relatively harmless to humans as compared to other actinides however berkelium transforms with a half life of only days to the strong alpha emitter californium which is rather dangerous and has to be handled in a glovebox in a dedicated laboratory most available berkelium toxicity data originate from research on animals upon ingestion by rats only about of berkelium ends in the blood stream from there about goes to the bones where it remains for about years to the lungs biological half life about years to the testicles or to the ovaries where berkelium stays indefinitely the balance of about is excreted in all these organs berkelium might promote cancer and in the skeleton its radiation can damage red blood cells the maximum permissible amount of berkelium in the human skeleton is nanograms ,97
Californium,Cf,californium is a radioactive chemical element with the symbol cf and atomic number the element was first synthesized in at lawrence berkeley national laboratory then the university of california radiation laboratory by bombarding curium with alpha particles helium ions it is an actinide element the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized and has the second highest atomic mass of all elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see with the naked eye after einsteinium the element was named after the university and the u s state of california two crystalline forms exist for californium at normal pressure one above and one below c f a third form exists at high pressure californium slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature californium compounds are dominated by the oxidation state the most stable of californium s twenty known isotopes is californium with a half life of years this short half life means the element is not found in significant quantities in the earth s crust cf with a half life of about years is the most common isotope used and is produced at oak ridge national laboratory in the united states and research institute of atomic reactors in russia californium is one of the few transuranium elements with practical applications most of these applications exploit the property of certain isotopes of californium to emit neutrons for example californium can be used to help start up nuclear reactors and it is employed as a source of neutrons when studying materials using neutron diffraction and neutron spectroscopy californium can also be used in nuclear synthesis of higher mass elements oganesson element was synthesized by bombarding californium atoms with calcium ions users of californium must take into account radiological concerns and the element s ability to disrupt the formation of red blood cells by bioaccumulating in skeletal tissue characteristics physical properties californium is a silvery white actinide metal with a melting point of c f and an estimated boiling point of k c f the pure metal is malleable and is easily cut with a razor blade californium metal starts to vaporize above c f when exposed to a vacuum below k c f californium metal is either ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic it acts like a magnet between and k it is antiferromagnetic an intermediate state and above k c f it is paramagnetic external magnetic fields can make it magnetic it forms alloys with lanthanide metals but little is known about the resulting materials the element has two crystalline forms at standard atmospheric pressure a double hexagonal close packed form dubbed alpha and a face centered cubic form designated beta the form exists below c with a density of g cm and the form exists above c with a density of g cm at gpa of pressure the form changes into an orthorhombic crystal system due to delocalization of the atom s f electrons which frees them to bond the bulk modulus of a material is a measure of its resistance to uniform pressure californium s bulk modulus is gpa which is similar to trivalent lanthanide metals but smaller than more familiar metals such as aluminium gpa chemical properties and compounds californium exhibits oxidation states of or it typically forms eight or nine bonds to surrounding atoms or ions its chemical properties are predicted to be similar to other primarily valence actinide elements and the element dysprosium which is the lanthanide above californium in the periodic table compounds in the oxidation state are strong oxidizing agents and those in the state are strong reducing agents the element slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature with the rate increasing when moisture is added californium reacts when heated with hydrogen nitrogen or a chalcogen oxygen family element reactions with dry hydrogen and aqueous mineral acids are rapid californium is only water soluble as the californium iii cation attempts to reduce or oxidize the ion in solution have failed the element forms a water soluble chloride nitrate perchlorate and sulfate and is precipitated as a fluoride oxalate or hydroxide californium is the heaviest actinide to exhibit covalent properties as is observed in the californium borate isotopes twenty isotopes of californium are known mass number ranging from to the most stable are cf with half life years cf with half life years cf with half life years and cf with half life years all other isotopes have half life shorter than a year and most of these have half life less than minutes cf is formed from beta decay of berkelium and most other californium isotopes are made by subjecting berkelium to intense neutron radiation in a nuclear reactor though californium has the longest half life its production yield is only due to its tendency to collect neutrons high neutron capture and its tendency to interact with other particles high neutron cross section californium is a very strong neutron emitter which makes it extremely radioactive and harmful cf of the time alpha decays to curium the other of decays are spontaneous fission one microgram g of cf emits million neutrons per second an average of neutrons per spontaneous fission most other isotopes of californium alpha decay to curium atomic number history californium was first made at university of california radiation laboratory berkeley by physics researchers stanley gerald thompson kenneth street jr albert ghiorso and glenn t seaborg about february it was the sixth transuranium element to be discovered the team announced its discovery on march to produce californium a microgram size target of curium cm was bombarded with mev alpha particles he in the inch diameter m cyclotron at berkeley which produced californium cf plus one free neutron n cm he cf nto identify and separate out the element ion exchange and adsorsion methods were undertaken only about atoms of californium were produced in this experiment and these atoms had a half life of minutes the discoverers named the new element after the university and the state this was a break from the convention used for elements to which drew inspiration from how the elements directly above them in the periodic table were named however the element directly above in the periodic table dysprosium has a name that means hard to get at so the researchers decided to set aside the informal naming convention they added that the best we can do is to point out that searchers a century ago found it difficult to get to california weighable amounts of californium were first produced by the irradiation of plutonium targets at materials testing reactor at national reactor testing station eastern idaho these findings were reported in the high spontaneous fission rate of californium was observed in these samples the first experiment with californium in concentrated form occurred in the isotopes cf to cf were isolated that same year from a sample of plutonium that had been irradiated with neutrons in a nuclear reactor for five years two years later in burris cunningham and james wallman of lawrence radiation laboratory of the university of california created the first californium compounds californium trichloride californium iii oxychloride and californium oxide by treating californium with steam and hydrochloric acid the high flux isotope reactor hfir at oak ridge national laboratory ornl in oak ridge tennessee started producing small batches of californium in the s by hfir nominally produced milligrams oz of californium annually plutonium supplied by the united kingdom to the united states under the us uk mutual defence agreement was used for making californium the atomic energy commission sold cf to industrial and academic customers in the early s for per microgram and an average of mg oz of cf were shipped each year from to californium metal was first prepared in by haire and baybarz who reduced californium iii oxide with lanthanum metal to obtain microgram amounts of sub micrometer thick films occurrence traces of californium can be found near facilities that use the element in mineral prospecting and in medical treatments the element is fairly insoluble in water but it adheres well to ordinary soil and concentrations of it in the soil can be times higher than in the water surrounding the soil particles nuclear fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing prior to contributed a small amount of californium to the environment californium isotopes with mass numbers and have been observed in the radioactive dust collected from the air after a nuclear explosion californium is not a major radionuclide at united states department of energy legacy sites since it was not produced in large quantities californium was once believed to be produced in supernovas as their decay matches the day half life of cf however subsequent studies failed to demonstrate any californium spectra and supernova light curves are now thought to follow the decay of nickel the transuranium elements from americium to fermium including californium occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at oklo but no longer do so spectral lines of californium along with those of several other non primordial elements were detected in przybylski s star in production californium is produced in nuclear reactors and particle accelerators californium is made by bombarding berkelium bk with neutrons forming berkelium bk via neutron capture n which in turn quickly beta decays to californium cf in the following reaction bk n bk cf bombardment of californium with neutrons produces californium and californium prolonged irradiation of americium curium and plutonium with neutrons produces milligram amounts of californium and microgram amounts of californium as of curium isotopes to are irradiated by neutrons in special reactors to produce primarily californium with lesser amounts of isotopes to microgram quantities of californium are available for commercial use through the u s nuclear regulatory commission only two sites produce californium the oak ridge national laboratory in the united states and the research institute of atomic reactors in dimitrovgrad russia as of the two sites produce grams and grams of californium per year respectively three californium isotopes with significant half lives are produced requiring a total of neutron captures by uranium without nuclear fission or alpha decay occurring during the process californium is at the end of a production chain that starts with uranium includes several isotopes of plutonium americium curium berkelium and the californium isotopes to see diagram applications californium has a number of specialized uses as a strong neutron emitter it produces million neutrons per microgram per minute this property makes it useful as a startup neutron source for some nuclear reactors and as a portable non reactor based neutron source for neutron activation analysis to detect trace amounts of elements in samples neutrons from californium are used as a treatment of certain cervical and brain cancers where other radiation therapy is ineffective it has been used in educational applications since when georgia institute of technology got a loan of g of cf from the savannah river site it is also used with online elemental coal analyzers and bulk material analyzers in the coal and cement industries neutron penetration into materials makes californium useful in detection instruments such as fuel rod scanners neutron radiography of aircraft and weapons components to detect corrosion bad welds cracks and trapped moisture and in portable metal detectors neutron moisture gauges use cf to find water and petroleum layers in oil wells as a portable neutron source for gold and silver prospecting for on the spot analysis and to detect ground water movement the main uses of cf in were reactor start up fuel rod scanning and activation analysis by most cf was used in neutron radiography with fuel rod scanning and reactor start up as important but secondary uses in fast neutrons from cf were used for wireless data transmission cf has a very small calculated critical mass of about kg lb high lethality and a relatively short period of toxic environmental irradiation the low critical mass of californium led to some exaggerated claims about possible uses for the element in october researchers announced that three atoms of oganesson element had been identified at joint institute for nuclear research in dubna russia from bombarding cf with calcium making it the heaviest element ever made the target contained about mg of cf deposited on a titanium foil of cm area californium has also been used to produce other transuranium elements for example element later named lawrencium was first synthesized in by bombarding californium with boron nuclei precautions californium that bioaccumulates in skeletal tissue releases radiation that disrupts the body s ability to form red blood cells the element plays no natural biological role in any organism due to its intense radioactivity and low concentration in the environment californium can enter the body from ingesting contaminated food or drinks or by breathing air with suspended particles of the element once in the body only of the californium will reach the bloodstream about of that californium will be deposited in the skeleton in the liver and the rest in other organs or excreted mainly in urine half of the californium deposited in the skeleton and liver are gone in and years respectively californium in the skeleton adheres to bone surfaces before slowly migrating throughout the bone the element is most dangerous if taken into the body in addition californium and californium can cause tissue damage externally through gamma ray emission ionizing radiation emitted by californium on bone and in the liver can cause cancer ,98
Einsteinium,Es,einsteinium is a synthetic element with the symbol es and atomic number einsteinium is a member of the actinide series and it is the seventh transuranium element it was named in honor of albert einstein einsteinium was discovered as a component of the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in its most common isotope einsteinium half life days is produced artificially from decay of californium in a few dedicated high power nuclear reactors with a total yield on the order of one milligram per year the reactor synthesis is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium from other actinides and products of their decay other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories but in much smaller amounts by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions owing to the small amounts of produced einsteinium and the short half life of its most easily produced isotope there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside basic scientific research in particular einsteinium was used to synthesize for the first time atoms of the new element mendelevium in einsteinium is a soft silvery paramagnetic metal its chemistry is typical of the late actinides with a preponderance of the oxidation state the oxidation state is also accessible especially in solids the high radioactivity of einsteinium produces a visible glow and rapidly damages its crystalline metal lattice with released heat of about watts per gram difficulty in studying its properties is due to einsteinium s decay to berkelium and then californium at a rate of about per day the isotope of einsteinium with the longest half life einsteinium half life days would be more suitable for investigation of physical properties but it has proven far more difficult to produce and is available only in minute quantities and not in bulk einsteinium is the element with the highest atomic number which has been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form and this was the common short lived isotope einsteinium like all synthetic transuranium elements isotopes of einsteinium are very radioactive and are considered highly dangerous to health on ingestion history einsteinium was first identified in december by albert ghiorso and co workers at the university of california berkeley in collaboration with the argonne and los alamos national laboratories in the fallout from the ivy mike nuclear test the test was carried out on november at enewetak atoll in the pacific ocean and was the first successful test of a thermonuclear weapon initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of plutonium pu which could only have formed by the absorption of six neutrons by a uranium nucleus followed by two beta decays u n pu displaystyle ce u ce n gamma beta pu at the time the multiple neutron absorption was thought to be an extremely rare process but the identification of pu indicated that still more neutrons could have been captured by the uranium nuclei thereby producing new elements heavier than californium ghiorso and co workers analyzed filter papers which had been flown through the explosion cloud on airplanes the same sampling technique that had been used to discover pu larger amounts of radioactive material were later isolated from coral debris of the atoll which were delivered to the u s the separation of suspected new elements was carried out in the presence of a citric acid ammonium buffer solution in a weakly acidic medium ph using ion exchange at elevated temperatures fewer than atoms of einsteinium were recovered in the end nevertheless element einsteinium namely its es isotope could be detected via its characteristic high energy alpha decay at mev it was produced by the capture of neutrons by uranium nuclei followed by seven beta decays and had a half life of days such multiple neutron absorption was made possible by the high neutron flux density during the detonation so that newly generated heavy isotopes had plenty of available neutrons to absorb before they could disintegrate into lighter elements neutron capture initially raised the mass number without changing the atomic number of the nuclide and the concomitant beta decays resulted in a gradual increase in the atomic number u n cf es displaystyle ce u ce n beta cf beta es some u atoms however could absorb two additional neutrons for a total of resulting in es as well as in the fm isotope of another new element fermium the discovery of the new elements and the associated new data on multiple neutron capture were initially kept secret on the orders of the u s military until due to cold war tensions and competition with soviet union in nuclear technologies however the rapid capture of so many neutrons would provide needed direct experimental confirmation of the so called r process multiple neutron absorption needed to explain the cosmic nucleosynthesis production of certain heavy chemical elements heavier than nickel in supernova explosions before beta decay such a process is needed to explain the existence of many stable elements in the universe meanwhile isotopes of element as well as of new element fermium were produced in the berkeley and argonee laboratories in a nuclear reaction between nitrogen and uranium and later by intense neutron irradiation of plutonium or californium cf n cf d es n es fm displaystyle ce cf ce n gamma cf beta ce d es ce n gamma es beta fm these results were published in several articles in with the disclaimer that these were not the first studies that had been carried out on the elements the berkeley team also reported some results on the chemical properties of einsteinium and fermium the ivy mike results were declassified and published in in their discovery of the elements and the american teams had competed with a group at the nobel institute for physics stockholm sweden in late early the swedish group succeeded in the synthesis of light isotopes of element in particular fm by bombarding uranium with oxygen nuclei these results were also published in nevertheless the priority of the berkeley team was generally recognized as its publications preceded the swedish article and they were based on the previously undisclosed results of the thermonuclear explosion thus the berkeley team was given the privilege to name the new elements as the effort which had led to the design of ivy mike was codenamed project panda element had been jokingly nicknamed pandemonium but the official names suggested by the berkeley group derived from two prominent scientists albert einstein and enrico fermi we suggest for the name for the element with the atomic number einsteinium symbol e after albert einstein and for the name for the element with atomic number fermium symbol fm after enrico fermi both einstein and fermi died between the time the names were originally proposed and when they were announced the discovery of these new elements was announced by albert ghiorso at the first geneva atomic conference held on august the symbol for einsteinium was first given as e and later changed to es by iupac characteristics physical einsteinium is a synthetic silver radioactive metal in the periodic table it is located to the right of the actinide californium to the left of the actinide fermium and below the lanthanide holmium with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties its density of g cm is lower than that of californium g cm and is nearly the same as that of holmium g cm despite atomic einsteinium being much heavier than holmium the melting point of einsteinium c is also relatively low below californium c fermium c and holmium c einsteinium is a soft metal with the bulk modulus of only gpa which value is one of the lowest among non alkali metals contrary to the lighter actinides californium berkelium curium and americium which crystallize in a double hexagonal structure at ambient conditions einsteinium is believed to have a face centered cubic fcc symmetry with the space group fm m and the lattice constant a pm however there is a report of room temperature hexagonal einsteinium metal with a pm and c pm which converted to the fcc phase upon heating to c the self damage induced by the radioactivity of einsteinium is so strong that it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice and the energy release during this process watts per gram of es induces a visible glow these processes may contribute to the relatively low density and melting point of einsteinium further owing to the small size of the available samples the melting point of einsteinium was often deduced by observing the sample being heated inside an electron microscope thus the surface effects in small samples could reduce the melting point value the metal is trivalent and has a noticeably high volatility in order to reduce the self radiation damage most measurements of solid einsteinium and its compounds are performed right after thermal annealing also some compounds are studied under the atmosphere of the reductant gas for example h o hcl for esocl so that the sample is partly regrown during its decomposition apart from the self destruction of solid einsteinium and its compounds other intrinsic difficulties in studying this element include scarcity the most common es isotope is available only once or twice a year in sub milligram amounts and self contamination due to rapid conversion of einsteinium to berkelium and then to californium at a rate of about per day es d bk d cf displaystyle ce es alpha ce d bk beta ce d cf thus most einsteinium samples are contaminated and their intrinsic properties are often deduced by extrapolating back experimental data accumulated over time other experimental techniques to circumvent the contamination problem include selective optical excitation of einsteinium ions by a tunable laser such as in studying its luminescence properties magnetic properties have been studied for einsteinium metal its oxide and fluoride all three materials showed curie weiss paramagnetic behavior from liquid helium to room temperature the effective magnetic moments were deduced as b for es o and b for the esf which are the highest values among actinides and the corresponding curie temperatures are and k chemical like all actinides einsteinium is rather reactive its trivalent oxidation state is most stable in solids and aqueous solution where it induces a pale pink color the existence of divalent einsteinium is firmly established especially in the solid phase such state is not observed in many other actinides including protactinium uranium neptunium plutonium curium and berkelium einsteinium ii compounds can be obtained for example by reducing einsteinium iii with samarium ii chloride the oxidation state was postulated from vapor studies and is as yet uncertain isotopes nineteen isotopes and three nuclear isomers are known for einsteinium with mass numbers ranging from to all are radioactive and the most stable nuclide es has a half life of days the next most stable isotopes are es half life days es days and es days all of the remaining isotopes have half lives shorter than hours most shorter than minutes of the three nuclear isomers the most stable is mes with a half life of hours nuclear fission einsteinium has a high rate of nuclear fission that results in a low critical mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction this mass is kilograms for a bare sphere of es isotope and can be lowered to kilograms by adding a centimeter thick steel neutron reflector or even to kilograms with a cm thick reflector made of water however even this small critical mass greatly exceeds the total amount of einsteinium isolated thus far especially of the rare es isotope natural occurrence because of the short half life of all isotopes of einsteinium any primordial einsteinium that is einsteinium that could possibly have been present on the earth during its formation has long since decayed synthesis of einsteinium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the earth s crust requires multiple neutron capture which is an extremely unlikely event therefore all terrestrial einsteinium is produced in scientific laboratories high power nuclear reactors or in nuclear weapons tests and is present only within a few years from the time of the synthesis the transuranic elements from americium to fermium including einsteinium occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at oklo but no longer do so einsteinium was theoretically observed in the spectrum of przybylski s star however the lead author of the studies finding einsteinium and other short lived actinides in przybylski s star vera f gopka directly admits that the position of lines of the radioactive elements under search were simply visualized in synthetic spectrum as vertical markers because there are no any atomic data for these lines except for their wavelengths sansonetti et al enabling one to calculate their profiles with more or less real intensities the signature spectra of einsteinium s isotopes have since been comprehensively analyzed experimentally in though there is currently no published research confirming whether the theorized einsteinium signatures proposed to be found in the star s spectrum match the lab determined results synthesis and extraction einsteinium is produced in minute quantities by bombarding lighter actinides with neutrons in dedicated high flux nuclear reactors the world s major irradiation sources are the megawatt high flux isotope reactor hfir at the oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee u s and the sm loop reactor at the research institute of atomic reactors niiar in dimitrovgrad russia which are both dedicated to the production of transcurium z elements these facilities have similar power and flux levels and are expected to have comparable production capacities for transcurium elements although the quantities produced at niiar are not widely reported in a typical processing campaign at oak ridge tens of grams of curium are irradiated to produce decigram quantities of californium milligram quantities of berkelium bk and einsteinium and picogram quantities of fermium the first microscopic sample of es sample weighing about nanograms was prepared in at hfir a special magnetic balance was designed to estimate its weight larger batches were produced later starting from several kilograms of plutonium with the einsteinium yields mostly es of milligrams in milligrams in followed by steady production of about milligrams per year between and these quantities however refer to the integral amount in the target right after irradiation subsequent separation procedures reduced the amount of isotopically pure einsteinium roughly tenfold laboratory synthesis heavy neutron irradiation of plutonium results in four major isotopes of einsteinium es emitter with half life of days and with a spontaneous fission half life of years mes emitter with half life of hours es emitter with half life of about days and es emitter with half life of days an alternative route involves bombardment of uranium with high intensity nitrogen or oxygen ion beams einsteinium half life minutes was produced by irradiating americium with carbon or uranium with nitrogen ions the latter reaction was first realized in in dubna russia and the involved scientists were awarded the lenin komsomol prize the isotope es was produced by irradiating cf with deuterium ions it mainly decays by emission of electrons to cf with a half life of minutes but also releases particles of mev energy with the ratio of electrons to particles of about cf d es n es min cf displaystyle ce cf d es n quad left ce es epsilon ce min cf right the heavier isotopes es es es and es were obtained by bombarding bk with particles one to four neutrons are liberated in this process making possible the formation of four different isotopes in one reaction bk es displaystyle ce bk alpha es einsteinium was produced by irradiating a milligram cf target with a thermal neutron flux of neutrons cm s for hours cf n cf d es displaystyle ce cf ce n gamma cf beta ce d es in scientists at the oak ridge national laboratory were able to create nanograms of es a new world record this allowed some chemical properties of the element to be studied for the first time synthesis in nuclear explosions the analysis of the debris at the megaton ivy mike nuclear test was a part of long term project one of the goals of which was studying the efficiency of production of transuranium elements in high power nuclear explosions the motivation for these experiments was that synthesis of such elements from uranium requires multiple neutron capture the probability of such events increases with the neutron flux and nuclear explosions are the most powerful man made neutron sources providing densities of the order neutrons cm within a microsecond or about neutrons cm s in comparison the flux of the hfir reactor is neutrons cm s a dedicated laboratory was set up right at enewetak atoll for preliminary analysis of debris as some isotopes could have decayed by the time the debris samples reached the mainland u s the laboratory was receiving samples for analysis as soon as possible from airplanes equipped with paper filters which flew over the atoll after the tests whereas it was hoped to discover new chemical elements heavier than fermium none of these were found even after a series of megaton explosions conducted between and at the atoll the atmospheric results were supplemented by the underground test data accumulated in the s at the nevada test site as it was hoped that powerful explosions conducted in confined space might result in improved yields and heavier isotopes apart from traditional uranium charges combinations of uranium with americium and thorium have been tried as well as a mixed plutonium neptunium charge but they were less successful in terms of yield and was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy element charges product isolation was problematic as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing the surrounding rocks at depths of meters drilling to such depths to extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes among the nine underground tests that were carried between and the last one was the most powerful and had the highest yield of transuranium elements milligrams of einsteinium that would normally take a year of irradiation in a high power reactor were produced within a microsecond however the major practical problem of the entire proposal was collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast aircraft filters adsorbed only about of the total amount and collection of tons of corals at enewetak atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude extraction of about kilograms of underground rocks days after the hutch explosion recovered only about of the total charge the amount of transuranium elements in this kg batch was only times higher than in a kg rock picked up days after the test which demonstrated the highly non linear dependence of the transuranium elements yield on the amount of retrieved radioactive rock shafts were drilled at the site before the test in order to accelerate sample collection after explosion so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter through the shafts and to collecting volumes near the surface this method was tried in two tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material but with actinide concentration times lower than in samples obtained after drilling whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short lived isotopes it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides although no new elements apart from einsteinium and fermium could be detected in the nuclear test debris and the total yields of transuranium elements were disappointingly low these tests did provide significantly higher amounts of rare heavy isotopes than previously available in laboratories separation separation procedure of einsteinium depends on the synthesis method in the case of light ion bombardment inside a cyclotron the heavy ion target is attached to a thin foil and the generated einsteinium is simply washed off the foil after the irradiation however the produced amounts in such experiments are relatively low the yields are much higher for reactor irradiation but there the product is a mixture of various actinide isotopes as well as lanthanides produced in the nuclear fission decays in this case isolation of einsteinium is a tedious procedure which involves several repeating steps of cation exchange at elevated temperature and pressure and chromatography separation from berkelium is important because the most common einsteinium isotope produced in nuclear reactors es decays with a half life of only days to bk which is fast on the timescale of most experiments such separation relies on the fact that berkelium easily oxidizes to the solid state and precipitates whereas other actinides including einsteinium remain in their state in solutions separation of trivalent actinides from lanthanide fission products can be done by a cation exchange resin column using a water ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid hcl as eluant it is usually followed by anion exchange chromatography using molar hcl as eluant a cation exchange resin column dowex exchange column treated with ammonium salts is then used to separate fractions containing elements and these elements can be then identified simply based on their elution position time using hydroxyisobutyrate solution hib for example as eluant separation of the actinides can also be achieved by solvent extraction chromatography using bis ethylhexyl phosphoric acid abbreviated as hdehp as the stationary organic phase and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase the actinide elution sequence is reversed from that of the cation exchange resin column the einsteinium separated by this method has the advantage to be free of organic complexing agent as compared to the separation using a resin column preparation of the metal einsteinium is highly reactive and therefore strong reducing agents are required to obtain the pure metal from its compounds this can be achieved by reduction of einsteinium iii fluoride with metallic lithium esf li es lifhowever owing to its low melting point and high rate of self radiation damage einsteinium has high vapor pressure which is higher than that of lithium fluoride this makes this reduction reaction rather inefficient it was tried in the early preparation attempts and quickly abandoned in favor of reduction of einsteinium iii oxide with lanthanum metal es o la es la o chemical compounds oxides einsteinium iii oxide es o was obtained by burning einsteinium iii nitrate it forms colorless cubic crystals which were first characterized from microgram samples sized about nanometers two other phases monoclinic and hexagonal are known for this oxide the formation of a certain es o phase depends on the preparation technique and sample history and there is no clear phase diagram interconversions between the three phases can occur spontaneously as a result of self irradiation or self heating the hexagonal phase is isotypic with lanthanum oxide where the es ion is surrounded by a coordinated group of o ions halides einsteinium halides are known for the oxidation states and the most stable state is for all halides from fluoride to iodide einsteinium iii fluoride esf can be precipitated from einsteinium iii chloride solutions upon reaction with fluoride ions an alternative preparation procedure is to exposure einsteinium iii oxide to chlorine trifluoride clf or f gas at a pressure of atmospheres and a temperature between and c the esf crystal structure is hexagonal as in californium iii fluoride cff where the es ions are fold coordinated by fluorine ions in a bicapped trigonal prism arrangement einsteinium iii chloride escl can be prepared by annealing einsteinium iii oxide in the atmosphere of dry hydrogen chloride vapors at about c for some minutes it crystallizes upon cooling at about c into an orange solid with a hexagonal structure of ucl type where einsteinium atoms are fold coordinated by chlorine atoms in a tricapped trigonal prism geometry einsteinium iii bromide esbr is a pale yellow solid with a monoclinic structure of alcl type where the einsteinium atoms are octahedrally coordinated by bromine coordination number the divalent compounds of einsteinium are obtained by reducing the trivalent halides with hydrogen esx h esx hx x f cl br ieinsteinium ii chloride escl einsteinium ii bromide esbr and einsteinium ii iodide esi have been produced and characterized by optical absorption with no structural information available yet known oxyhalides of einsteinium include esocl esobr and esoi these salts are synthesized by treating a trihalide with a vapor mixture of water and the corresponding hydrogen halide for example escl h o hcl to obtain esocl organoeinsteinium compounds the high radioactivity of einsteinium has a potential use in radiation therapy and organometallic complexes have been synthesized in order to deliver einsteinium atoms to an appropriate organ in the body experiments have been performed on injecting einsteinium citrate as well as fermium compounds to dogs einsteinium iii was also incorporated into beta diketone chelate complexes since analogous complexes with lanthanides previously showed strongest uv excited luminescence among metallorganic compounds when preparing einsteinium complexes the es ions were times diluted with gd ions this allowed reducing the radiation damage so that the compounds did not disintegrate during the period of minutes required for the measurements the resulting luminescence from es was much too weak to be detected this was explained by the unfavorable relative energies of the individual constituents of the compound that hindered efficient energy transfer from the chelate matrix to es ions similar conclusion was drawn for other actinides americium berkelium and fermium luminescence of es ions was however observed in inorganic hydrochloric acid solutions as well as in organic solution with di ethylhexyl orthophosphoric acid it shows a broad peak at about nanometers half width about nm which can be resonantly excited by green light ca nm wavelength the luminescence has a lifetime of several microseconds and the quantum yield below the relatively high compared to lanthanides non radiative decay rates in es were associated with the stronger interaction of f electrons with the inner es electrons applications there is almost no use for any isotope of einsteinium outside basic scientific research aiming at production of higher transuranium elements and superheavy elements in mendelevium was synthesized by irradiating a target consisting of about atoms of es in the inch cyclotron at berkeley laboratory the resulting es n md reaction yielded atoms of the new element with the atomic number of the rare isotope es is favored for production of superheavy elements because of its large mass relatively long half life of days and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms hence es was used as a target in the attempted synthesis of ununennium element in by bombarding it with calcium ions at the superhilac linear

Fermium,Fm,fermium is a synthetic element with the symbol fm and atomic number it is an actinide and the heaviest element that can be formed by neutron bombardment of lighter elements and hence the last element that can be prepared in macroscopic quantities although pure fermium metal has not yet been prepared a total of isotopes are known with fm being the longest lived with a half life of days it was discovered in the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in and named after enrico fermi one of the pioneers of nuclear physics its chemistry is typical for the late actinides with a preponderance of the oxidation state but also an accessible oxidation state owing to the small amounts of produced fermium and all of its isotopes having relatively short half lives there are currently no uses for it outside basic scientific research discovery fermium was first discovered in the fallout from the ivy mike nuclear test november the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of plutonium pu this could only have formed by the absorption of six neutrons by a uranium nucleus followed by two decays at the time the absorption of neutrons by a heavy nucleus was thought to be a rare process but the identification of pu raised the possibility that still more neutrons could have been absorbed by the uranium nuclei leading to new elements element einsteinium was quickly discovered on filter papers which had been flown through the cloud from the explosion the same sampling technique that had been used to discover pu it was then identified in december by albert ghiorso and co workers at the university of california at berkeley they discovered the isotope es half life days that was made by the capture of neutrons by uranium nuclei which then underwent seven successive beta decays some u atoms however could capture another amount of neutrons most likely or the discovery of fermium z required more material as the yield was expected to be at least an order of magnitude lower than that of element and so contaminated coral from the enewetak atoll where the test had taken place was shipped to the university of california radiation laboratory in berkeley california for processing and analysis about two months after the test a new component was isolated emitting high energy particles mev with a half life of about a day with such a short half life it could only arise from the decay of an isotope of einsteinium and so had to be an isotope of the new element it was quickly identified as fm t hours the discovery of the new elements and the new data on neutron capture was initially kept secret on the orders of the u s military until due to cold war tensions nevertheless the berkeley team was able to prepare elements and by civilian means through the neutron bombardment of plutonium and published this work in with the disclaimer that it was not the first studies that had been carried out on the elements the ivy mike studies were declassified and published in the berkeley team had been worried that another group might discover lighter isotopes of element through ion bombardment techniques before they could publish their classified research and this proved to be the case a group at the nobel institute for physics in stockholm independently discovered the element producing an isotope later confirmed to be fm t minutes by bombarding a u target with oxygen ions and published their work in may nevertheless the priority of the berkeley team was generally recognized and with it the prerogative to name the new element in honour of enrico fermi the developer of the first artificial self sustained nuclear reactor fermi was still alive when the name was proposed but had died by the time it became official isotopes there are isotopes of fermium listed in nubase with atomic weights of to of which fm is the longest lived with a half life of days fm has a half life of days while fm of h fm of h fm of h fm of h and fm of hours all the remaining ones have half lives ranging from minutes to less than a millisecond the neutron capture product of fermium fm undergoes spontaneous fission with a half life of just microseconds fm and fm are also unstable with respect to spontaneous fission t s and ms respectively this means that neutron capture cannot be used to create nuclides with a mass number greater than unless carried out in a nuclear explosion as fm is an emitter decaying to cf and no known fermium isotopes undergo beta minus decay to the next element mendelevium fermium is also the last element that can be prepared by a neutron capture process because of this impediment in forming heavier isotopes these short lived isotopes fm constitute the so called fermium gap production fermium is produced by the bombardment of lighter actinides with neutrons in a nuclear reactor fermium is the heaviest isotope that is obtained via neutron capture and can only be produced in picogram quantities the major source is the mw high flux isotope reactor hfir at the oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee usa which is dedicated to the production of transcurium z elements lower mass fermium isotopes are available in greater quantities though these isotopes fm and fm are comparatively short lived in a typical processing campaign at oak ridge tens of grams of curium are irradiated to produce decigram quantities of californium milligram quantities of berkelium and einsteinium and picogram quantities of fermium however nanogram quantities of fermium can be prepared for specific experiments the quantities of fermium produced in kiloton thermonuclear explosions is believed to be of the order of milligrams although it is mixed in with a huge quantity of debris picograms of fm was recovered from kilograms of debris from the hutch test july the hutch experiment produced an estimated total of micrograms of fm after production the fermium must be separated from other actinides and from lanthanide fission products this is usually achieved by ion exchange chromatography with the standard process using a cation exchanger such as dowex or teva eluted with a solution of ammonium hydroxyisobutyrate smaller cations form more stable complexes with the hydroxyisobutyrate anion and so are preferentially eluted from the column a rapid fractional crystallization method has also been described although the most stable isotope of fermium is fm with a half life of days most studies are conducted on fm t hours since this isotope can be easily isolated as required as the decay product of es t days synthesis in nuclear explosions the analysis of the debris at the megaton ivy mike nuclear test was a part of long term project one of the goals of which was studying the efficiency of production of transuranium elements in high power nuclear explosions the motivation for these experiments was as follows synthesis of such elements from uranium requires multiple neutron capture the probability of such events increases with the neutron flux and nuclear explosions are the most powerful neutron sources providing densities of the order neutrons cm within a microsecond i e about neutrons cm s in comparison the flux of the hfir reactor is neutrons cm s a dedicated laboratory was set up right at enewetak atoll for preliminary analysis of debris as some isotopes could have decayed by the time the debris samples reached the u s the laboratory was receiving samples for analysis as soon as possible from airplanes equipped with paper filters which flew over the atoll after the tests whereas it was hoped to discover new chemical elements heavier than fermium those were not found after a series of megaton explosions conducted between and at the atoll the atmospheric results were supplemented by the underground test data accumulated in the s at the nevada test site as it was hoped that powerful explosions conducted in confined space might result in improved yields and heavier isotopes apart from traditional uranium charges combinations of uranium with americium and thorium have been tried as well as a mixed plutonium neptunium charge they were less successful in terms of yield which was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy element charges isolation of the products was found to be rather problematic as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing rocks under the great depth of meters and drilling to such depth in order to extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes among the nine underground tests which were carried between and and codenamed anacostia kilotons kennebec kilotons par kilotons barbel kilotons tweed kilotons cyclamen kilotons kankakee kilotons vulcan kilotons and hutch kilotons the last one was most powerful and had the highest yield of transuranium elements in the dependence on the atomic mass number the yield showed a saw tooth behavior with the lower values for odd isotopes due to their higher fission rates the major practical problem of the entire proposal however was collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast aircraft filters adsorbed only about of the total amount and collection of tons of corals at enewetak atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude extraction of about kilograms of underground rocks days after the hutch explosion recovered only about of the total charge the amount of transuranium elements in this kg batch was only times higher than in a kg rock picked up days after the test this observation demonstrated the highly nonlinear dependence of the transuranium elements yield on the amount of retrieved radioactive rock in order to accelerate sample collection after explosion shafts were drilled at the site not after but before the test so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter through the shafts to collecting volumes near the surface this method was tried in the anacostia and kennebec tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material but with actinide concentration times lower than in samples obtained after drilling whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short lived isotopes it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides although no new elements apart from einsteinium and fermium could be detected in the nuclear test debris and the total yields of transuranium elements were disappointingly low these tests did provide significantly higher amounts of rare heavy isotopes than previously available in laboratories for example atoms of fm could be recovered after the hutch detonation they were then used in the studies of thermal neutron induced fission of fm and in discovery of a new fermium isotope fm also the rare cm isotope was synthesized in large quantities which is very difficult to produce in nuclear reactors from its progenitor cm the half life of cm minutes is much too short for months long reactor irradiations but is very long on the explosion timescale natural occurrence because of the short half life of all isotopes of fermium any primordial fermium that is fermium that could be present on the earth during its formation has decayed by now synthesis of fermium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the earth crust requires multiple neutron capture which is an extremely unlikely event therefore most fermium is produced on earth in scientific laboratories high power nuclear reactors or in nuclear weapons tests and is present only within a few months from the time of the synthesis the transuranic elements from americium to fermium did occur naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at oklo but no longer do so chemistry the chemistry of fermium has only been studied in solution using tracer techniques and no solid compounds have been prepared under normal conditions fermium exists in solution as the fm ion which has a hydration number of and an acid dissociation constant of pka fm forms complexes with a wide variety of organic ligands with hard donor atoms such as oxygen and these complexes are usually more stable than those of the preceding actinides it also forms anionic complexes with ligands such as chloride or nitrate and again these complexes appear to be more stable than those formed by einsteinium or californium it is believed that the bonding in the complexes of the later actinides is mostly ionic in character the fm ion is expected to be smaller than the preceding an ions because of the higher effective nuclear charge of fermium and hence fermium would be expected to form shorter and stronger metal ligand bonds fermium iii can be fairly easily reduced to fermium ii for example with samarium ii chloride with which fermium ii coprecipitates in the precipitate the compound fermium ii chloride fmcl was produced though it was not purified or studied in isolation the electrode potential has been estimated to be similar to that of the ytterbium iii ii couple or about v with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode a value which agrees with theoretical calculations the fm fm couple has an electrode potential of v based on polarographic measurements toxicity although few people come in contact with fermium the international commission on radiological protection has set annual exposure limits for the two most stable isotopes for fermium the ingestion limit was set at becquerels bq is equivalent to one decay per second and the inhalation limit at bq for fermium at bq and bq respectively ,100
Mendelevium,Md,mendelevium is a synthetic element with the symbol md formerly mv and atomic number a metallic radioactive transuranium element in the actinide series it is the first element by atomic number that currently cannot be produced in macroscopic quantities by neutron bombardment of lighter elements it is the third to last actinide and the ninth transuranic element it can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles seventeen isotopes are known the most stable is md with half life days however the shorter lived md half life hours is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale mendelevium was discovered by bombarding einsteinium with alpha particles in the method still used to produce it today it was named after dmitri mendeleev father of the periodic table of the chemical elements using available microgram quantities of einsteinium over a million mendelevium atoms may be made each hour the chemistry of mendelevium is typical for the late actinides with a preponderance of the oxidation state but also an accessible oxidation state all known isotopes of mendelevium have short half lives there are currently no uses for it outside basic scientific research and only small amounts are produced discovery mendelevium was the ninth transuranic element to be synthesized it was first synthesized by albert ghiorso glenn t seaborg gregory robert choppin bernard g harvey and team leader stanley g thompson in early at the university of california berkeley the team produced md half life of minutes when they bombarded an es target consisting of only a billion einsteinium atoms with alpha particles helium nuclei in the berkeley radiation laboratory s inch cyclotron thus increasing the target s atomic number by two md thus became the first isotope of any element to be synthesized one atom at a time in total seventeen mendelevium atoms were produced this discovery was part of a program begun in that irradiated plutonium with neutrons to transmute it into heavier actinides this method was necessary as the previous method used to synthesize transuranic elements neutron capture could not work because of a lack of known beta decaying isotopes of fermium that would produce isotopes of the next element mendelevium and also due to the very short half life to spontaneous fission of fm that thus constituted a hard limit to the success of the neutron capture process to predict if the production of mendelevium would be possible the team made use of a rough calculation the number of atoms that would be produced would be approximately equal to the product of the number of atoms of target material the target s cross section the ion beam intensity and the time of bombardment this last factor was related to the half life of the product when bombarding for a time on the order of its half life this gave one atom per experiment thus under optimum conditions the preparation of only one atom of element per experiment could be expected this calculation demonstrated that it was feasible to go ahead with the experiment the target material einsteinium could be produced readily from irradiating plutonium one year of irradiation would give a billion atoms and its three week half life meant that the element experiments could be conducted in one week after the produced einsteinium was separated and purified to make the target however it was necessary to upgrade the cyclotron to obtain the needed intensity of alpha particles per second seaborg applied for the necessary funds while seaborg applied for funding harvey worked on the einsteinium target while thomson and choppin focused on methods for chemical isolation choppin suggested using hydroxyisobutyric acid to separate the mendelevium atoms from those of the lighter actinides the actual synthesis was done by a recoil technique introduced by albert ghiorso in this technique the einsteinium was placed on the opposite side of the target from the beam so that the recoiling mendelevium atoms would get enough momentum to leave the target and be caught on a catcher foil made of gold this recoil target was made by an electroplating technique developed by alfred chetham strode this technique gave a very high yield which was absolutely necessary when working with such a rare and valuable product as the einsteinium target material the recoil target consisted of atoms of es which were deposited electrolytically on a thin gold foil it was bombarded by mev alpha particles in the berkeley cyclotron with a very high beam density of particles per second over an area of cm the target was cooled by water or liquid helium and the foil could be replaced initial experiments were carried out in september no alpha decay was seen from mendelevium atoms thus ghiorso suggested that the mendelevium had all decayed by electron capture to fermium and that the experiment should be repeated to search instead for spontaneous fission events the repetition of the experiment happened in february on the day of discovery february alpha irradiation of the einsteinium target occurred in three three hour sessions the cyclotron was in the university of california campus while the radiation laboratory was on the next hill to deal with this situation a complex procedure was used ghiorso took the catcher foils there were three targets and three foils from the cyclotron to harvey who would use aqua regia to dissolve it and pass it through an anion exchange resin column to separate out the transuranium elements from the gold and other products the resultant drops entered a test tube which choppin and ghiorso took in a car to get to the radiation laboratory as soon as possible there thompson and choppin used a cation exchange resin column and the hydroxyisobutyric acid the solution drops were collected on platinum disks and dried under heat lamps the three disks were expected to contain respectively the fermium no new elements and the mendelevium finally they were placed in their own counters which were connected to recorders such that spontaneous fission events would be recorded as huge deflections in a graph showing the number and time of the decays there thus was no direct detection but by observation of spontaneous fission events arising from its electron capture daughter fm the first one was identified with a hooray followed by a double hooray and a triple hooray the fourth one eventually officially proved the chemical identification of the st element mendelevium in total five decays were reported up until a m seaborg was notified and the team left to sleep additional analysis and further experimentation showed the produced mendelevium isotope to have mass and to decay by electron capture to fermium with a half life of h we thought it fitting that there be an element named for the russian chemist dmitri mendeleev who had developed the periodic table in nearly all our experiments discovering transuranium elements we d depended on his method of predicting chemical properties based on the element s position in the table but in the middle of the cold war naming an element for a russian was a somewhat bold gesture that did not sit well with some american critics being the first of the second hundred of the chemical elements it was decided that the element would be named mendelevium after the russian chemist dmitri mendeleev father of the periodic table because this discovery came during the cold war seaborg had to request permission of the government of the united states to propose that the element be named for a russian but it was granted the name mendelevium was accepted by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac in with symbol mv which was changed to md in the next iupac general assembly paris characteristics physical in the periodic table mendelevium is located to the right of the actinide fermium to the left of the actinide nobelium and below the lanthanide thulium mendelevium metal has not yet been prepared in bulk quantities and bulk preparation is currently impossible nevertheless a number of predictions and some preliminary experimental results have been done regarding its properties the lanthanides and actinides in the metallic state can exist as either divalent such as europium and ytterbium or trivalent most other lanthanides metals the former have fns configurations whereas the latter have fn d s configurations in johansson and rosengren examined the measured and predicted values for the cohesive energies enthalpies of crystallization of the metallic lanthanides and actinides both as divalent and trivalent metals the conclusion was that the increased binding energy of the rn f d s configuration over the rn f s configuration for mendelevium was not enough to compensate for the energy needed to promote one f electron to d as is true also for the very late actinides thus einsteinium fermium mendelevium and nobelium were expected to be divalent metals the increasing predominance of the divalent state well before the actinide series concludes is attributed to the relativistic stabilization of the f electrons which increases with increasing atomic number thermochromatographic studies with trace quantities of mendelevium by zvara and h bener from to confirmed this prediction in haire and gibson estimated mendelevium metal to have an enthalpy of sublimation between and kj mol divalent mendelevium metal should have a metallic radius of around pm like the other divalent late actinides except the once again trivalent lawrencium metallic mendelevium should assume a face centered cubic crystal structure mendelevium s melting point has been estimated at c the same value as that predicted for the neighboring element nobelium its density is predicted to be around g cm chemical the chemistry of mendelevium is mostly known only in solution in which it can take on the or oxidation states the state has also been reported but has not yet been confirmed before mendelevium s discovery seaborg and katz predicted that it should be predominantly trivalent in aqueous solution and hence should behave similarly to other tripositive lanthanides and actinides after the synthesis of mendelevium in these predictions were confirmed first in the observation at its discovery that it eluted just after fermium in the trivalent actinide elution sequence from a cation exchange column of resin and later the observation that mendelevium could form insoluble hydroxides and fluorides that coprecipitated with trivalent lanthanide salts cation exchange and solvent extraction studies led to the conclusion that mendelevium was a trivalent actinide with an ionic radius somewhat smaller than that of the previous actinide fermium mendelevium can form coordination complexes with cyclohexanedinitrilotetraacetic acid dcta in reducing conditions mendelevium iii can be easily reduced to mendelevium ii which is stable in aqueous solution the standard reduction potential of the e md md couple was variously estimated in as v or v later experiments established the value as v in comparison e md md should be around v and e md md should be around v mendelevium ii s elution behavior has been compared with that of strontium ii and europium ii in mendelevium i was reported to have been produced by russian scientists who obtained it by reducing higher oxidation states of mendelevium with samarium ii it was found to be stable in neutral water ethanol solution and be homologous to caesium i however later experiments found no evidence for mendelevium i and found that mendelevium behaved like divalent elements when reduced not like the monovalent alkali metals nevertheless the russian team conducted further studies on the thermodynamics of cocrystallizing mendelevium with alkali metal chlorides and concluded that mendelevium i had formed and could form mixed crystals with divalent elements thus cocrystallizing with them the status of the oxidation state is still tentative the electrode potential e md md was predicted in to be v experiments with the strong oxidizing agent sodium bismuthate were unable to oxidize mendelevium iii to mendelevium iv atomic a mendelevium atom has electrons of which at least three and perhaps four can act as valence electrons they are expected to be arranged in the configuration rn f s ground state term symbol f although experimental verification of this electron configuration had not yet been made as of in forming compounds three valence electrons may be lost leaving behind a rn f core this conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their rn fn electron configurations in the tripositive state the first ionization potential of mendelevium was measured to be at most ev in based on the assumption that the s electrons would ionize before the f ones this value has since not yet been refined further due to mendelevium s scarcity and high radioactivity the ionic radius of hexacoordinate md had been preliminarily estimated in to be around pm calculations based on the logarithmic trend between distribution coefficients and ionic radius produced a value of pm as well as an enthalpy of hydration of kj mol md should have an ionic radius of pm and hydration enthalpy kj mol md should have ionic radius pm isotopes seventeen isotopes of mendelevium are known with mass numbers from to all are radioactive additionally five nuclear isomers are known mmd mmd mmd mmd and mmd of these the longest lived isotope is md with a half life of days and the longest lived isomer is mmd with a half life of minutes nevertheless the shorter lived md half life hours is more often used in chemical experimentation because it can be produced in larger quantities from alpha particle irradiation of einsteinium after md the next most stable mendelevium isotopes are md with a half life of days md with a half life of hours md with a half life of hours and md with a half life of hours all of the remaining mendelevium isotopes have half lives that are less than an hour and the majority of these have half lives that are less than minutes the half lives of mendelevium isotopes mostly increase smoothly from md onwards reaching a maximum at md experiments and predictions suggest that the half lives will then decrease apart from md with a half life of days as spontaneous fission becomes the dominant decay mode due to the mutual repulsion of the protons posing a limit to the island of relative stability of long lived nuclei in the actinide series mendelevium the chemically most important isotope of mendelevium decays through electron capture of the time and alpha decay of the time it is most easily detected through the spontaneous fission of its electron capture daughter fermium but in the presence of other nuclides that undergo spontaneous fission alpha decays at the characteristic energies for mendelevium and mev can provide more useful identification production and isolation the lightest isotopes md to md are mostly produced through bombardment of bismuth targets with heavy argon ions while slightly heavier ones md to md are produced by bombarding plutonium and americium targets with ions of carbon and nitrogen the most important and most stable isotopes are in the range from md to md and are produced through bombardment of einsteinium with alpha particles einsteinium and can all be used md is produced as a daughter of no and md can be produced in a transfer reaction between einsteinium and oxygen typically the most commonly used isotope md is produced by bombarding either einsteinium or with alpha particles einsteinium is preferred when available because it has a longer half life and therefore can be used as a target for longer using available microgram quantities of einsteinium femtogram quantities of mendelevium may be produced the recoil momentum of the produced mendelevium atoms is used to bring them physically far away from the einsteinium target from which they are produced bringing them onto a thin foil of metal usually beryllium aluminium platinum or gold just behind the target in a vacuum this eliminates the need for immediate chemical separation which is both costly and prevents reusing of the expensive einsteinium target the mendelevium atoms are then trapped in a gas atmosphere frequently helium and a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber carries the mendelevium along using a long capillary tube and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas the mendelevium atoms can be transported over tens of meters to be chemically analyzed and have their quantity determined the mendelevium can then be separated from the foil material and other fission products by applying acid to the foil and then coprecipitating the mendelevium with lanthanum fluoride then using a cation exchange resin column with a ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid acting as an eluant however if the foil is made of gold and thin enough it is enough to simply dissolve the gold in aqua regia before separating the trivalent actinides from the gold using anion exchange chromatography the eluant being m hydrochloric acid mendelevium can finally be separated from the other trivalent actinides using selective elution from a cation exchange resin column the eluant being ammonia hib using the gas jet method often renders the first two steps unnecessary the above procedure is the most commonly used one for the separation of transeinsteinium elements another possible way to separate the trivalent actinides is via solvent extraction chromatography using bis ethylhexyl phosphoric acid abbreviated as hdehp as the stationary organic phase and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase the actinide elution sequence is reversed from that of the cation exchange resin column so that the heavier actinides elute later the mendelevium separated by this method has the advantage of being free of organic complexing agent compared to the resin column the disadvantage is that mendelevium then elutes very late in the elution sequence after fermium another method to isolate mendelevium exploits the distinct elution properties of md from those of es and fm the initial steps are the same as above and employs hdehp for extraction chromatography but coprecipitates the mendelevium with terbium fluoride instead of lanthanum fluoride then mg of chromium is added to the mendelevium to reduce it to the state in m hydrochloric acid with zinc or mercury the solvent extraction then proceeds and while the trivalent and tetravalent lanthanides and actinides remain on the column mendelevium ii does not and stays in the hydrochloric acid it is then reoxidized to the state using hydrogen peroxide and then isolated by selective elution with m hydrochloric acid to remove impurities including chromium and finally m hydrochloric acid to remove the mendelevium it is also possible to use a column of cationite and zinc amalgam using m hydrochloric acid as an eluant reducing md iii to md ii where it behaves like the alkaline earth metals thermochromatographic chemical isolation could be achieved using the volatile mendelevium hexafluoroacetylacetonate the analogous fermium compound is also known and is also volatile toxicity though few people come in contact with mendelevium the international commission on radiological protection has set annual exposure limits for the most stable isotope for mendelevium the ingestion limit was set at becquerels bq decay per second given the half life of this isotope this is only ng nanograms the inhalation limit is at bq or pg picogram ,101
Nobelium,No,nobelium is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol no and atomic number it is named in honor of alfred nobel the inventor of dynamite and benefactor of science a radioactive metal it is the tenth transuranic element and is the penultimate member of the actinide series like all elements with atomic number over nobelium can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles a total of twelve nobelium isotopes are known to exist the most stable is no with a half life of minutes but the shorter lived no half life minutes is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale chemistry experiments have confirmed that nobelium behaves as a heavier homolog to ytterbium in the periodic table the chemical properties of nobelium are not completely known they are mostly only known in aqueous solution before nobelium s discovery it was predicted that it would show a stable oxidation state as well as the state characteristic of the other actinides these predictions were later confirmed as the state is much more stable than the state in aqueous solution and it is difficult to keep nobelium in the state in the s and s many claims of the discovery of nobelium were made from laboratories in sweden the soviet union and the united states although the swedish scientists soon retracted their claims the priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between soviet and american scientists and it was not until that the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac credited the soviet team with the discovery but retained nobelium the swedish proposal as the name of the element due to its long standing use in the literature introduction the heaviest atomic nuclei are created in nuclear reactions that combine two other nuclei of unequal size into one roughly the more unequal the two nuclei in terms of mass the greater the possibility that the two react the material made of the heavier nuclei is made into a target which is then bombarded by the beam of lighter nuclei two nuclei can only fuse into one if they approach each other closely enough normally nuclei all positively charged repel each other due to electrostatic repulsion the strong interaction can overcome this repulsion but only within a very short distance from a nucleus beam nuclei are thus greatly accelerated in order to make such repulsion insignificant compared to the velocity of the beam nucleus coming close alone is not enough for two nuclei to fuse when two nuclei approach each other they usually remain together for approximately seconds and then part ways not necessarily in the same composition as before the reaction rather than form a single nucleus if fusion does occur the temporary merger termed a compound nucleus is an excited state to lose its excitation energy and reach a more stable state a compound nucleus either fissions or ejects one or several neutrons which carry away the energy this occurs in approximately seconds after the initial collision the beam passes through the target and reaches the next chamber the separator if a new nucleus is produced it is carried with this beam in the separator the newly produced nucleus is separated from other nuclides that of the original beam and any other reaction products and transferred to a surface barrier detector which stops the nucleus the exact location of the upcoming impact on the detector is marked also marked are its energy and the time of the arrival the transfer takes about seconds in order to be detected the nucleus must survive this long the nucleus is recorded again once its decay is registered and the location the energy and the time of the decay are measured stability of a nucleus is provided by the strong interaction however its range is very short as nuclei become larger their influence on the outermost nucleons protons and neutrons weakens at the same time the nucleus is torn apart by electrostatic repulsion between protons as it has unlimited range nuclei of the heaviest elements are thus theoretically predicted and have so far been observed to primarily decay via decay modes that are caused by such repulsion alpha decay and spontaneous fission these modes are predominant for nuclei of superheavy elements alpha decays are registered by the emitted alpha particles and the decay products are easy to determine before the actual decay if such a decay or a series of consecutive decays produces a known nucleus the original product of a reaction can be determined arithmetically spontaneous fission however produces various nuclei as products so the original nuclide cannot be determined from its daughters the information available to physicists aiming to synthesize one of the heaviest elements is thus the information collected at the detectors location energy and time of arrival of a particle to the detector and those of its decay the physicists analyze this data and seek to conclude that it was indeed caused by a new element and could not have been caused by a different nuclide than the one claimed often provided data is insufficient for a conclusion that a new element was definitely created and there is no other explanation for the observed effects errors in interpreting data have been made discovery the discovery of element was a complicated process and was claimed by groups from sweden the united states and the soviet union the first complete and incontrovertible report of its detection only came in from the joint institute of nuclear research at dubna then in the soviet union the first announcement of the discovery of element was announced by physicists at the nobel institute in sweden in the team reported that they had bombarded a curium target with carbon ions for twenty five hours in half hour intervals between bombardments ion exchange chemistry was performed on the target twelve out of the fifty bombardments contained samples emitting mev alpha particles which were in drops which eluted earlier than fermium atomic number z and californium z the half life reported was minutes and was assigned to either or although the possibility that the alpha particles observed were from a presumably short lived mendelevium z isotope created from the electron capture of element was not excluded the team proposed the name nobelium no for the new element which was immediately approved by iupac a decision which the dubna group characterized in as being hasty in scientists at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory repeated the experiment the berkeley team consisting of albert ghiorso glenn t seaborg john r walton and torbj rn sikkeland used the new heavy ion linear accelerator hilac to bombard a curium target cm and cm with c and c ions they were unable to confirm the mev activity claimed by the swedes but were instead able to detect decays from fermium supposedly the daughter of produced from the curium which had an apparent half life of s in the swedish team attempted to explain the berkeley team s inability to detect element in maintaining that they did discover it however later work has shown that no nobelium isotopes lighter than no no heavier isotopes could have been produced in the swedish experiments with a half life over minutes exist and that the swedish team s results are most likely from thorium which has a half life of minutes and quickly undergoes triple alpha decay to polonium which has a decay energy of mev this hypothesis is lent weight by the fact that thorium can easily be produced in the reaction used and would not be separated out by the chemical methods used later work on nobelium also showed that the divalent state is more stable than the trivalent one and hence that the samples emitting the alpha particles could not have contained nobelium as the divalent nobelium would not have eluted with the other trivalent actinides thus the swedish team later retracted their claim and associated the activity to background effects later dubna work confirmed that could be produced in this reaction but that its half life was actually s in the berkeley team attempted to defend their work stating that the isotope found was indeed fm but the isotope that the half life measurements actually related to was californium granddaughter of produced from the more abundant curium energy differences were then attributed to resolution and drift problems although these had not been previously reported and should also have influenced other results experiments showed that indeed had a second half life however work also showed that the fm recoil could have also easily been produced from the isomeric transition of mfm half life s which could also have been formed in the reaction at the energy used given this it is probable that no nobelium was actually produced in this experiment in the team continued their studies and claimed that they were able to produce an isotope that decayed predominantly by emission of an mev alpha particle with a half life of s with an associated spontaneous fission branch the activity was initially assigned to but later changed to however they also noted that it was not certain that nobelium had been produced due to difficult conditions the berkeley team decided to adopt the proposed name of the swedish team nobelium for the element cm c no no nmeanwhile in dubna experiments were carried out in and aiming to synthesize element as well the first experiment bombarded plutonium and with oxygen ions some alpha decays with energies just over mev were observed and they were assigned to although the team wrote that formation of isotopes from lead or bismuth impurities which would not produce nobelium could not be ruled out while later experiments noted that new isotopes could be produced from mercury thallium lead or bismuth impurities the scientists still stood by their conclusion that element could be produced from this reaction mentioning a half life of under seconds and a decay energy of mev later experiments proved that these were background effects experiments also lowered the decay energy to mev but both values are too high to possibly match those of no or no the dubna team later stated in and again in that these results were not conclusive in berkeley scientists claimed the discovery of element in the reaction of californium with boron and carbon ions they claimed the production of the isotope and also claimed to have synthesized an alpha decaying isotope of element that had a half life of s and alpha decay energy mev they assigned this to without giving a reason for the assignment the values do not agree with those now known for no although they do agree with those now known for no and while this isotope probably played a part in this experiment its discovery was inconclusive work on element also continued in dubna and in experiments were carried out there to detect alpha decay daughters of element isotopes by synthesizing element from the reaction of a uranium target with neon ions the products were carried along a silver catcher foil and purified chemically and the isotopes fm and fm were detected the yield of fm was interpreted as evidence that its parent was also synthesized as it was noted that fm could also be produced directly in this reaction by the simultaneous emission of an alpha particle with the excess neutrons steps were taken to ensure that fm could not go directly to the catcher foil the half life detected for was s which is much higher than the more modern value of s further experiments were conducted in for using the reactions am n n and u ne n finding a half life of s at that time the discrepancy between this value and the earlier berkeley value was not understood although later work proved that the formation of the isomer mfm was less likely in the dubna experiments than at the berkeley ones in hindsight the dubna results on were probably correct and can be now considered a conclusive detection of element one more very convincing experiment from dubna was published in again using the same two reactions which concluded that indeed had a half life much longer than the seconds claimed by berkeley later work in at berkeley and at the oak ridge national laboratory fully confirmed the discovery of element and clarified earlier observations in december the berkeley group repeated the dubna experiments and fully confirmed them and used this data to finally assign correctly the isotopes they had previously synthesized but could not yet identify at the time and thus claimed to have discovered nobelium in to u ne no no nin the dubna team carried out chemical experiments on element and concluded that it behaved as the heavier homologue of ytterbium the russian scientists proposed the name joliotium jo for the new element after ir ne joliot curie who had recently died creating an element naming controversy that would not be resolved for several decades which each group using its own proposed names in the iupac iupap transfermium working group twg reassessed the claims of discovery and concluded that only the dubna work from correctly detected and assigned decays to nuclei with atomic number at the time the dubna team are therefore officially recognised as the discoverers of nobelium although it is possible that it was detected at berkeley in this decision was criticized by berkeley the following year calling the reopening of the cases of elements to a futile waste of time while dubna agreed with iupac s decision in as part of an attempted resolution to the element naming controversy iupac ratified names for elements for element it ratified the name nobelium no on the basis that it had become entrenched in the literature over the course of years and that alfred nobel should be commemorated in this fashion because of outcry over the names which mostly did not respect the choices of the discoverers a comment period ensued and in iupac named element flerovium fl as part of a new proposal after either georgy flyorov or his eponymous flerov laboratory of nuclear reactions this proposal was also not accepted and in the name nobelium was restored today the name flerovium with the same symbol refers to element characteristics physical in the periodic table nobelium is located to the right of the actinide mendelevium to the left of the actinide lawrencium and below the lanthanide ytterbium nobelium metal has not yet been prepared in bulk quantities and bulk preparation is currently impossible nevertheless a number of predictions and some preliminary experimental results have been done regarding its properties the lanthanides and actinides in the metallic state can exist as either divalent such as europium and ytterbium or trivalent most other lanthanides metals the former have fns configurations whereas the latter have fn d s configurations in johansson and rosengren examined the measured and predicted values for the cohesive energies enthalpies of crystallization of the metallic lanthanides and actinides both as divalent and trivalent metals the conclusion was that the increased binding energy of the rn f d s configuration over the rn f s configuration for nobelium was not enough to compensate for the energy needed to promote one f electron to d as is true also for the very late actinides thus einsteinium fermium mendelevium and nobelium were expected to be divalent metals although for nobelium this prediction has not yet been confirmed the increasing predominance of the divalent state well before the actinide series concludes is attributed to the relativistic stabilization of the f electrons which increases with increasing atomic number an effect of this is that nobelium is predominantly divalent instead of trivalent unlike all the other lanthanides and actinides in nobelium metal was estimated to have an enthalpy of sublimation between kj mol a value close to the values for einsteinium fermium and mendelevium and supporting the theory that nobelium would form a divalent metal like the other divalent late actinides except the once again trivalent lawrencium metallic nobelium should assume a face centered cubic crystal structure divalent nobelium metal should have a metallic radius of around pm nobelium s melting point has been predicted to be c the same value as that estimated for the neighboring element mendelevium its density is predicted to be around g cm chemical the chemistry of nobelium is incompletely characterized and is known only in aqueous solution in which it can take on the or oxidation states the latter being more stable it was largely expected before the discovery of nobelium that in solution it would behave like the other actinides with the trivalent state being predominant however seaborg predicted in that the state would also be relatively stable for nobelium as the no ion would have the ground state electron configuration rn f including the stable filled f shell it took nineteen years before this prediction was confirmed in experiments were conducted to compare nobelium s chemical behavior to that of terbium californium and fermium all four elements were reacted with chlorine and the resulting chlorides were deposited along a tube along which they were carried by a gas it was found that the nobelium chloride produced was strongly adsorbed on solid surfaces proving that it was not very volatile like the chlorides of the other three investigated elements however both nocl and nocl were expected to exhibit nonvolatile behavior and hence this experiment was inconclusive as to what the preferred oxidation state of nobelium was determination of nobelium s favoring of the state had to wait until the next year when cation exchange chromatography and coprecipitation experiments were carried out on around fifty thousand no atoms finding that it behaved differently from the other actinides and more like the divalent alkaline earth metals this proved that in aqueous solution nobelium is most stable in the divalent state when strong oxidizers are absent later experimentation in showed that nobelium eluted with the alkaline earth metals between ca and sr nobelium is the only known f block element for which the state is the most common and stable one in aqueous solution this occurs because of the large energy gap between the f and d orbitals at the end of the actinide series it is expected that the relativistic stabilization of the s subshell greatly destabilizes nobelium dihydride noh and relativistic stabilisation of the p spinor over the d spinor mean that excited states in nobelium atoms have s and p contribution instead of the expected d contribution the long no h distances in the noh molecule and the significant charge transfer lead to extreme ionicity with a dipole moment of d for this molecule in this molecule nobelium is expected to exhibit main group like behavior specifically acting like an alkaline earth metal with its ns valence shell configuration and core like f orbitals nobelium s complexing ability with chloride ions is most similar to that of barium which complexes rather weakly its complexing ability with citrate oxalate and acetate in an aqueous solution of m ammonium nitrate is between that of calcium and strontium although it is somewhat closer to that of strontium the standard reduction potential of the e no no couple was estimated in to be between and v it was later found in to be only about v the positive value shows that no is more stable than no and that no is a good oxidizing agent while the quoted values for the e no no and e no no vary among sources the accepted standard estimates are and v it has been predicted that the value for the e no no couple would be v the gibbs energies of formation for no and no are estimated to be and kj mol respectively atomic a nobelium atom has electrons of which three can act as valence electrons they are expected to be arranged in the configuration rn f s ground state term symbol s although experimental verification of this electron configuration had not yet been made as of in forming compounds all the three valence electrons may be lost leaving behind a rn f core this conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their rn fn electron configurations in the tripositive state nevertheless it is more likely that only two valence electrons may be lost leaving behind a stable rn f core with a filled f shell the first ionization potential of nobelium was measured to be at most ev in based on the assumption that the s electrons would ionize before the f ones this value has not yet been refined further due to nobelium s scarcity and high radioactivity the ionic radius of hexacoordinate and octacoordinate no had been preliminarily estimated in to be around and pm respectively the ionic radius of no has been experimentally found to be pm to two significant figures the enthalpy of hydration of no has been calculated as kj mol isotopes thirteen isotopes of nobelium are known with mass numbers and all are radioactive additionally nuclear isomers are known for mass numbers and of these the longest lived isotope is no with a half life of minutes and the longest lived isomer is mno with a half life of seconds however the still undiscovered isotope no is predicted to have a still longer half life of min additionally the shorter lived no half life minutes is more often used in chemical experimentation because it can be produced in larger quantities from irradiation of californium with carbon ions after no and no the next most stable nobelium isotopes are no half life minutes no seconds no seconds no seconds and no seconds all of the remaining nobelium isotopes have half lives that are less than a second and the shortest lived known nobelium isotope no has a half life of only milliseconds the isotope no is especially interesting theoretically as it is in the middle of a series of prolate nuclei from pa to rg and the formation of its nuclear isomers of which two are known is controlled by proton orbitals such as f which come just above the spherical proton shell it can be synthesized in the reaction of pb with ca the half lives of nobelium isotopes increase smoothly from no to no however a dip appears at no and beyond this the half lives of even even nobelium isotopes drop sharply as spontaneous fission becomes the dominant decay mode for example the half life of no is almost three seconds but that of no is only milliseconds this shows that at nobelium the mutual repulsion of protons poses a limit to the region of long lived nuclei in the actinide series the even odd nobelium isotopes mostly continue to have longer half lives as their mass numbers increase with a dip in the trend at no preparation and purification the isotopes of nobelium are mostly produced by bombarding actinide targets uranium plutonium curium californium or einsteinium with the exception of nobelium which is produced as the daughter of lawrencium the most commonly used isotope no can be produced from bombarding curium or californium with carbon the latter method is more common irradiating a g cm target of californium with three trillion mev carbon ions per second for ten minutes can produce around nobelium atoms once the nobelium is produced it can be separated out similarly as used to purify the neighboring actinide mendelevium the recoil momentum of the produced nobelium atoms is used to bring them physically far away from the target from which they are produced bringing them onto a thin foil of metal usually beryllium aluminium platinum or gold just behind the target in a vacuum this is usually combined by trapping the nobelium atoms in a gas atmosphere frequently helium and carrying them along with a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber using a long capillary tube and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas the nobelium atoms can be transported over tens of meters the thin layer of nobelium collected on the foil can then be removed with dilute acid without completely dissolving the foil the nobelium can then be isolated by exploiting its tendency to form the divalent state unlike the other trivalent actinides under typically used elution conditions bis ethylhexyl phosphoric acid hdehp as stationary organic phase and m hydrochloric acid as mobile aqueous phase or using m hydrochloric acid as an eluant from cation exchange resin columns nobelium will pass through the column and elute while the other trivalent actinides remain on the column however if a direct catcher gold foil is used the process is complicated by the need to separate out the gold using anion exchange chromatography before isolating the nobelium by elution from chromatographic extraction columns using hdehp ,102
Lawrencium,Lr,lawrencium is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol lr formerly lw and atomic number it is named in honor of ernest lawrence inventor of the cyclotron a device that was used to discover many artificial radioactive elements a radioactive metal lawrencium is the eleventh transuranic element and the last member of the actinide series like all elements with atomic number over lawrencium can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles fourteen isotopes of lawrencium are currently known the most stable is lr with half life hours but the shorter lived lr half life minutes is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale chemistry experiments confirm that lawrencium behaves as a heavier homolog to lutetium in the periodic table and is a trivalent element it thus could also be classified as the first of the th period transition metals however its electron configuration is anomalous for its position in the periodic table having an s p configuration instead of the s d configuration of its homolog lutetium this means that lawrencium may be more volatile than expected for its position in the periodic table and have a volatility comparable to that of lead in the s s and s many claims of the synthesis of lawrencium of varying quality were made from laboratories in the soviet union and the united states the priority of the discovery and therefore the name of the element was disputed between soviet and american scientists and while the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac initially established lawrencium as the official name for the element and gave the american team credit for the discovery this was reevaluated in giving both teams shared credit for the discovery but not changing the element s name introduction the heaviest atomic nuclei are created in nuclear reactions that combine two other nuclei of unequal size into one roughly the more unequal the two nuclei in terms of mass the greater the possibility that the two react the material made of the heavier nuclei is made into a target which is then bombarded by the beam of lighter nuclei two nuclei can only fuse into one if they approach each other closely enough normally nuclei all positively charged repel each other due to electrostatic repulsion the strong interaction can overcome this repulsion but only within a very short distance from a nucleus beam nuclei are thus greatly accelerated in order to make such repulsion insignificant compared to the velocity of the beam nucleus coming close alone is not enough for two nuclei to fuse when two nuclei approach each other they usually remain together for approximately seconds and then part ways not necessarily in the same composition as before the reaction rather than form a single nucleus if fusion does occur the temporary merger termed a compound nucleus is an excited state to lose its excitation energy and reach a more stable state a compound nucleus either fissions or ejects one or several neutrons which carry away the energy this occurs in approximately seconds after the initial collision the beam passes through the target and reaches the next chamber the separator if a new nucleus is produced it is carried with this beam in the separator the newly produced nucleus is separated from other nuclides that of the original beam and any other reaction products and transferred to a surface barrier detector which stops the nucleus the exact location of the upcoming impact on the detector is marked also marked are its energy and the time of the arrival the transfer takes about seconds in order to be detected the nucleus must survive this long the nucleus is recorded again once its decay is registered and the location the energy and the time of the decay are measured stability of a nucleus is provided by the strong interaction however its range is very short as nuclei become larger their influence on the outermost nucleons protons and neutrons weakens at the same time the nucleus is torn apart by electrostatic repulsion between protons as it has unlimited range nuclei of the heaviest elements are thus theoretically predicted and have so far been observed to primarily decay via decay modes that are caused by such repulsion alpha decay and spontaneous fission these modes are predominant for nuclei of superheavy elements alpha decays are registered by the emitted alpha particles and the decay products are easy to determine before the actual decay if such a decay or a series of consecutive decays produces a known nucleus the original product of a reaction can be determined arithmetically spontaneous fission however produces various nuclei as products so the original nuclide cannot be determined from its daughters the information available to physicists aiming to synthesize one of the heaviest elements is thus the information collected at the detectors location energy and time of arrival of a particle to the detector and those of its decay the physicists analyze this data and seek to conclude that it was indeed caused by a new element and could not have been caused by a different nuclide than the one claimed often provided data is insufficient for a conclusion that a new element was definitely created and there is no other explanation for the observed effects errors in interpreting data have been made history in scientists at lawrence berkeley national laboratory claimed the discovery of element now called nobelium at the same time they also tried to synthesize element by bombarding the same curium target used with nitrogen ions eighteen tracks were noted with decay energy around mev and half life around s the berkeley team noted that while the cause could be the production of an isotope of element other possibilities could not be ruled out while the data agrees reasonably with that later discovered for lr alpha decay energy mev half life s the evidence obtained in this experiment fell far short of the strength required to conclusively demonstrate synthesis of element a follow up on this experiment was not done as the target was destroyed later in the lawrence berkeley laboratory attempted to synthesize the element by bombarding cf with b and b the results of this experiment were not conclusive the first important work on element was done at berkeley by the nuclear physics team of albert ghiorso torbj rn sikkeland almon larsh robert m latimer and their co workers on february the first atoms of lawrencium were reportedly made by bombarding a three milligram target consisting of three isotopes of californium with boron and boron nuclei from the heavy ion linear accelerator hilac the berkeley team reported that the isotope was detected in this manner and that it decayed by emitting an mev alpha particle with a half life of s this identification was later corrected to as later work proved that lr did not have the properties detected but lr did this was considered at the time to be convincing proof of synthesis of element while the mass assignment was less certain and proved to be mistaken it did not affect the arguments in favor of element having been synthesized scientists at joint institute for nuclear research in dubna then in the soviet union raised several criticisms all but one were answered adequately the exception was that cf was the most common isotope in the target and in the reactions with b lr could only have been produced by emitting four neutrons and emitting three neutrons was expected to be much less likely than emitting four or five this would lead to a narrow yield curve not the broad one reported by the berkeley team a possible explanation was that there was a low number of events attributed to element this was an important intermediate step to the unquestioned discovery of element although the evidence was not completely convincing the berkeley team proposed the name lawrencium with symbol lw after ernest lawrence inventor of the cyclotron the iupac commission on nomenclature of inorganic chemistry accepted the name but changed the symbol to lr this acceptance of the discovery was later characterized as being hasty by the dubna team cf b lr lr nthe first work at dubna on element came in when they reported to have made in by bombarding am with o identifying it indirectly from its granddaughter fermium the half life they reported was somewhat too high possibly due to background events later work on the same reaction identified two decay energies in the ranges mev and mev these were assigned to and despite repeat attempts they were unable to confirm assignment of an alpha emitter with a half life of seconds to the russians proposed the name rutherfordium for the new element in this name was later proposed by berkeley for element am o lr lr nfurther experiments in at dubna and in at berkeley demonstrated an actinide chemistry for the new element so by it was known that element is the last actinide in the dubna group reported the synthesis of with half life s and alpha decay energy mev however it was not until when the nuclear physics team at university of california at berkeley successfully did a whole series of experiments aimed at measuring the nuclear decay properties of the lawrencium isotopes with mass numbers to that all previous results from berkeley and dubna were confirmed apart from the berkeley s group initial erroneous assignment of their first produced isotope to instead of the probably correct all final doubts were dispelled in and when the energies of x rays emitted from were measured in the iupac granted the discovery of lawrencium to the lawrence berkeley laboratory even though they did not have ideal data for the element s existence but in the iupac transfermium working group twg officially recognized the nuclear physics teams at dubna and berkeley as co discoverers of lawrencium concluding that while the berkeley experiments were an important step to lawrencium s discovery they were not yet fully convincing and while the and dubna experiments came very close to the needed level of confidence taken together only the berkeley experiments which clarified and confirmed previous observations finally resulted in complete confidence in the discovery of element because the name lawrencium had been in use for a long time by this point it was retained by iupac and in august the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac ratified the name lawrencium and the symbol lr during a meeting in geneva characteristics physical lawrencium is the last actinide among those who study the matter it is generally considered a group element along with scandium yttrium and lutetium as its filled f shell is expected to make it resemble the th period transition metals though there has been some dispute on this point in the periodic table it is to the right of the actinide nobelium to the left of the d transition metal rutherfordium and under the lanthanide lutetium with which it shares many physical and chemical properties lawrencium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and have a hexagonal close packed crystal structure c a similar to its lighter congener lutetium though this is not yet known experimentally the enthalpy of sublimation of lawrencium is estimated at kj mol close to the value of lutetium and strongly suggesting that metallic lawrencium is trivalent with three electrons delocalized a prediction also supported by a systematic extrapolation of the values of heat of vaporization bulk modulus and atomic volume of neighboring elements to lawrencium this makes it unlike the immediately preceding late actinides which are known to be fermium and mendelevium or expected to be nobelium divalent the estimated enthalpies of vaporization show that lawrencium deviates from the trend of the late actinides and instead matches the trend of the succeeding d elements rutherfordium and dubnium consistent with lawrencium s interpretation as a group element specifically lawrencium is expected to be a trivalent silvery metal easily oxidized by air steam and acids and having an atomic volume similar to that of lutetium and a trivalent metallic radius of pm it is expected to be a rather heavy metal with a density of around g cm it is also predicted to have a melting point of around k c not far from the value for lutetium k chemical in glenn t seaborg who devised the actinide concept predicted that element lawrencium should be the last actinide and that the lr ion should be about as stable as lu in aqueous solution it was not until decades later that element was finally conclusively synthesized and this prediction was experimentally confirmed studies on the element showed that lawrencium reacts with chlorine to form a product that was most likely the trichloride lrcl its volatility was found to be similar to the chlorides of curium fermium and nobelium and much less than that of rutherfordium chloride in chemical studies were performed on atoms of lr comparing it with divalent no ba ra trivalent fm cf cm am ac and tetravalent th pu elements it was found that lawrencium coextracted with the trivalent ions but the short half life of lr precluded a confirmation that it eluted ahead of md in the elution sequence lawrencium occurs as the trivalent lr ion in aqueous solution and hence its compounds should be similar to those of the other trivalent actinides for example lawrencium iii fluoride lrf and hydroxide lr oh should both be insoluble in water due to the actinide contraction the ionic radius of lr should be smaller than that of md and it should elute ahead of md when ammonium hydroxyisobutyrate ammonium hib is used as an eluant later experiments on the longer lived isotope lr confirmed lawrencium s trivalency and that it eluted in roughly the same place as erbium and found that lawrencium s ionic radius was pm larger than would be expected from simple extrapolation from periodic trends later experiments with more lawrencium atoms refined this to pm and calculated an enthalpy of hydration value of kj mol it was also found that the actinide contraction at the end of the actinides was larger than the analogous lanthanide contraction with the exception of the last actinide lawrencium the cause was speculated to be relativistic effects it has been speculated that the s electrons are relativistically stabilized so that in reducing conditions only the p electron would be ionized leading to the monovalent lr ion however all experiments to reduce lr to lr or lr in aqueous solution were unsuccessful similarly to lutetium on the basis of this the standard electrode potential of the e lr lr couple was calculated to be less than v indicating that the existence of lr ions in aqueous solution was unlikely the upper limit for the e lr lr couple was predicted to be v the values for e lr lr and e lr lr are predicted to be v and v the stability of the group oxidation state in the d transition series decreases as rfiv dbv sgvi and lawrencium continues the trend with lriii being more stable than rfiv in the molecule lawrencium dihydride lrh which is predicted to be bent the d orbital of lawrencium is not expected to play a role in the bonding unlike that of lanthanum dihydride lah lah has la h bond distances of while lrh should have shorter lr h bond distances of due to the relativistic contraction and stabilization of the s and p orbitals involved in the bonding in contrast to the core like f subshell and the mostly uninvolved d subshell in general molecular lrh and lrh are expected to resemble the corresponding thallium species thallium having a s p valence configuration in the gas phase like lawrencium s s p more than the corresponding lanthanide species the electron configurations of lr and lr are expected to be s and s respectively unlike the lanthanides which tend to be d as ln however in species where all three valence electrons of lawrencium are ionized to give at least formally the lr cation lawrencium is expected to behave like a typical actinide and the heavier congener of lutetium especially because the first three ionization potentials of lawrencium are predicted to be similar to those of lutetium hence unlike thallium but like lutetium lawrencium would prefer to form lrh than lrh and lrco is expected to be similar to the also unknown luco both metals having valence configuration in their monocarbonyls the p d bond is expected to be seen in lrcl just as it is for lucl and more generally all the lncl and the complex anion lr c h sime is expected to be stable just like its lanthanide congeners with a configuration of d for lawrencium this d orbital would be its highest occupied molecular orbital atomic lawrencium has three valence electrons in it was predicted that the ground state electron configuration of lawrencium was rn f d s ground state term symbol d per the aufbau principle and conforming to the xe f d s configuration of lawrencium s lighter homolog lutetium but the next year calculations were published that questioned this prediction instead expecting an anomalous rn f s p configuration though early calculations gave conflicting results more recent studies and calculations confirm the s p suggestion relativistic calculations concluded that the energy difference between the two configurations was small and that it was uncertain which was the ground state later calculations concluded that the s p configuration should be energetically favored because the spherical s and p orbitals are nearest to the atomic nucleus and thus move quickly enough that their relativistic mass increases significantly in a team of scientists led by eichler calculated that lawrencium s enthalpy of adsorption on metal sources would differ enough depending on its electron configuration that it would be feasible to carry out experiments to exploit this fact to measure lawrencium s electron configuration the s p configuration was expected to be more volatile than the s d configuration and be more similar to that of the p block element lead no evidence for lawrencium being volatile was obtained and the lower limit for the enthalpy of adsorption of lawrencium on quartz or platinum was significantly higher than the estimated value for the s p configuration in the first ionization energy of lawrencium was measured using the isotope lr the measured value ev agreed very well with the relativistic theoretical prediction of ev and also provided a first step into measuring the first ionization energies of the transactinides this value is the lowest among all the lanthanides and actinides and supports the s p configuration as the p electron is expected to be only weakly bound as ionisation energies generally increase left to right in the f block this low value suggests that lutetium and lawrencium belong in the d block whose trend they follow and not the f block and hence that they are the true heavier congeners of scandium and yttrium rather than lanthanum and actinium although some alkali metal like behaviour has been predicted adsorption experiments suggest that lawrencium is trivalent like scandium and yttrium not monovalent like the alkali metals a lower limit on lawrencium s second ionization energy ev was experimentally found in isotopes fourteen isotopes of lawrencium are known with mass number and all are radioactive one nuclear isomer is known with mass number the longest lived isotope lr has a half life of about ten hours and is one of the longest lived superheavy isotopes known to date however shorter lived isotopes are usually used in chemical experiments because lr currently can only be produced as a final decay product of even heavier and harder to make elements it was discovered in in the decay chain of ts lr half life seconds was used in the first chemical studies on lawrencium currently the longer lived lr half life minutes is usually used for this purpose after lr the longest lived isotopes are lr h lr h and lr min all other known lawrencium isotopes have half lives under minutes and the shortest lived of them lr has a half life of milliseconds the half lives of lawrencium isotopes mostly increase smoothly from lr to lr with a dip from lr to lr preparation and purification while the lightest lr to lr and heaviest lr and lr lawrencium isotopes are produced only as alpha decay products of dubnium z isotopes the middle isotopes lr to lr can be produced by bombarding actinide americium to einsteinium targets with light ions from boron to neon the two most important isotopes lr and lr are both in this range lr can be produced by bombarding californium with mev boron ions producing lawrencium and four neutrons while lr can be produced by bombarding berkelium with oxygen producing lawrencium an alpha particle and three neutrons both lr and lr have half lives too short to allow a complete chemical purification process early experiments with lr therefore used rapid solvent extraction with the chelating agent thenoyltrifluoroacetone tta dissolved in methyl isobutyl ketone mibk as the organic phase and with the aqueous phase being buffered acetate solutions ions of different charge or will then extract into the organic phase under different ph ranges but this method will not separate the trivalent actinides and thus lr must be identified by its emitted mev alpha particles more recent methods have allowed rapid selective elution with hib to take place in enough time to separate out the longer lived isotope lr which can be removed from the catcher foil with m hydrochloric acid ,103
Rutherfordium,Rf,rutherfordium is a chemical element with the symbol rf and atomic number named after new zealand born british physicist ernest rutherford as a synthetic element it is not found in nature and can only be made in a laboratory it is radioactive the most stable known isotope rf has a half life of hours in the periodic table it is a d block element and the second of the fourth row transition elements it is in period and is a group element chemistry experiments have confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as the heavier homolog to hafnium in group the chemical properties of rutherfordium are characterized only partly they compare well with the other group elements even though some calculations had indicated that the element might show significantly different properties due to relativistic effects in the s small amounts of rutherfordium were produced at joint institute for nuclear research in the soviet union and at lawrence berkeley national laboratory in california priority of discovery and hence the name of the element was disputed between soviet and american scientists and it was not until that the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac

separated from other nuclides that of the original beam and any other reaction products and transferred to a surface barrier detector which stops the nucleus the exact location of the upcoming impact on the detector is marked also marked are its energy and the time of the arrival the transfer takes about seconds in order to be detected the nucleus must survive this long the nucleus is recorded again once its decay is registered and the location the energy and the time of the decay are measured stability of a nucleus is provided by the strong interaction however its range is very short as nuclei become larger their influence on the outermost nucleons protons and neutrons weakens at the same time the nucleus is torn apart by electrostatic repulsion between protons as it has unlimited range nuclei of the heaviest elements are thus theoretically predicted and have so far been observed to primarily decay via decay modes that are caused by such repulsion alpha decay and spontaneous fission these modes are predominant for nuclei of superheavy elements alpha decays are registered by the emitted alpha particles and the decay products are easy to determine before the actual decay if such a decay or a series of consecutive decays produces a known nucleus the original product of a reaction can be determined arithmetically spontaneous fission however produces various nuclei as products so the original nuclide cannot be determined from its daughters the information available to physicists aiming to synthesize one of the heaviest elements is thus the information collected at the detectors location energy and time of arrival of a particle to the detector and those of its decay the physicists analyze this data and seek to conclude that it was indeed caused by a new element and could not have been caused by a different nuclide than the one claimed often provided data is insufficient for a conclusion that a new element was definitely created and there is no other explanation for the observed effects errors in interpreting data have been made history discovery rutherfordium was reportedly first detected in at joint institute for nuclear research at dubna soviet union at the time researchers there bombarded a plutonium target with neon ions and separated the reaction products by gradient thermochromatography after conversion to chlorides by interaction with zrcl the team identified spontaneous fission activity contained within a volatile chloride portraying eka hafnium properties though a half life was not accurately determined later calculations indicated that the product was most likely rutherfordium rf in standard notation pu ne x rf x rfcl in researchers at university of california berkeley conclusively synthesized the element by bombarding a californium target with carbon ions and measured the alpha decay of rf correlated with the daughter decay of nobelium cf c rf nthe american synthesis was independently confirmed in and secured the identification of rutherfordium as the parent by the observation of k alpha x rays in the elemental signature of the rf decay product nobelium naming controversy as a consequence of the initial competing claims of discovery an element naming controversy arose since the soviets claimed to have first detected the new element they suggested the name kurchatovium ku in honor of igor kurchatov former head of soviet nuclear research this name had been used in books of the soviet bloc as the official name of the element the americans however proposed rutherfordium rf for the new element to honor ernest rutherford who is known as the father of nuclear physics in the iupac iupap transfermium working group twg assessed the claims of discovery and concluded that both teams provided contemporaneous evidence to the synthesis of element and that credit should be shared between the two groups the american group wrote a scathing response to the findings of the twg stating that they had given too much emphasis on the results from the dubna group in particular they pointed out that the russian group had altered the details of their claims several times over a period of years a fact that the russian team does not deny they also stressed that the twg had given too much credence to the chemistry experiments performed by the russians and accused the twg of not having appropriately qualified personnel on the committee the twg responded by saying that this was not the case and having assessed each point raised by the american group said that they found no reason to alter their conclusion regarding priority of discovery the iupac finally used the name suggested by the american team rutherfordium the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac adopted unnilquadium unq as a temporary systematic element name derived from the latin names for digits and in iupac suggested a set of names for elements through in which dubnium db became element and rutherfordium became element this recommendation was criticized by the american scientists for several reasons firstly their suggestions were scrambled the names rutherfordium and hahnium originally suggested by berkeley for elements and were respectively reassigned to elements and secondly elements and were given names favored by jinr despite earlier recognition of lbl as an equal co discoverer for both of them thirdly and most importantly iupac rejected the name seaborgium for element having just approved a rule that an element could not be named after a living person even though the iupac had given the lbnl team the sole credit for its discovery in iupac renamed elements to and gave element the current name rutherfordium the name dubnium was given to element at the same time isotopes rutherfordium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements sixteen different isotopes have been reported with atomic masses from to with the exceptions of and most of these decay predominantly through spontaneous fission pathways stability and half lives out of isotopes whose half lives are known the lighter isotopes usually have shorter half lives half lives of under s for rf and rf were observed rf rf rf are more stable at around ms rf rf rf and rf live between and seconds and rf rf and rf are more stable at around and minutes respectively the heaviest isotopes are the most stable with rf having a measured half life of about hours the lightest isotopes were synthesized by direct fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products the heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is rf heavier isotopes have only been observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers the heavy isotopes rf and rf have also been reported as electron capture daughters of the dubnium isotopes db and db but have short half lives to spontaneous fission it seems likely that the same is true of rf a likely daughter of db these three isotopes remain unconfirmed in american scientists at the university of california berkeley announced that they had succeeded in synthesizing three atoms of og these parent nuclei were reported to have successively emitted seven alpha particles to form rf nuclei but their claim was retracted in this isotope was later discovered in as the final product in the decay chain of fl predicted properties very few properties of rutherfordium or its compounds have been measured this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that rutherfordium and its parents decays very quickly a few singular chemistry related properties have been measured but properties of rutherfordium metal remain unknown and only predictions are available chemical rutherfordium is the first transactinide element and the second member of the d series of transition metals calculations on its ionization potentials atomic radius as well as radii orbital energies and ground levels of its ionized states are similar to that of hafnium and very different from that of lead therefore it was concluded that rutherfordium s basic properties will resemble those of other group elements below titanium zirconium and hafnium some of its properties were determined by gas phase experiments and aqueous chemistry the oxidation state is the only stable state for the latter two elements and therefore rutherfordium should also exhibit a stable state in addition rutherfordium is also expected to be able to form a less stable state the standard reduction potential of the rf rf couple is predicted to be higher than v initial predictions of the chemical properties of rutherfordium were based on calculations which indicated that the relativistic effects on the electron shell might be strong enough that the p orbitals would have a lower energy level than the d orbitals giving it a valence electron configuration of d s p or even s p therefore making the element behave more like lead than hafnium with better calculation methods and experimental studies of the chemical properties of rutherfordium compounds it could be shown that this does not happen and that rutherfordium instead behaves like the rest of the group elements later it was shown in ab initio calculations with the high level of accuracy that the rf atom has the ground state with the d s valence configuration and the low lying excited d s p state with the excitation energy of only ev in an analogous manner to zirconium and hafnium rutherfordium is projected to form a very stable refractory oxide rfo it reacts with halogens to form tetrahalides rfx which hydrolyze on contact with water to form oxyhalides rfox the tetrahalides are volatile solids existing as monomeric tetrahedral molecules in the vapor phase in the aqueous phase the rf ion hydrolyzes less than titanium iv and to a similar extent as zirconium and hafnium thus resulting in the rfo ion treatment of the halides with halide ions promotes the formation of complex ions the use of chloride and bromide ions produces the hexahalide complexes rfcl and rfbr for the fluoride complexes zirconium and hafnium tend to form hepta and octa complexes thus for the larger rutherfordium ion the complexes rff rff and rff are possible physical and atomic rutherfordium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and have a hexagonal close packed crystal structure c a similar to its lighter congener hafnium it should be a metal with density g cm the atomic radius of rutherfordium is expected to be pm due to relativistic stabilization of the s orbital and destabilization of the d orbital rf and rf ions are predicted to give up d electrons instead of s electrons which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologs when under high pressure variously calculated as or gpa rutherfordium is expected to transition to body centered cubic crystal structure hafnium transforms to this structure at gpa but has an intermediate structure that it transforms to at gpa that should be lacking for rutherfordium experimental chemistry gas phase early work on the study of the chemistry of rutherfordium focused on gas thermochromatography and measurement of relative deposition temperature adsorption curves the initial work was carried out at dubna in an attempt to reaffirm their discovery of the element recent work is more reliable regarding the identification of the parent rutherfordium radioisotopes the isotope mrf has been used for these studies though the long lived isotope rf produced in the decay chain of lv fl and cn may be advantageous for future experiments the experiments relied on the expectation that rutherfordium would begin the new d series of elements and should therefore form a volatile tetrachloride due to the tetrahedral nature of the molecule rutherfordium iv chloride is more volatile than its lighter homologue hafnium iv chloride hfcl because its bonds are more covalent a series of experiments confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as a typical member of group forming a tetravalent chloride rfcl and bromide rfbr as well as an oxychloride rfocl a decreased volatility was observed for rfcl when potassium chloride is provided as the solid phase instead of gas highly indicative of the formation of nonvolatile k rfcl mixed salt aqueous phase rutherfordium is expected to have the electron configuration rn f d s and therefore behave as the heavier homologue of hafnium in group of the periodic table it should therefore readily form a hydrated rf ion in strong acid solution and should readily form complexes in hydrochloric acid hydrobromic or hydrofluoric acid solutions the most conclusive aqueous chemistry studies of rutherfordium have been performed by the japanese team at japan atomic energy research institute using the isotope mrf extraction experiments from hydrochloric acid solutions using isotopes of rutherfordium hafnium zirconium as well as the pseudo group element thorium have proved a non actinide behavior for rutherfordium a comparison with its lighter homologues placed rutherfordium firmly in group and indicated the formation of a hexachlororutherfordate complex in chloride solutions in a manner similar to hafnium and zirconium mrf cl mrfcl very similar results were observed in hydrofluoric acid solutions differences in the extraction curves were interpreted as a weaker affinity for fluoride ion and the formation of the hexafluororutherfordate ion whereas hafnium and zirconium ions complex seven or eight fluoride ions at the concentrations used mrf f mrff experiments performed in mixed sulfuric and nitric acid solutions shows that rutherfordium has a much weaker affinity towards forming sulfate complexes than hafnium this result is in agreement with predictions which expect rutherfordium complexes to be less stable than those of zirconium and hafnium because of a smaller ionic contribution to the bonding this arises because rutherfordium has a larger ionic radius pm than zirconium pm and hafnium pm and also because of relativistic stabilisation of the s orbital and destabilisation and spin orbit splitting of the d orbitals coprecipitation experiments performed in studied rutherfordium s behaviour in basic solution containing ammonia or sodium hydroxide using zirconium hafnium and thorium as comparisons it was found that rutherfordium does not strongly coordinate with ammonia and instead coprecipitates out as a hydroxide which is probably rf oh ,104
Dubnium,Db,dubnium is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol db and atomic number it is highly radioactive the most stable known isotope dubnium has a half life of about hours this greatly limits extended research on the element dubnium does not occur naturally on earth and is produced artificially the soviet joint institute for nuclear research jinr claimed the first discovery of the element in followed by the american lawrence berkeley laboratory in both teams proposed their names for the new element and used them without formal approval the long standing dispute was resolved in by an official investigation of the discovery claims by the transfermium working group formed by the international union of pure and applied chemistry and the international union of pure and applied physics resulting in credit for the discovery being officially shared between both teams the element was formally named dubnium in after the town of dubna the site of the jinr theoretical research establishes dubnium as a member of group in the d series of transition metals placing it under vanadium niobium and tantalum dubnium should share most properties such as its valence electron configuration and having a dominant oxidation state with the other group elements with a few anomalies due to relativistic effects a limited investigation of dubnium chemistry has confirmed this introduction the heaviest atomic nuclei are created in nuclear reactions that combine two other nuclei of unequal size into one roughly the more unequal the two nuclei in terms of mass the greater the possibility that the two react the material made of the heavier nuclei is made into a target which is then bombarded by the beam of lighter nuclei two nuclei can only fuse into one if they approach each other closely enough normally nuclei all positively charged repel each other due to electrostatic repulsion the strong interaction can overcome this repulsion but only within a very short distance from a nucleus beam nuclei are thus greatly accelerated in order to make such repulsion insignificant compared to the velocity of the beam nucleus coming close alone is not enough for two nuclei to fuse when two nuclei approach each other they usually remain together for approximately seconds and then part ways not necessarily in the same composition as before the reaction rather than form a single nucleus if fusion does occur the temporary merger termed a compound nucleus is an excited state to lose its excitation energy and reach a more stable state a compound nucleus either fissions or ejects one or several neutrons which carry away the energy this occurs in approximately seconds after the initial collision the beam passes through the target and reaches the next chamber the separator if a new nucleus is produced it is carried with this beam in the separator the newly produced nucleus is separated from other nuclides that of the original beam and any other reaction products and transferred to a surface barrier detector which stops the nucleus the exact location of the upcoming impact on the detector is marked also marked are its energy and the time of the arrival the transfer takes about seconds in order to be detected the nucleus must survive this long the nucleus is recorded again once its decay is registered and the location the energy and the time of the decay are measured stability of a nucleus is provided by the strong interaction however its range is very short as nuclei become larger their influence on the outermost nucleons protons and neutrons weakens at the same time the nucleus is torn apart by electrostatic repulsion between protons as it has unlimited range nuclei of the heaviest elements are thus theoretically predicted and have so far been observed to primarily decay via decay modes that are caused by such repulsion alpha decay and spontaneous fission these modes are predominant for nuclei of superheavy elements alpha decays are registered by the emitted alpha particles and the decay products are easy to determine before the actual decay if such a decay or a series of consecutive decays produces a known nucleus the original product of a reaction can be determined arithmetically spontaneous fission however produces various nuclei as products so the original nuclide cannot be determined from its daughters the information available to physicists aiming to synthesize one of the heaviest elements is thus the information collected at the detectors location energy and time of arrival of a particle to the detector and those of its decay the physicists analyze this data and seek to conclude that it was indeed caused by a new element and could not have been caused by a different nuclide than the one claimed often provided data is insufficient for a conclusion that a new element was definitely created and there is no other explanation for the observed effects errors in interpreting data have been made discovery background uranium element is the heaviest element to occur in significant quantities in nature heavier elements can only be practically produced by synthesis the first synthesis of a new element neptunium element was achieved in by a team of researchers in the united states in the following years american scientists synthesized the elements up to mendelevium element which was synthesized in from element the priority of discoveries was contested between american and soviet physicists their rivalry resulted in a race for new elements and credit for their discoveries later named the transfermium wars reports the first report of the discovery of element came from the joint institute for nuclear research jinr in dubna moscow oblast soviet union in april the scientists bombarded am with a beam of ne ions and reported mev with a half life of seconds and mev t s alpha activities followed by alpha activities similar to those of either or based on prior theoretical predictions the two activity lines were assigned to and respectively am ne x x n x after observing the alpha decays of element the researchers aimed to observe spontaneous fission sf of the element and study the resulting fission fragments they published a paper in february reporting multiple examples of two such activities with half lives of ms and s they assigned the former activity to mfam and ascribed the latter activity to an isotope of element they suggested that it was unlikely that this activity could come from a transfer reaction instead of element because the yield ratio for this reaction was significantly lower than that of the mfam producing transfer reaction in accordance with theoretical predictions to establish that this activity was not from a ne xn reaction the researchers bombarded a am target with o ions reactions producing and showed very little sf activity matching the established data and the reaction producing heavier and produced no sf activity at all in line with theoretical data the researchers concluded that the activities observed came from sf of element in april a team at lawrence berkeley laboratory lbl in berkeley california united states claimed to have synthesized element by bombarding californium with nitrogen ions with an alpha activity of mev to ensure this activity was not from a different reaction the team attempted other reactions bombarding cf with n pb with n and hg with n they stated no such activity was found in those reactions the characteristics of the daughter nuclei matched those of implying that the parent nuclei were of cf n nthese results did not confirm the jinr findings regarding the mev or mev alpha decay of leaving only as a possibly produced isotope jinr then attempted another experiment to create element published in a report in may they claimed that they had synthesized more nuclei of element and that the experiment confirmed their previous work according to the paper the isotope produced by jinr was probably or possibly this report included an initial chemical examination the thermal gradient version of the gas chromatography method was applied to demonstrate that the chloride of what had formed from the sf activity nearly matched that of niobium pentachloride rather than hafnium tetrachloride the team identified a second sf activity in a volatile chloride portraying eka tantalum properties and inferred that the source of the sf activity must have been element in june jinr made improvements on their first experiment using a purer target and reducing the intensity of transfer reactions by installing a collimator before the catcher this time they were able to find mev alpha activities with daughter isotopes identifiable as either or implying that the original isotope was either or naming controversy jinr did not propose a name after their first report claiming synthesis of element which would have been the usual practice this led lbl to believe that jinr did not have enough experimental data to back their claim after collecting more data jinr proposed the name bohrium bo in honor of the danish nuclear physicist niels bohr a founder of the theories of atomic structure and quantum theory they soon changed their proposal to nielsbohrium ns to avoid confusion with boron another proposed name was dubnium when lbl first announced their synthesis of element they proposed that the new element be named hahnium ha after the german chemist otto hahn the father of nuclear chemistry thus creating an element naming controversy in the early s both teams reported synthesis of the next element element but did not suggest names jinr suggested establishing an international committee to clarify the discovery criteria this proposal was accepted in and a neutral joint group formed neither team showed interest in resolving the conflict through a third party so the leading scientists of lbl albert ghiorso and glenn seaborg traveled to dubna in and met with the leading scientists of jinr georgy flerov yuri oganessian and others to try to resolve the conflict internally and render the neutral joint group unnecessary after two hours of discussions this failed the joint neutral group never assembled to assess the claims and the conflict remained unresolved in iupac suggested systematic element names to be used as placeholders until permanent names were established under it element would be unnilpentium from the latin roots un and nil and the greek root pent meaning one zero and five respectively the digits of the atomic number both teams ignored it as they did not wish to weaken their outstanding claims in the gesellschaft f r schwerionenforschung gsi society for heavy ion research in darmstadt hesse west germany claimed synthesis of element their report came out five years after the first report from jinr but with greater precision making a more solid claim on discovery gsi acknowledged jinr s efforts by suggesting the name nielsbohrium for the new element jinr did not suggest a new name for element stating it was more important to determine its discoverers first in the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac and the international union of pure and applied physics iupap formed a transfermium working group twg to assess discoveries and establish final names for the controversial elements the party held meetings with delegates from the three competing institutes in they established criteria on recognition of an element and in they finished the work on assessing discoveries and disbanded these results were published in according to the report the first definitely successful experiment was the april lbl experiment closely followed by the june jinr experiment so credit for the discovery of the element should be shared between the two teams lbl said that the input from jinr was overrated in the review they claimed jinr was only able to unambiguously demonstrate the synthesis of element a year after they did jinr and gsi endorsed the report in iupac published a recommendation on naming the disputed elements for element they proposed joliotium jl after the french physicist fr d ric joliot curie a contributor to the development of nuclear physics and chemistry this name was originally proposed by the soviet team for element which by then had long been called nobelium this recommendation was criticized by the american scientists for several reasons firstly their suggestions were scrambled the names rutherfordium and hahnium originally suggested by berkeley for elements and were respectively reassigned to elements and secondly elements and were given names favored by jinr despite earlier recognition of lbl as an equal co discoverer for both of them thirdly and most importantly iupac rejected the name seaborgium for element having just approved a rule that an element could not be named after a living person even though the report had given the lbl team the sole credit for its discovery in iupac abandoned the controversial rule and established a committee of national representatives aimed at finding a compromise they suggested seaborgium for element in exchange for the removal of all the other american proposals except for the established name lawrencium for element the equally entrenched name nobelium for element was replaced by flerovium after georgy flerov following the recognition by the report that that element had been first synthesized in dubna this was rejected by american scientists and the decision was retracted the name flerovium was later used for element in iupac held another meeting reconsidered all names in hand and accepted another set of recommendations it was approved and published in element was named dubnium db after dubna in russia the location of the jinr the american suggestions were used for elements and the name dubnium had been used for element in the previous iupac recommendation the american scientists reluctantly approved this decision iupac pointed out that the berkeley laboratory had already been recognized several times in the naming of berkelium californium and americium and that the acceptance of the names rutherfordium and seaborgium for elements and should be offset by recognizing jinr s contributions to the discovery of elements and even after lbl still sometimes used the name hahnium for element in their own material doing so as recently as however the problem was resolved in the literature as jens volker kratz editor of radiochimica acta refused to accept papers not using the iupac nomenclature isotopes dubnium having an atomic number of is a superheavy element like all elements with such high atomic numbers it is very unstable the longest lasting known isotope of dubnium db has a half life of around a day no stable isotopes have been seen and a calculation by jinr suggested that the half lives of all dubnium isotopes would not significantly exceed a day dubnium can only be obtained by artificial production the short half life of dubnium limits experimentation this is exacerbated by the fact that the most stable isotopes are the hardest to synthesize elements with a lower atomic number have stable isotopes with a lower neutron proton ratio than those with higher atomic number meaning that the target and beam nuclei that could be employed to create the superheavy element have fewer neutrons than needed to form these most stable isotopes different techniques based on rapid neutron capture and transfer reactions are being considered as of the s but those based on the collision of a large and small nucleus still dominate research in the area only a few atoms of db can be produced in each experiment and thus the measured lifetimes vary significantly during the process during three experiments atoms were created in total with a resulting half life of hours the second most stable isotope db has been produced in even smaller quantities three atoms in total with lifetimes of h h and h these two are the heaviest isotopes of dubnium to date and both were produced as a result of decay of the heavier nuclei mc and ts rather than directly because the experiments that yielded them were originally designed in dubna for ca beams for its mass ca has by far the greatest neutron excess of all practically stable nuclei both quantitative and relative which correspondingly helps synthesize superheavy nuclei with more neutrons but this gain is compensated by the decreased likelihood of fusion for high atomic numbers predicted properties according to the periodic law dubnium should belong to group with vanadium niobium and tantalum several studies have investigated the properties of element and found that they generally agreed with the predictions of the periodic law significant deviations may nevertheless occur due to relativistic effects which dramatically change physical properties on both atomic and macroscopic scales these properties have remained challenging to measure for several reasons the difficulties of production of superheavy atoms the low rates of production which only allows for microscopic scales requirements for a radiochemistry laboratory to test the atoms short half lives of those atoms and the presence of many unwanted activities apart from those of synthesis of superheavy atoms so far studies have only been performed on single atoms atomic and physical a direct relativistic effect is that as the atomic numbers of elements increase the innermost electrons begin to revolve faster around the nucleus as a result of an increase of electromagnetic attraction between an electron and a nucleus similar effects have been found for the outermost s orbitals and p ones though in dubnium they are not occupied for example the s orbital contracts by in size and is stabilized by ev a more indirect effect is that the contracted s and p orbitals shield the charge of the nucleus more effectively leaving less for the outer d and f electrons which therefore move in larger orbitals dubnium is greatly affected by this unlike the previous group members its s electrons are slightly more difficult to extract than its d electrons another effect is the spin orbit interaction particularly spin orbit splitting which splits the d subshell the azimuthal quantum number of a d shell is into two subshells with four of the ten orbitals having their lowered to and six raised to all ten energy levels are raised four of them are lower than the other six the three d electrons normally occupy the lowest energy levels d a singly ionized atom of dubnium db should lose a d electron compared to a neutral atom the doubly db or triply db ionized atoms of dubnium should eliminate s electrons unlike its lighter homologs despite the changes dubnium is still expected to have five valence electrons p energy levels have not been shown to influence dubnium and its properties as the d orbitals of dubnium are more destabilized than the d ones of tantalum and db is expected to have two d rather than s electrons remaining the resulting oxidation state is expected to be unstable and even rarer than that of tantalum the ionization potential of dubnium in its maximum oxidation state should be slightly lower than that of tantalum and the ionic radius of dubnium should increase compared to tantalum this has a significant effect on dubnium s chemistry atoms of dubnium in the solid state should arrange themselves in a body centered cubic configuration like the previous group elements the predicted density of dubnium is g cm chemical computational chemistry is simplest in gas phase chemistry in which interactions between molecules may be ignored as negligible multiple authors have researched dubnium pentachloride calculations show it to be consistent with the periodic laws by exhibiting the properties of a compound of a group element for example the molecular orbital levels indicate that dubnium uses three d electron levels as expected compared to its tantalum analog dubnium pentachloride is expected to show increased covalent character a decrease in the effective charge on an atom and an increase in the overlap population between orbitals of dubnium and chlorine calculations of solution chemistry indicate that the maximum oxidation state of dubnium will be more stable than those of niobium and tantalum and the and states will be less stable the tendency towards hydrolysis of cations with the highest oxidation state should continue to decrease within group but is still expected to be quite rapid complexation of dubnium is expected to follow group trends in its richness calculations for hydroxo chlorido complexes have shown a reversal in the trends of complex formation and extraction of group elements with dubnium being more prone to do so than tantalum experimental chemistry experimental results of the chemistry of dubnium date back to and jinr researchers used a thermochromatographic system and concluded that the volatility of dubnium bromide was less than that of niobium bromide and about the same as that of hafnium bromide it is not certain that the detected fission products confirmed that the parent was indeed element these results may imply that dubnium behaves more like hafnium than niobium the next studies on the chemistry of dubnium were conducted in in berkeley they examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid sorption of dubnium on glass cover slips was then compared with that of the group elements niobium and tantalum and the group elements zirconium and hafnium produced under similar conditions the group elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces the group elements do not dubnium was confirmed as a group member surprisingly the behavior on extraction from mixed nitric and hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl isobutyl ketone differed between dubnium tantalum and niobium dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum indicating that complexing behavior could not be predicted purely from simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table this prompted further exploration of the chemical behavior of complexes of dubnium various labs jointly conducted thousands of repetitive chromatographic experiments between and all group elements and protactinium were extracted from concentrated hydrochloric acid after mixing with lower concentrations of hydrogen chloride small amounts of hydrogen fluoride were added to start selective re extraction dubnium showed behavior different from that of tantalum but similar to that of niobium and its pseudohomolog protactinium at concentrations of hydrogen chloride below moles per liter this similarity to the two elements suggested that the formed complex was either dbox or db oh x after extraction experiments of dubnium from hydrogen bromide into diisobutyl carbinol dimethylheptan ol a specific extractant for protactinium with subsequent elutions with the hydrogen chloride hydrogen fluoride mix as well as hydrogen chloride dubnium was found to be less prone to extraction than either protactinium or niobium this was explained as an increasing tendency to form non extractable complexes of multiple negative charges further experiments in confirmed the stability of the state db v was shown to be extractable from cation exchange columns with hydroxyisobutyrate like the group elements and protactinium db iii and db iv were not in and new predictions suggested that dubnium would extract nearly as well as niobium and better than tantalum from halide solutions which was later confirmed the first isothermal gas chromatography experiments were performed in with db half life seconds the volatilities for niobium and tantalum were similar within error limits but dubnium appeared to be significantly less volatile it was postulated that traces of oxygen in the system might have led to formation of dbobr which was predicted to be less volatile than dbbr later experiments in showed that group chlorides were more volatile than the corresponding bromides with the exception of tantalum presumably due to formation of taocl later volatility studies of chlorides of dubnium and niobium as a function of controlled partial pressures of oxygen showed that formation of oxychlorides and general volatility are dependent on concentrations of oxygen the oxychlorides were shown to be less volatile than the chlorides in researchers from dubna and livermore identified a new dubnium isotope db as a fivefold alpha decay product of the newly created element this new isotope proved to be long lived enough to allow further chemical experimentation with a half life of over a day in the experiment a thin layer with dubnium was removed from the surface of the target and dissolved in aqua regia with tracers and a lanthanum carrier from which various and species were precipitated on adding ammonium hydroxide the precipitate was washed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid where it converted to nitrate form and was then dried on a film and counted mostly containing a species which was immediately assigned to dubnium it also had a species based on that result the team decided that additional chemical separation was needed in the experiment was repeated with the final product being hydroxide rather than nitrate precipitate which was processed further in both livermore based on reverse phase chromatography and dubna based on anion exchange chromatography the species was effectively isolated dubnium appeared three times in tantalum only fractions and never in niobium only fractions it was noted that these experiments were insufficient to draw conclusions about the general chemical profile of dubnium in at the jaea tandem accelerator in japan dubnium was processed in nitric and hydrofluoric acid solution at concentrations where niobium forms nbof and tantalum forms taf dubnium s behavior was close to that of niobium but not tantalum it was thus deduced that dubnium formed dbof from the available information it was concluded that dubnium often behaved like niobium sometimes like protactinium but rarely like tantalum in the volatile heavy group oxychlorides mocl m nb ta db were experimentally studied at the jaea tandem accelerator the trend in volatilities was found to be nbocl taocl dbocl so that dubnium behaves in line with periodic trends ,105
Seaborgium,Sg,seaborgium is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol sg and atomic number it is named after the american nuclear chemist glenn t seaborg as a synthetic element it can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature it is also radioactive the most stable known isotope sg has a half life of approximately minutes in the periodic table of the elements it is a d block transactinide element it is a member of the th period and belongs to the group elements as the fourth member of the d series of transition metals chemistry experiments have confirmed that seaborgium behaves as the heavier homologue to tungsten in group the chemical properties of seaborgium are characterized only partly but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group elements in a few atoms of seaborgium were produced in laboratories in the soviet union and in the united states the priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between soviet and american scientists and it was not until that the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac established seaborgium as the official name for the element it is one of only two elements named after a living person at the time of naming the other being oganesson element introduction the heaviest atomic nuclei are created in nuclear reactions that combine two other nuclei of unequal size into one roughly the more unequal the two nuclei in terms of mass the greater the possibility that the two react the material made of the heavier nuclei is made into a target which is then bombarded by the beam of lighter nuclei two nuclei can only fuse into one if they approach each other closely enough normally nuclei all positively charged repel each other due to electrostatic repulsion the strong interaction can overcome this repulsion but only within a very short distance from a nucleus beam nuclei are thus greatly accelerated in order to make such repulsion insignificant compared to the velocity of the beam nucleus coming close alone is not enough for two nuclei to fuse when two nuclei approach each other they usually remain together for approximately seconds and then part ways not necessarily in the same composition as before the reaction rather than form a single nucleus if fusion does occur the temporary merger termed a compound nucleus is an excited state to lose its excitation energy and reach a more stable state a compound nucleus either fissions or ejects one or several neutrons which carry away the energy this occurs in approximately seconds after the initial collision the beam passes through the target and reaches the next chamber the separator if a new nucleus is produced it is carried with this beam in the separator the newly produced nucleus is separated from other nuclides that of the original beam and any other reaction products and transferred to a surface barrier detector which stops the nucleus the exact location of the upcoming impact on the detector is marked also marked are its energy and the time of the arrival the transfer takes about seconds in order to be detected the nucleus must survive this long the nucleus is recorded again once its decay is registered and the location the energy and the time of the decay are measured stability of a nucleus is provided by the strong interaction however its range is very short as nuclei become larger their influence on the outermost nucleons protons and neutrons weakens at the same time the nucleus is torn apart by electrostatic repulsion between protons as it has unlimited range nuclei of the heaviest elements are thus theoretically predicted and have so far been observed to primarily decay via decay modes that are caused by such repulsion alpha decay and spontaneous fission these modes are predominant for nuclei of superheavy elements alpha decays are registered by the emitted alpha particles and the decay products are easy to determine before the actual decay if such a decay or a series of consecutive decays produces a known nucleus the original product of a reaction can be determined arithmetically spontaneous fission however produces various nuclei as products so the original nuclide cannot be determined from its daughters the information available to physicists aiming to synthesize one of the heaviest elements is thus the information collected at the detectors location energy and time of arrival of a particle to the detector and those of its decay the physicists analyze this data and seek to conclude that it was indeed caused by a new element and could not have been caused by a different nuclide than the one claimed often provided data is insufficient for a conclusion that a new element was definitely created and there is no other explanation for the observed effects errors in interpreting data have been made history following claims of the observation of elements and in by albert ghiorso et al at the lawrence livermore national laboratory a search for element using oxygen projectiles and the previously used californium target was conducted several mev alpha decays were reported and are now thought to originate from element though this was not confirmed at the time in the hilac accelerator received equipment upgrades preventing the team from repeating the experiment and data analysis was not done during the shutdown this reaction was tried again several years later in and the berkeley team realized that their new data agreed with their data to the astonishment of ghiorso hence element could have actually been discovered in if the original data was analyzed more carefully two groups claimed discovery of the element unambiguous evidence of element was first reported in by a russian research team in dubna led by yuri oganessian in which targets of lead and lead were bombarded with accelerated ions of chromium in total fifty one spontaneous fission events were observed with a half life between four and ten milliseconds after having ruled out nucleon transfer reactions as a cause for these activities the team concluded that the most likely cause of the activities was the spontaneous fission of isotopes of element the isotope in question was first suggested to be seaborgium but was later corrected to seaborgium pb cr sg n pb cr sg na few months later in researchers including glenn t seaborg carol alonso and albert ghiorso at the university of california berkeley and e kenneth hulet from the lawrence livermore national laboratory also synthesized the element by bombarding a californium target with oxygen ions using equipment similar to that which had been used for the synthesis of element five years earlier observing at least seventy alpha decays seemingly from the isotope seaborgium m with a half life of seconds the alpha daughter rutherfordium and granddaughter nobelium had previously been synthesised and the properties observed here matched with those previously known as did the intensity of their production the cross section of the reaction observed nanobarns also agreed well with theoretical predictions these bolstered the assignment of the alpha decay events to seaborgium m cf o m sg n rf no a dispute thus arose from the initial competing claims of discovery though unlike the case of the synthetic elements up to element neither team of discoverers chose to announce proposed names for the new elements thus averting an element naming controversy temporarily the dispute on discovery however dragged on until when the iupac iupap transfermium working group twg formed to put an end to the controversy by making conclusions regarding discovery claims for elements to concluded that the soviet synthesis of seaborgium was not convincing enough lacking as it is in yield curves and angular selection results whereas the american synthesis of seaborgium was convincing due to its being firmly anchored to known daughter nuclei as such the twg recognised the berkeley team as official discoverers in their report seaborg had previously suggested to the twg that if berkeley was recognised as the official discoverer of elements and they might propose the name kurchatovium symbol kt for element to honour the dubna team which had proposed this name for element after igor kurchatov the former head of the soviet nuclear research programme however due to the worsening relations between the competing teams after the publication of the twg report because the berkeley team vehemently disagreed with the twg s conclusions especially regarding element this proposal was dropped from consideration by the berkeley team after being recognized as official discoverers the berkeley team started deciding on a name in earnest we were given credit for the discovery and the accompanying right to name the new element the eight members of the ghiorso group suggested a wide range of names honoring isaac newton thomas edison leonardo da vinci ferdinand magellan the mythical ulysses george washington and finland the native land of a member of the team there was no focus and no front runner for a long period then one day al ghiorso walked into my office and asked what i thought of naming element seaborgium i was floored seaborg s son eric remembered the naming process as follows with eight scientists involved in the discovery suggesting so many good possibilities ghiorso despaired of reaching consensus until he awoke one night with an idea he approached the team members one by one until seven of them had agreed he then told his friend and colleague of years we have seven votes in favor of naming element seaborgium will you give your consent my father was flabbergasted and after consulting my mother agreed the name seaborgium and symbol sg were announced at the th national meeting of the american chemical society in march by kenneth hulet one of the co discovers however iupac resolved in august that an element could not be named after a living person and seaborg was still alive at the time thus in september iupac recommended a set of names in which the names proposed by the three laboratories the third being the gsi helmholtz centre for heavy ion research in darmstadt germany with competing claims to the discovery for elements to were shifted to various other elements in which rutherfordium rf the berkeley proposal for element was shifted to element with seaborgium being dropped entirely as a name this decision ignited a firestorm of worldwide protest for disregarding the historic discoverer s right to name new elements and against the new retroactive rule against naming elements after living persons the american chemical society stood firmly behind the name seaborgium for element together with all the other american and german naming proposals for elements to approving these names for its journals in defiance of iupac at first iupac defended itself with an american member of its committee writing discoverers don t have a right to name an element they have a right to suggest a name and of course we didn t infringe on that at all however seaborg responded this would be the first time in history that the acknowledged and uncontested discoverers of an element are denied the privilege of naming it bowing to public pressure iupac proposed a different compromise in august in which the name seaborgium was reinstated for element in exchange for the removal of all but one of the other american proposals which met an even worse response finally iupac rescinded these previous compromises and made a final new recommendation in august in which the american and german proposals for elements to were all adopted including seaborgium for element with the single exception of element named dubnium to recognise the contributions of the dubna team to the experimental procedures of transactinide synthesis this list was finally accepted by the american chemical society which wrote in the interest of international harmony the committee reluctantly accepted the name dubnium for element in place of hahnium the american proposal which has had long standing use in literature we are pleased to note that seaborgium is now the internationally approved name for element seaborg commented regarding the naming i am needless to say proud that u s chemists recommended that element which is placed under tungsten be called seaborgium i was looking forward to the day when chemical investigators will refer to such compounds as seaborgous chloride seaborgic nitrate and perhaps sodium seaborgate this is the greatest honor ever bestowed upon me even better i think than winning the nobel prize future students of chemistry in learning about the periodic table may have reason to ask why the element was named for me and thereby learn more about my work seaborg died a year and a half later on february at the age of isotopes superheavy elements such as seaborgium are produced by bombarding lighter elements in particle accelerators that induces fusion reactions whereas most of the isotopes of seaborgium can be synthesized directly this way some heavier ones have only been observed as decay products of elements with higher atomic numbers depending on the energies involved fusion reactions that generate superheavy elements are separated into hot and cold in hot fusion reactions very light high energy projectiles are accelerated toward very heavy targets actinides giving rise to compound nuclei at high excitation energy mev that may either fission or evaporate several to neutrons in cold fusion reactions the produced fused nuclei have a relatively low excitation energy mev which decreases the probability that these products will undergo fission reactions as the fused nuclei cool to the ground state they require emission of only one or two neutrons and thus allows for the generation of more neutron rich products the latter is a distinct concept from that of where nuclear fusion claimed to be achieved at room temperature conditions see cold fusion seaborgium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements twelve different isotopes of seaborgium have been reported with atomic masses and three of which seaborgium and have known metastable states all of these decay only through alpha decay and spontaneous fission with the single exception of seaborgium that can also undergo electron capture to dubnium there is a trend toward increasing half lives for the heavier isotopes thus the heaviest three known isotopes sg sg and sg are also the longest lived having half lives in minutes some other isotopes in this region are predicted to have comparable or even longer half lives additionally sg sg and msg have half lives measured in seconds all the remaining isotopes have half lives measured in milliseconds with the exception of the shortest lived isotope msg with a half life of only microseconds the proton rich isotopes from sg to sg were directly produced by cold fusion all heavier isotopes were produced from the repeated alpha decay of the heavier elements hassium darmstadtium and flerovium with the exceptions of the isotopes msg sg sg and msg which were directly produced by hot fusion through irradiation of actinide targets the twelve isotopes of seaborgium have half lives ranging from microseconds for msg to minutes for sg predicted properties very few properties of seaborgium or its compounds have been measured this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that seaborgium and its parents decays very quickly a few singular chemistry related properties have been measured but properties of seaborgium metal remain unknown and only predictions are available physical seaborgium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a body centered cubic crystal structure similar to its lighter congener tungsten early predictions estimated that it should be a very heavy metal with density around g cm but calculations in and predicted a somewhat lower value of g cm chemical seaborgium is the fourth member of the d series of transition metals and the heaviest member of group in the periodic table below chromium molybdenum and tungsten all the members of the group form a diversity of oxoanions they readily portray their group oxidation state of although this is highly oxidising in the case of chromium and this state becomes more and more stable to reduction as the group is descended indeed tungsten is the last of the d transition metals where all four d electrons participate in metallic bonding as such seaborgium should have as its most stable oxidation state both in the gas phase and in aqueous solution and this is the only oxidation state that is experimentally known for it the and states should be less stable and the state the most common for chromium would be the least stable for seaborgium this stabilisation of the highest oxidation state occurs in the early d elements because of the similarity between the energies of the d and s orbitals since the s orbitals are relativistically stabilised and the d orbitals are relativistically destabilised this effect is so large in the seventh period that seaborgium is expected to lose its d electrons before its s electrons sg rn f d s sg rn f d s sg rn f d s sg rn f d sg rn f because of the great destabilisation of the s orbital sgiv should be even more unstable than wiv and should be very readily oxidised to sgvi the predicted ionic radius of the hexacoordinate sg ion is pm while the predicted atomic radius of seaborgium is pm nevertheless the stability of the highest oxidation state is still expected to decrease as lriii rfiv dbv sgvi some predicted standard reduction potentials for seaborgium ions in aqueous acidic solution are as follows seaborgium should form a very volatile hexafluoride sgf as well as a moderately volatile hexachloride sgcl pentachloride sgcl and oxychlorides sgo cl and sgocl sgo cl is expected to be the most stable of the seaborgium oxychlorides and to be the least volatile of the group oxychlorides with the sequence moo cl wo cl sgo cl the volatile seaborgium vi compounds sgcl and sgocl are expected to be unstable to decomposition to seaborgium v compounds at high temperatures analogous to mocl and moocl this should not happen for sgo cl due to the much higher energy gap between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals despite the similar sg cl bond strengths similarly to molybdenum and tungsten molybdenum and tungsten are very similar to each other and show important differences to the smaller chromium and seaborgium is expected to follow the chemistry of tungsten and molybdenum quite closely forming an even greater variety of oxoanions the simplest among them being seaborgate sgo which would form from the rapid hydrolysis of sg h o although this would take place less readily than with molybdenum and tungsten as expected from seaborgium s greater size seaborgium should hydrolyse less readily than tungsten in hydrofluoric acid at low concentrations but more readily at high concentrations also forming complexes such as sgo f and sgof complex formation competes with hydrolysis in hydrofluoric acid experimental chemistry experimental chemical investigation of seaborgium has been hampered due to the need to produce it one atom at a time its short half life and the resulting necessary harshness of the experimental conditions the isotope sg and its isomer msg are advantageous for radiochemistry they are produced in the cm ne n reaction in the first experimental chemical studies of seaborgium in and seaborgium atoms were produced in the reaction cm ne n sg thermalised and reacted with an o hcl mixture the adsorption properties of the resulting oxychloride were measured and compared with those of molybdenum and tungsten compounds the results indicated that seaborgium formed a volatile oxychloride akin to those of the other group elements and confirmed the decreasing trend of oxychloride volatility down group sg o hcl sgo cl h in a team continued the study of the gas phase chemistry of seaborgium by reacting the element with o in a h o environment in a manner similar to the formation of the oxychloride the results of the experiment indicated the formation of seaborgium oxide hydroxide a reaction well known among the lighter group homologues as well as the pseudohomologue uranium sg o sgo sgo h o sgo oh predictions on the aqueous chemistry of seaborgium have largely been confirmed in experiments conducted in and seaborgium was eluted from cation exchange resin using a hno hf solution most likely as neutral sgo f or the anionic complex ion sgo f rather than sgo in contrast in m nitric acid seaborgium does not elute unlike molybdenum and tungsten indicating that the hydrolysis of sg h o only proceeds as far as the cationic complex sg oh h o or sg oh h o while that of molybdenum and tungsten proceeds to neutral mo oh the only other oxidation state known for seaborgium other than the group oxidation state of is the zero oxidation state similarly to its three lighter congeners forming chromium hexacarbonyl molybdenum hexacarbonyl and tungsten hexacarbonyl seaborgium has been shown in to also form seaborgium hexacarbonyl sg co like its molybdenum and tungsten homologues seaborgium hexacarbonyl is a volatile compound that reacts readily with silicon dioxide ,106
Bohrium,Bh,bohrium is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol bh and atomic number it is named after danish physicist niels bohr as a synthetic element it can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature all known isotopes of bohrium are highly radioactive the most stable known isotope is bh with a half life of approximately seconds though the unconfirmed bh may have a longer half life of about seconds in the periodic table it is a d block transactinide element it is a member of the th period and belongs to the group elements as the fifth member of the d series of transition metals chemistry experiments have confirmed that bohrium behaves as the heavier homologue to rhenium in group the chemical properties of bohrium are characterized only partly but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group elements introduction the heaviest atomic nuclei are created in nuclear reactions that combine two other nuclei of unequal size into one roughly the more unequal the two nuclei in terms of mass the greater the possibility that the two react the material made of the heavier nuclei is made into a target which is then bombarded by the beam of lighter nuclei two nuclei can only fuse into one if they approach each other closely enough normally nuclei all positively charged repel each other due to electrostatic repulsion the strong interaction can overcome this

in interpreting data have been made history discovery two groups claimed discovery of the element evidence of bohrium was first reported in by a soviet research team led by yuri oganessian in which targets of bismuth and lead were bombarded with accelerated nuclei of chromium and manganese respectively two activities one with a half life of one to two milliseconds and the other with an approximately five second half life were seen since the ratio of the intensities of these two activities was constant throughout the experiment it was proposed that the first was from the isotope bohrium and that the second was from its daughter dubnium later the dubnium isotope was corrected to dubnium which indeed has a five second half life dubnium has a one second half life however the half life observed for its parent is much shorter than the half lives later observed in the definitive discovery of bohrium at darmstadt in the iupac iupap transfermium working group twg concluded that while dubnium was probably seen in this experiment the evidence for the production of its parent bohrium was not convincing enough in a german research team led by peter armbruster and gottfried m nzenberg at the gsi helmholtz centre for heavy ion research gsi helmholtzzentrum f r schwerionenforschung in darmstadt bombarded a target of bismuth with accelerated nuclei of chromium to produce atoms of the isotope bohrium bi cr bh nthis discovery was further substantiated by their detailed measurements of the alpha decay chain of the produced bohrium atoms to previously known isotopes of fermium and californium the iupac iupap transfermium working group twg recognised the gsi collaboration as official discoverers in their report proposed names in september the german group suggested the name nielsbohrium with symbol ns to honor the danish physicist niels bohr the soviet scientists at the joint institute for nuclear research in dubna russia had suggested this name be given to element which was finally called dubnium and the german team wished to recognise both bohr and the fact that the dubna team had been the first to propose the cold fusion reaction and simultaneously help to solve the controversial problem of the naming of element the dubna team agreed with the german group s naming proposal for element there was an element naming controversy as to what the elements from to were to be called the iupac adopted unnilseptium symbol uns as a temporary systematic element name for this element in a committee of iupac recommended that element be named bohrium not nielsbohrium since there was no precedent for using a scientist s complete name in the naming of an element this was opposed by the discoverers as there was some concern that the name might be confused with boron and in particular the distinguishing of the names of their respective oxyanions bohrate and borate the matter was handed to the danish branch of iupac which despite this voted in favour of the name bohrium and thus the name bohrium for element was recognized internationally in the names of the respective oxyanions of boron and bohrium remain unchanged despite their homophony isotopes bohrium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements twelve different isotopes of bohrium have been reported with atomic masses and one of which bohrium has a known metastable state all of these but the unconfirmed bh decay only through alpha decay although some unknown bohrium isotopes are predicted to undergo spontaneous fission the lighter isotopes usually have shorter half lives half lives of under ms for bh bh bh and mbh were observed bh bh bh and bh are more stable at around s and bh and bh have half lives of about s the heaviest isotopes are the most stable with bh and bh having measured half lives of about s and s respectively and the even heavier unconfirmed isotope bh appearing to have an even longer half life of about s the most proton rich isotopes with masses and were directly produced by cold fusion those with mass and were reported in the decay chains of meitnerium and roentgenium while the neutron rich isotopes with masses were created in irradiations of actinide targets the five most neutron rich ones with masses and unconfirmed appear in the decay chains of nh mc mc ts and fl respectively these eleven isotopes have half lives ranging from about ten milliseconds for mbh to about one minute for bh and bh extending to about twelve minutes for the unconfirmed bh one of the longest lived known superheavy nuclides predicted properties very few properties of bohrium or its compounds have been measured this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that bohrium and its parents decays very quickly a few singular chemistry related properties have been measured but properties of bohrium metal remain unknown and only predictions are available chemical bohrium is the fifth member of the d series of transition metals and the heaviest member of group in the periodic table below manganese technetium and rhenium all the members of the group readily portray their group oxidation state of and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended thus bohrium is expected to form a stable state technetium also shows a stable state whilst rhenium exhibits stable and states bohrium may therefore show these lower states as well the higher oxidation state is more likely to exist in oxyanions such as perbohrate bho analogous to the lighter permanganate pertechnetate and perrhenate nevertheless bohrium vii is likely to be unstable in aqueous solution and would probably be easily reduced to the more stable bohrium iv technetium and rhenium are known to form volatile heptoxides m o m tc re so bohrium should also form the volatile oxide bh o the oxide should dissolve in water to form perbohric acid hbho rhenium and technetium form a range of oxyhalides from the halogenation of the oxide the chlorination of the oxide forms the oxychlorides mo cl so bho cl should be formed in this reaction fluorination results in mo f and mo f for the heavier elements in addition to the rhenium compounds reof and ref therefore oxyfluoride formation for bohrium may help to indicate eka rhenium properties since the oxychlorides are asymmetrical and they should have increasingly large dipole moments going down the group they should become less volatile in the order tco cl reo cl bho cl this was experimentally confirmed in by measuring the enthalpies of adsorption of these three compounds the values are for tco cl and reo cl are kj mol and kj mol respectively the experimental value for bho cl is kj mol very close to the theoretically expected value of kj mol physical and atomic bohrium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close packed crystal structure c a similar to its lighter congener rhenium early predictions by fricke estimated its density at g cm but newer calculations predict a somewhat lower value of g cm the atomic radius of bohrium is expected to be around pm due to the relativistic stabilization of the s orbital and destabilization of the d orbital the bh ion is predicted to have an electron configuration of rn f d s giving up a d electron instead of a s electron which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues manganese and technetium rhenium on the other hand follows its heavier congener bohrium in giving up a d electron before a s electron as relativistic effects have become significant by the sixth period where they cause among other things the yellow color of gold and the low melting point of mercury the bh ion is expected to have an electron configuration of rn f d s in contrast the re ion is expected to have a xe f d configuration this time analogous to manganese and technetium the ionic radius of hexacoordinate heptavalent bohrium is expected to be pm heptavalent manganese technetium and rhenium having values of and pm respectively pentavalent bohrium should have a larger ionic radius of pm experimental chemistry in the first report on attempted isolation of the element was unsuccessful prompting new theoretical studies to investigate how best to investigate bohrium using its lighter homologs technetium and rhenium for comparison and removing unwanted contaminating elements such as the trivalent actinides the group elements and polonium in it was confirmed that although relativistic effects are important bohrium behaves like a typical group element a team at the paul scherrer institute psi conducted a chemistry reaction using six atoms of bh produced in the reaction between bk and ne ions the resulting atoms were thermalised and reacted with a hcl o mixture to form a volatile oxychloride the reaction also produced isotopes of its lighter homologues technetium as tc and rhenium as re the isothermal adsorption curves were measured and gave strong evidence for the formation of a volatile oxychloride with properties similar to that of rhenium oxychloride this placed bohrium as a typical member of group the adsorption enthalpies of the oxychlorides of technetium rhenium and bohrium were measured in this experiment agreeing very well with the theoretical predictions and implying a sequence of decreasing oxychloride volatility down group of tco cl reo cl bho cl bh o hcl bho cl h the longer lived heavy isotopes of bohrium produced as the daughters of heavier elements offer advantages for future radiochemical experiments although the heavy isotope bh requires a rare and highly radioactive berkelium target for its production the isotopes bh bh and bh can be readily produced as daughters of more easily produced moscovium and nihonium isotopes ,107
Hassium,Hs,hassium is a chemical element with the symbol hs and the atomic number hassium is highly radioactive its most stable known isotopes have half lives of approximately ten seconds one of its isotopes hs has magic numbers of both protons and neutrons for deformed nuclei which gives it greater stability against spontaneous fission hassium is a superheavy element it has been produced in a laboratory only in very small quantities by fusing heavy nuclei with lighter ones natural occurrences of the element have been hypothesised but never found in the periodic table of elements hassium is a transactinide element a member of the th period and group it is thus the sixth member of the d series of transition metals chemistry experiments have confirmed that hassium behaves as the heavier homologue to osmium reacting readily with oxygen to form a volatile tetroxide the chemical properties of hassium have been only partly characterized but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group elements the principal innovation that led to the discovery of hassium was the technique of cold fusion in which the fused nuclei did not differ by mass as much as in earlier techniques it relied on greater stability of target nuclei which in turn decreased excitation energy this decreased the number of neutron ejections during synthesis creating heavier more stable resulting nuclei the technique was first tested at the joint institute for nuclear research jinr in dubna moscow oblast russian sfsr soviet union in jinr used this technique to attempt synthesis of element in in and in the latter experiment resulted in a claim that element had been produced later in a synthesis claim followed from the gesellschaft f r schwerionenforschung gsi in darmstadt hesse west germany the report by the transfermium working group formed by the international union of pure and applied chemistry and the international union of pure and applied physics concluded that the report from darmstadt was conclusive on its own whereas that from dubna was not and major credit was assigned to the german scientists gsi formally announced they wished to name the element hassium after the german state of hesse hassia in latin home to the facility in this name was accepted as final in introduction to the heaviest elements the heaviest atomic nuclei are created in nuclear reactions that

was definitely created and there is no other explanation for the observed effects errors in interpreting data have been made discovery cold fusion nuclear reactions used in the s resulted in high excitation energies that required expulsion of four or five neutrons these reactions used targets made of elements with high atomic numbers to maximize the size difference between the two nuclei in a reaction while this increased the chance of fusion due to the lower electrostatic repulsion between the target and the projectile the formed compound nuclei often broke apart and did not survive to form a new element moreover fusion processes inevitably produce neutron poor nuclei as heavier elements require more neutrons per proton to maximize stability therefore the necessary ejection of neutrons results in final products with typically have shorter lifetimes as such light beams six to ten protons allowed synthesis of elements only up to to advance to heavier elements soviet physicist yuri oganessian at the joint institute for nuclear research jinr in dubna moscow oblast russian sfsr soviet union proposed a different mechanism in which the bombarded nucleus would be lead which has magic numbers of protons and neutrons or another nucleus close to it each proton and neutron has a fixed value of rest energy those of all protons are equal and so are those of all neutrons in a nucleus some of this energy is diverted to binding protons and neutrons if a nucleus has a magic number of protons and or neutrons then even more of its rest energy is diverted which gives the nuclide additional stability this additional stability requires more energy for an external nucleus to break the existing one and penetrate it more energy diverted to binding nucleons means less rest energy which in turn means less mass mass is proportional to rest energy more equal atomic numbers of the reacting nuclei result in greater electrostatic repulsion between them but the lower mass excess of the target nucleus balances it this leaves less excitation energy for the newly created compound nucleus which necessitates fewer neutron ejections to reach a stable state because of this energy difference the former mechanism became known as hot fusion and the latter as cold fusion cold fusion was first declared successful in at jinr when it was tested for synthesis of the yet undiscovered element these new nuclei were projected to decay via spontaneous fission the physicists at jinr concluded element was produced in the experiment because no fissioning nucleus known at the time showed parameters of fission similar to what was observed during the experiment and because changing either of the two nuclei in the reactions negated the observed effects physicists at the lawrence berkeley laboratory lbl originally radiation laboratory rl and later lawrence berkeley national laboratory lbnl of the university of california in berkeley california united states also expressed great interest in the new technique when asked about how far this new method could go and if lead targets were a physics klondike oganessian responded klondike may be an exaggeration but soon we will try to get elements in these reactions reports the synthesis of element was first attempted in by a research team led by oganessian at the jinr the team used a reaction that would generate element specifically the isotope from fusion of radium specifically the isotope ra and calcium ca the researchers were uncertain in interpreting their data and their paper did not unambiguously claim to have discovered the element the same year another team at jinr investigated the possibility of synthesis of element in reactions between lead pb and iron fe they were uncertain in interpreting the data suggesting the possibility that element had not been created in new experiments were performed at jinr the experiments probably resulted in the synthesis of element bismuth bi was bombarded with manganese mn to obtain lead pb pb was bombarded with iron fe to obtain and californium cf was bombarded with neon ne to obtain these experiments were not claimed as a discovery and oganessian announced them in a conference rather than in a written report in jinr researchers in dubna performed experiments set up identically to the previous ones they bombarded bismuth and lead targets with ions of lighter elements manganese and iron respectively twenty one spontaneous fission events were recorded the researchers concluded they were caused by later in a research team led by peter armbruster and gottfried m nzenberg at gesellschaft f r schwerionenforschung gsi institute for heavy ion research in darmstadt hesse west germany attempted to create element the team bombarded a lead pb target with accelerated iron fe nuclei gsi s experiment to create element was delayed until after their creation of element in as prior calculations had suggested that even even isotopes of element would have spontaneous fission half lives of less than one microsecond making them difficult to detect and identify the element experiment finally went ahead after had been synthesized and was found to decay by alpha emission suggesting that isotopes of element would do likewise and this was corroborated by an experiment aimed at synthesizing isotopes of element gsi reported synthesis of three atoms of two years later they reported synthesis of one atom of the even even arbitration in the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac and the international union of pure and applied physics iupap formed the transfermium working group twg to assess discoveries and establish final names for elements with atomic numbers greater than the party held meetings with delegates from the three competing institutes in they established criteria for recognition of an element and in they finished the work of assessing discoveries and disbanded these results were published in according to the report the works from jinr and gsi simultaneously and independently established synthesis of element of the two works the one from gsi was said to be sufficient as a discovery on its own the jinr work which preceded the gsi one very probably displayed synthesis of element however that was determined in retrospect given the work from darmstadt the jinr work focused on chemically identifying remote granddaughters of element isotopes which could not exclude the possibility that these daughter isotopes had other progenitors while the gsi work clearly identified the decay path of those element isotopes the report concluded that the major credit should be awarded to gsi in written responses to this ruling both jinr and gsi agreed with its conclusions in the same response gsi confirmed that they and jinr were able to resolve all conflicts between them naming historically a newly discovered element was named by its discoverer the first regulation came in when iupac decided naming required regulation in case there are conflicting names these matters were to be resolved by the commission of inorganic nomenclature and the commission of atomic weights they would review the names in case of a conflict and select one the decision would be based on a number of factors such as usage and would not be an indicator of priority of a claim the two commissions would recommend a name to the iupac council which would be the final authority the discoverers held the right to name an element but their name would be subject to approval by iupac the commission of atomic weights distanced itself from element naming in most cases under mendeleev s nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements hassium would be known as eka osmium as in the first element below osmium in the periodic table from sanskrit eka meaning one in iupac published recommendations according to which the element was to be called unniloctium and assigned the corresponding symbol of uno a systematic element name as a placeholder until the element was discovered and the discovery then confirmed and a permanent name was decided although these recommendations were widely followed in the chemical community the competing physicists in the field ignored them they either called it element with the symbols e or or used the proposed name hassium in in an attempt to break a deadlock in establishing priority of discovery and naming of several elements iupac reaffirmed in its nomenclature of inorganic chemistry that after existence of an element was established the discoverers could propose a name in addition the commission of atomic weights was excluded from the naming process the first publication on criteria for an element discovery released in specified the need for recognition by twg armbruster and his colleagues the officially recognized german discoverers held a naming ceremony for the elements through which had all been recognized as discovered by gsi on september for element the scientists proposed the name hassium it is derived from the latin name hassia for the german state of hesse where the institute is located this name was proposed to iupac in a written response to their ruling on priority of discovery claims of elements signed september the process of naming of element was a part of a larger process of naming a number of elements starting with element three teams jinr gsi and lbl claimed discoveries of several elements and the right to name those elements sometimes these claims clashed since a discoverer was considered entitled to naming of an element conflicts over priority of discovery often resulted in conflicts over names of these new elements these conflicts became known as the transfermium wars different suggestions to name the whole set of elements from onward and they occasionally assigned names suggested by one team to be used for elements discovered by another however not all suggestions were met with equal approval the teams openly protested naming proposals on several occasions in iupac commission on nomenclature of inorganic chemistry recommended that element be named hahnium hn after the german physicist otto hahn so elements named after hahn and lise meitner it was recommended element should be named meitnerium following gsi s suggestion would be next to each other honouring their joint discovery of nuclear fission iupac commented that they felt the german suggestion was obscure gsi protested saying this proposal contradicted the long standing convention of giving the discoverer the right to suggest a name the american chemical society supported gsi the name hahnium albeit with the different symbol ha had already been proposed and used by the american scientists for element for which they had a discovery dispute with jinr they thus protested the confusing scrambling of names following the uproar iupac formed an ad hoc committee of representatives from the national adhering organizations of the three countries home to the competing institutions they produced a new set of names in element was again named hahnium this proposal was also retracted the final compromise was reached in and published in element was named hassium hs simultaneously the name dubnium db from dubna the jinr location was assigned to element and the name hahnium was not used for any element the official justification for this naming alongside that of darmstadtium for element was that it completed a set of geographic names for the location of the gsi this set had been initiated by th century names europium and germanium this set would serve as a response to earlier naming of americium californium and berkelium for elements discovered in berkeley armbruster commented on this this bad tradition was established by berkeley we wanted to do it for europe later when commenting on the naming of element armbruster said i did everything to ensure that we do not continue with german scientists and german towns isotopes hassium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements as of the quantity of all hassium ever produced was on the order of hundreds of atoms twelve isotopes with mass numbers ranging from to with the exceptions of and have been reported four of which hassium and have known metastable states although that of hassium is unconfirmed most of these isotopes decay predominantly through alpha decay this is the most common for all isotopes for which comprehensive decay characteristics are available the only exception being hassium which undergoes spontaneous fission lighter isotopes were usually synthesized by direct fusion between two lighter nuclei whereas heavier isotopes were typically observed as decay products of nuclei with larger atomic numbers atomic nuclei have well established nuclear shells and the existence of these shells provides nuclei with additional stability if a nucleus has certain numbers of protons or neutrons called magic numbers that complete certain nuclear shells then the nucleus is even more stable against decay the highest known magic numbers are for protons and for neutrons this notion is sometimes expanded to include additional numbers between those magic numbers which also provide some additional stability and indicate closure of sub shells in contrast to the better known lighter nuclei superheavy nuclei are deformed until the s the liquid drop model was the dominant explanation for nuclear structure it suggested that the fission barrier would disappear for nuclei with about nucleons it was thus thought that spontaneous fission would occur nearly instantly before nuclei could form a structure that could stabilize them it appeared that nuclei with z were too heavy to exist for a considerable length of time the later nuclear shell model suggested that nuclei with about three hundred nucleons would form an island of stability in which nuclei will be more resistant to spontaneous fission and will primarily undergo alpha decay with longer half lives and the next doubly magic nucleus having magic numbers of both protons and neutrons is expected to lie in the center of the island of stability in the vicinity of z and the predicted magic neutron number n subsequent discoveries suggested that the predicted island might be further than originally anticipated they also showed that nuclei intermediate between the long lived actinides and the predicted island are deformed and gain additional stability from shell effects the addition to the stability against the spontaneous fission should be particularly great against spontaneous fission although increase in stability against the alpha decay would also be pronounced the center of the region on a chart of nuclides that would correspond to this stability for deformed nuclei was determined as hs with expected to be a magic number for protons for deformed nuclei nuclei that are far from spherical and a magic number for neutrons for such nuclei experiments on lighter superheavy nuclei as well as those closer to the expected island have shown greater than previously anticipated stability against spontaneous fission showing the importance of shell effects on nuclei theoretical models predict a region of instability for some hassium isotopes to lie around a and n which is between the predicted neutron shell closures at n for deformed nuclei and n for spherical nuclei nuclides within this region are predicted to have low fission barrier heights resulting in short partial half lives toward spontaneous fission this prediction is supported by the observed eleven millisecond half life of hs and that of the neighbouring isobar mt because the hindrance factors from the odd nucleon were shown to be much lower than otherwise expected the measured half lives are even lower than those predicted for the even even hs and ds which suggests a gap in stability away from the shell closures and perhaps a weakening of the shell closures in this region in polish physicists zygmunt patyk and adam sobiczewski predicted that is a proton magic number for deformed nuclei and is a neutron magic number for such nuclei this means such nuclei are permanently deformed in their ground state but have high narrow fission barriers to further deformation and hence relatively long life times toward spontaneous fission computational prospects for shell stabilization for hs made it a promising candidate for a deformed doubly magic nucleus experimental data is scarce but the existing data is interpreted by the researchers to support the assignment of n as a magic number in particular this conclusion was drawn from the decay data of hs hs and hs in polish physicist robert smola czuk calculated that the isotope hs may be the most stable superheavy nucleus against alpha decay and spontaneous fission as a consequence of the predicted n shell closure natural occurrence hassium is not known to occur naturally on earth the half lives of all its known isotopes are short enough that no primordial hassium would have survived to the present day this does not rule out the possibility of the existence of unknown longer lived isotopes or nuclear isomers some of which could still exist in trace quantities if they are long lived enough as early as german physicist richard swinne proposed element as a source of x rays in the greenland ice sheet although swinne was unable to verify this observation and thus did not claim discovery he proposed in the existence of regions of long lived transuranic elements including one around z in soviet geologist and physicist viktor cherdyntsev who had previously claimed the existence of primordial curium claimed to have discovered element specifically the isotope which supposedly had a half life of to million years in natural molybdenite and suggested the provisional name sergenium symbol sg this name takes its origin from the name for the silk road and was explained as coming from kazakhstan for it his rationale for claiming that sergenium was the heavier homologue to osmium was that minerals supposedly containing sergenium formed volatile oxides when boiled in nitric acid similarly to osmium cherdyntsev s findings were criticized by soviet physicist vladimir kulakov on the grounds that some of the properties cherdyntsev claimed sergenium had were inconsistent with the then current nuclear physics the chief questions raised by kulakov were that the claimed alpha decay energy of sergenium was many orders of magnitude lower than expected and the half life given was eight orders of magnitude shorter than what would be predicted for a nuclide alpha decaying with the claimed decay energy at the same time a corrected half life in the region of years would be impossible because it would imply the samples contained about a hundred milligrams of sergenium in it was suggested that the observed alpha decay with energy mev could be due to a low energy and strongly enhanced transition between different hyperdeformed states of a hassium isotope around hs thus suggesting that the existence of superheavy elements in nature was at least possible although unlikely in russian geologist alexei ivanov hypothesized that an isomer of hs might have a half life of around years which would explain the observation of alpha particles with energies of around mev in some samples of molybdenite and osmiridium this isomer of hs could be produced from the beta decay of bh and sg which being homologous to rhenium and molybdenum respectively should occur in molybdenite along with rhenium and molybdenum if they occurred in nature because hassium is homologous to osmium it should occur along with osmium in osmiridium if it occurs in nature the decay chains of bh and sg are hypothetical and the predicted half life of this hypothetical hassium isomer is not long enough for any sufficient quantity to remain on earth it is possible that more hs may be deposited on the earth as the solar system travels through the spiral arms of the milky way this would explain excesses of plutonium found on the ocean floors of the pacific ocean and the gulf of finland however minerals enriched with hs are predicted to have excesses of its daughters uranium and lead they would also have different proportions of elements that are formed during spontaneous fission such as krypton zirconium and xenon the natural occurrence of hassium in minerals such as molybdenite and osmiride is theoretically possible but very unlikely in jinr started a search for natural hassium in the modane underground laboratory in modane auvergne rh ne alpes france this was done underground to avoid interference and false positives from cosmic rays in an experiment run in the laboratory resulted in detection of several registered events of neutron multiplicity number of emitted free neutrons after a nucleus hit has been hit by a neutron and fissioned above three in natural osmium and in these findings were reaffirmed in another experiment run in the laboratory these results hinted natural hassium could potentially exist in nature in amounts that allow its detection by the means of analytical chemistry but this conclusion is based on an explicit assumption that there is a long lived hassium isotope to which the registered events could be attributed since hs may be particularly stable against alpha decay and spontaneous fission it was considered as a candidate to exist in nature this nuclide however is predicted to be very unstable toward beta decay and any beta stable isotopes of hassium such as hs would be too unstable in the other decay channels to be observed in nature a search for hs in nature along with its homologue osmium at the maier leibnitz laboratory in garching bavaria germany was unsuccessful setting an upper limit to its abundance at grams of hassium per gram of osmium predicted properties various calculations suggest hassium should be the heaviest group element so far consistently with the periodic law its properties should generally match those expected for a heavier homologue of osmium as is the case for all transactinides a few deviations are expected to arise from relativistic effects very few properties of hassium or its compounds have been measured this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that hassium and its parents decays very quickly a few singular chemistry related properties have been measured such as enthalpy of adsorption of hassium tetroxide but properties of hassium metal remain unknown and only predictions are available relativistic effects relativistic effects on hassium should arise due to the high charge of its nuclei which causes the electrons around the nucleus to move faster so fast their velocity becomes comparable to the speed of light there are three main effects the direct relativistic effect the indirect relativistic effect and spin orbit splitting the existing calculations do not account for breit interactions but those are negligible and their omission can only result in an uncertainty of the current calculations of no more than as atomic number increases so does the electrostatic attraction between an electron and the nucleus this causes the velocity of the electron to increase which leads to an increase in its mass this in turn leads to contraction of the atomic orbitals most specifically the s and p orbitals their electrons become more closely attached to the atom and harder to pull from the nucleus this is the direct relativistic effect it was originally thought to be strong only for the innermost electrons but was later established to significantly influence valence electrons as well since the s and p orbitals are closer to the nucleus they take a bigger portion of the electric charge of the nucleus on themselves shield it this leaves less charge for attraction of the remaining electrons whose orbitals therefore expand making them easier to pull from the nucleus this is the indirect relativistic effect as a result of the combination of the direct and indirect relativistic effects the hs ion compared to the neutral atom lacks a d electron rather than a s electron in comparison os lacks a s electron compared to the neutral atom the ionic radius in oxidation state of hassium is greater than that of osmium because of the relativistic expansion of the p orbitals which are the outermost orbitals for an hs ion although in practice such highly charged ions would be too polarised in chemical environments to have much reality there are several kinds of electronic orbitals denoted by the letters s p d and f g orbitals are expected to start being chemically active among elements after element each of these corresponds to an azimuthal quantum number l s to p to d to and f to every electron also corresponds to a spin quantum number s which may equal either or thus the total angular momentum quantum number j l s is equal to j l except for l for which for both electrons in each orbital j spin of an electron relativistically interacts with its orbit and this interaction leads to a split of a subshell into two with different energies the one with j l is lower in energy and thus these electrons more difficult to extract for instance of the six p electrons two become p and four become p this is the spin orbit splitting sometimes also referred to as subshell splitting or jj coupling it is most visible with p electrons which do not play an important role in the chemistry of hassium but those for d and f electrons are within the same order of magnitude quantitatively spin orbit splitting in expressed in energy units such as electronvolts these relativistic effects are responsible for the expected increase of the ionization energy decrease of the electron affinity and increase of stability of the oxidation state compared to osmium without them the trends would be reversed relativistic effects decrease the atomization energies of the compounds of hassium because the spin orbit splitting of the d orbital lowers binding energy between electrons and the nucleus and because relativistic effects decrease ionic character in bonding physical and atomic the previous members of group have relatively high melting points fe c ru c os c much like them hassium is predicted to be a solid at room temperature although its melting point has not been precisely calculated hassium should crystallize in the hexagonal close packed structure c a similarly to its lighter congener osmium pure metallic hassium is calculated to have a bulk modulus resistance to uniform compression of gpa comparable with that of diamond gpa hassium is expected to be one of the densest of the known elements with a predicted density of g cm vs the g cm measured for osmium the atomic radius of hassium is expected to be around pm due to the relativistic stabilization of the s orbital and destabilization of the d orbital the hs ion is predicted to have an electron configuration of rn f d s giving up a d electron instead of a s electron which is the opposite of the behaviour of its lighter homologues the hs ion is expected to have an electron configuration of rn f d s analogous to that calculated for the os ion in chemical compounds hassium is calculated to display bonding characteristic for a d block element whose bonding will be primarily executed by d and d orbitals compared to the elements from the previous periods s p p and p orbitals should be more important chemical hassium is the sixth member of the d series of transition metals and is expected to be much like the platinum group metals some of these properties were confirmed by gas phase chemistry experiments the group elements portray a wide variety of oxidation states but ruthenium and osmium readily portray their group oxidation state of this state becomes more stable down the group this oxidation state is extremely rare among stable elements only ruthenium osmium and xenon are able to attain it in reasonably stable compounds hassium is expected to follow its congeners and have a stable state but like them it should show lower stable oxidation states such as and hassium iv is expected to be more stable than hassium viii in aqueous solution hassium should be a rather noble metal the standard reduction potential for the hs hs couple is expected to be v the group elements show a distinctive oxide chemistry all the lighter members have known or hypothetical tetroxides mo their oxidizing power decreases as one descends the group feo is not known due to its extraordinarily large electron affinity the amount of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom or molecule to form a negative ion which results in the formation of the well known oxyanion ferrate vi feo ruthenium tetroxide ruo which is formed by oxidation of ruthenium vi in acid readily undergoes reduction to ruthenate vi ruo oxidation of ruthenium metal in air forms the dioxide ruo in contrast osmium burns to form the stable tetroxide oso which complexes with the hydroxide ion to form an osmium viii ate complex oso oh therefore hassium should behave as a heavier homologue of osmium by forming of a stable very volatile tetroxide hso which undergoes complexation with hydroxide to form a hassate viii hso oh ruthenium tetroxide and osmium tetroxide are both volatile due to their symmetrical tetrahedral molecular geometry and because they are charge neutral hassium tetroxide should similarly be a very volatile solid the trend of the volatilities of the group tetroxides is experimentally known to be ruo oso hso which confirms the calculated results in particular the calculated enthalpies of adsorption the energy required for the adhesion of atoms molecules or ions from a gas liquid or dissolved solid to a surface of hso kj mol on quartz agrees very well with the experimental value of kj mol experimental chemistry the first goal for chemical investigation was the formation of the tetroxide it was chosen because ruthenium and osmium form volatile tetroxides being the only transition metals to display a stable compound in the oxidation state despite this selection for gas phase chemical studies being clear from the beginning chemical characterization of hassium was considered a difficult task for a long time although hassium isotopes were first synthesized in it was not until that a hassium isotope long lived enough to allow chemical studies was synthesized unfortunately this hassium isotope hs was synthesized indirectly from the decay of cn not only are indirect synthesis methods not favourable for chemical studies but the reaction that produced the isotope cn had a low yield its cross section was only pb and thus did not provide enough hassium atoms for a chemical investigation direct synthesis of hs and hs in the reaction cm mg xn xhs x or appeared more promising because the cross section for this reaction was somewhat larger at pb this yield was still around ten times lower than that for the reaction used for the chemical characterization of bohrium new techniques for irradiation separation and detection had to be introduced before hassium could be successfully characterized chemically ruthenium and osmium have very similar chemistry due to the lanthanide contraction but iron shows some differences from them for example although ruthenium and osmium form stable tetroxides in which the metal is in the oxidation state iron does not in preparation for the chemical characterization of hassium research focused on ruthenium and osmium rather than iron because hassium was expected to be similar to ruthenium and osmium as the predicted data on hassium closely matched that of those two the first chemistry experiments were performed using gas thermochromatography in using the synthetic osmium radioisotopes os and os as a reference during the experiment seven hassium atoms were synthesized using the reactions cm mg n hs and cm mg n hs they were then thermalized and oxidized in a mixture of helium and oxygen gases to form hassium tetroxide molecules hs o hso the measured deposition temperature of hassium tetroxide was higher than that of osmium tetroxide which indicated the former was the less volatile one and this placed hassium firmly in group the enthalpy of adsorption for hso measured kj mol was significantly lower than the predicted value kj mol indicating oso is more volatile than hso contradicting earlier calculations that implied they should have very similar volatilities for comparison the value for oso is kj mol the calculations that yielded a closer match to the experimental data came after the experiment in it is possible hassium tetroxide interacts differently with silicon nitride than with silicon dioxide the chemicals used for the detector further research is required to establish whether there is a difference between such interactions and whether it has influenced the measurements such research would include more accurate measurements of the nuclear properties of hs and comparisons with ruo in addition to oso in scientists reacted hassium tetroxide and sodium hydroxide to form sodium hassate viii a reaction that is well known with osmium this was the first acid base reaction with a hassium compound forming sodium hassate viii hso naoh na hso oh the team from the university of mainz planned in to study the electrodeposition of hassium atoms using the new tasca facility at gsi their aim was to use the reaction ra ca n hs scientists at gsi were hoping to use tasca to study the synthesis and properties of the hassium ii compound hassocene hs c h using the reaction ra ca xn this compound is analogous to the lighter compounds ferrocene ruthenocene and osmocene and is expected to have the two cyclopentadienyl rings in an eclipsed conformation like ruthenocene and osmocene and not in a staggered conformation like ferrocene hassocene which is expected to be a stable and highly volatile compound was chosen because it has hassium in the low formal oxidation state of although the bonding between the metal and the rings is mostly covalent in metallocenes rather than the high state that had previously been investigated and relativistic effects were expected to be stronger in the lower oxidation state the highly symmetrical structure of hassocene and its low number of atoms make relativistic calculations easier as of there are no experimental reports of hassocene ,108
Meitnerium,Mt,meitnerium is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol mt and atomic number it is an extremely radioactive synthetic element an element not found in nature but can be created in a laboratory the most stable known isotope meitnerium has a half life of seconds although the unconfirmed meitnerium may have a longer half life of seconds the gsi helmholtz centre for heavy ion research near darmstadt germany first created this element in it is named after lise meitner in the periodic table meitnerium is a d block transactinide element it is a member of the th period and is placed in the group elements although no chemical experiments have yet been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to iridium in group as the seventh member of the d series of transition metals meitnerium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues cobalt rhodium and iridium introduction the heaviest atomic nuclei are created in nuclear reactions that combine two other nuclei of unequal size into one roughly the more unequal the two nuclei in terms of mass the greater the possibility that the two react the material made of the heavier nuclei is made into a target which is then bombarded by the beam of lighter nuclei two nuclei can only fuse into one if they approach each other closely enough normally nuclei all positively charged repel each other due to electrostatic repulsion the strong interaction can overcome this repulsion but only within a very short distance from a nucleus beam nuclei are thus greatly accelerated in order to make such repulsion insignificant compared to the velocity of the beam nucleus coming close alone is not enough for two nuclei to fuse when two nuclei approach each other they usually remain together for approximately seconds and then part ways not necessarily in the same composition as before the reaction rather than form a single nucleus if fusion does occur the temporary merger termed a compound nucleus is an excited state to lose its excitation energy and reach a more stable state a compound nucleus either fissions or ejects one or several neutrons which carry away the energy this occurs in approximately seconds after the initial collision the beam passes through the target and reaches the next chamber the separator if a new nucleus is produced it is carried with this beam in the separator the newly produced nucleus is separated from other nuclides that of the original beam and any other reaction products and transferred to a surface barrier detector which stops the nucleus the exact location of the upcoming impact on the detector is marked also marked are its energy and the time of the arrival the transfer takes about seconds in order to be detected the nucleus must survive this long the nucleus is recorded again once its decay is registered and the location the energy and the time of the decay are measured stability of a nucleus is provided by the strong interaction however its range is very short as nuclei become larger their influence on the outermost nucleons protons and neutrons weakens at the same time the nucleus is torn apart by electrostatic repulsion between protons as it has unlimited range nuclei of the heaviest elements are thus theoretically predicted and have so far been observed to primarily decay via decay modes that are caused by such repulsion alpha decay and spontaneous fission these modes are predominant for nuclei of superheavy elements alpha decays are registered by the emitted alpha particles and the decay products are easy to determine before the actual decay if such a decay or a series of consecutive decays produces a known nucleus the original product of a reaction can be determined arithmetically spontaneous fission however produces various nuclei as products so the original nuclide cannot be determined from its daughters the information available to physicists aiming to synthesize one of the heaviest elements is thus the information collected at the detectors location energy and time of arrival of a particle to the detector and those of its decay the physicists analyze this data and seek to conclude that it was indeed caused by a new element and could not have been caused by a different nuclide than the one claimed often provided data is insufficient for a conclusion that a new element was definitely created and there is no other explanation for the observed effects errors in interpreting data have been made history discovery meitnerium was first synthesized on august by a german research team led by peter armbruster and gottfried m nzenberg at the institute for heavy ion research gesellschaft f r schwerionenforschung in darmstadt the team bombarded a target of bismuth with accelerated nuclei of iron and detected a single atom of the isotope meitnerium bi fe mt nthis work was confirmed three years later at the joint institute for nuclear research at dubna then in the soviet union naming using mendeleev s nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements meitnerium should be known as eka iridium in during the transfermium wars but before the synthesis of meitnerium iupac published recommendations according to which the element was to be called unnilennium with the corresponding symbol of une a systematic element name as a placeholder until the element was discovered and the discovery then confirmed and a permanent name was decided on although widely used in the chemical community on all levels from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field who either called it element with the symbol of e or even simply or used the proposed name meitnerium the naming of meitnerium was discussed in the element naming controversy regarding the names of elements to but meitnerium was the only proposal and thus was never disputed the name meitnerium mt was suggested by the gsi team in september in honor of the austrian physicist lise meitner a co discoverer of protactinium with otto hahn and one of the discoverers of nuclear fission in the name was recommended by iupac and was officially adopted in it is thus the only element named specifically after a non mythological woman curium being named for both pierre and marie curie isotopes meitnerium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements eight different isotopes of meitnerium have been reported with atomic masses and two of which meitnerium and meitnerium have known but unconfirmed metastable states a ninth isotope with atomic mass is unconfirmed most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay although some undergo spontaneous fission stability and half lives all meitnerium isotopes are extremely unstable and radioactive in general heavier isotopes are more stable than the lighter the most stable known meitnerium isotope mt is also the heaviest known it has a half life of seconds the unconfirmed mt is even heavier and appears to have a longer half life of seconds the isotopes mt and mt have half lives of and seconds respectively the remaining five isotopes have half lives between and milliseconds the isotope mt created as the final decay product of ts for the first time in was observed to undergo spontaneous fission with a half life of milliseconds preliminary data analysis considered the possibility of this fission event instead originating from hs for it also has a half life of a few milliseconds and could be populated following undetected electron capture somewhere along the decay chain this possibility was later deemed very unlikely based on observed decay energies of ds and rg and the short half life of mt although there is still some uncertainty of the assignment regardless the rapid fission of mt and hs is strongly suggestive of a region of instability for superheavy nuclei with n the existence of this region characterized by a decrease in fission barrier height between the deformed shell closure at n and spherical shell closure at n is consistent with theoretical models predicted properties other than nuclear properties no properties of meitnerium or its compounds have been measured this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that meitnerium and its parents decay very quickly properties of meitnerium metal remain unknown and only predictions are available chemical meitnerium is the seventh member of the d series of transition metals and should be much like the platinum group metals calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue iridium thus implying that meitnerium s basic properties will resemble those of the other group elements cobalt rhodium and iridium prediction of the probable chemical properties of meitnerium has not received much attention recently meitnerium is expected to be a noble metal the standard electrode potential for the mt mt couple is expected to be v based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group elements the most stable oxidation states of meitnerium are predicted to be the and states with the state being the most stable in aqueous solutions in comparison rhodium and iridium show a maximum oxidation state of while the most stable states are and for iridium and for rhodium the oxidation state represented only by iridium in iro might be possible for its congener meitnerium in the nonafluoride mtf and the mto cation although iro is expected to be more stable than these meitnerium compounds the tetrahalides of meitnerium have also been predicted to have similar stabilities to those of iridium thus also allowing a stable state it is further expected that the maximum oxidation states of elements from bohrium element to darmstadtium element may be stable in the gas phase but not in aqueous solution physical and atomic meitnerium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a face centered cubic crystal structure similarly to its lighter congener iridium it should be a very heavy metal with a density of around g cm which would be among the highest of any of the known elements meitnerium is also predicted to be paramagnetic theoreticians have predicted the covalent radius of meitnerium to be to pm larger than that of iridium the atomic radius of meitnerium is expected to be around pm experimental chemistry meitnerium is the first element on the periodic table whose chemistry has not yet been investigated unambiguous determination of the chemical characteristics of meitnerium has yet to have been established due to the short half lives of meitnerium isotopes and a limited number of likely volatile compounds that could be studied on a very small scale one of the few meitnerium compounds that are likely to be sufficiently volatile is meitnerium hexafluoride mtf as its lighter homologue iridium hexafluoride irf is volatile above c and therefore the analogous compound of meitnerium might also be sufficiently volatile a volatile octafluoride mtf might also be possible for chemical studies to be carried out on a transactinide at least four atoms must be produced the half life of the isotope used must be at least second and the rate of production must be at least one atom per week even though the half life of mt the most stable confirmed meitnerium isotope is seconds long enough to perform chemical studies another obstacle is the need to increase the rate of production of meitnerium isotopes and allow experiments to carry on for weeks or months so that statistically significant results can be obtained separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the meitnerium isotopes and have automated systems experiment on the gas phase and solution chemistry of meitnerium as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements some of the separation techniques used for bohrium and hassium could be reused however the experimental chemistry of meitnerium has not received as much attention as that of the heavier elements from copernicium to livermorium the lawrence berkeley national laboratory attempted to synthesize the isotope mt in for a possible chemical investigation of meitnerium because it was expected that it might be more stable than the isotopes around it as it has neutrons a magic number for deformed nuclei its half life was predicted to be a few seconds long enough for a chemical investigation however no atoms of mt were detected and this isotope of meitnerium is currently unknown an experiment determining the chemical properties of a transactinide would need to compare a compound of that transactinide with analogous compounds of some of its lighter homologues for example in the chemical characterization of hassium hassium tetroxide hso was compared with the analogous osmium compound osmium tetroxide oso in a preliminary step towards determining the chemical properties of meitnerium the gsi attempted sublimation of the rhodium compounds rhodium iii oxide rh o and rhodium iii chloride rhcl however macroscopic amounts of the oxide would not sublimate until c and the chloride would not until c and then only in the presence of carbon aerosol particles these temperatures are far too high for such procedures to be used on meitnerium as most of the current methods used for the investigation of the chemistry of superheavy elements do not work above c following the successful synthesis of seaborgium hexacarbonyl sg co studies were conducted with the stable transition metals of groups through suggesting that carbonyl formation could be extended to further probe the chemistries of the early d transition metals from rutherfordium to meitnerium inclusive nevertheless the challenges of low half lives and difficult production reactions make meitnerium difficult to access for radiochemists though the isotopes mt and mt are long lived enough for chemical research and may be produced in the decay chains of ts and mc respectively mt is likely more suitable since producing tennessine requires a rare and rather short lived berkelium target the isotope mt observed in the decay chain of nh with a half life of seconds may also be sufficiently long lived for chemical investigations though a direct synthesis route leading to this isotope and more precise measurements of its decay properties would be required ,109
Darmstadtium,Ds,darmstadtium is a chemical element with the symbol ds and atomic number it is an extremely radioactive synthetic element the most stable known isotope darmstadtium has a half life of approximately seconds darmstadtium was first created in by the gsi helmholtz centre for heavy ion research in the city of darmstadt germany after which it was named in the periodic table it is a d block transactinide element it is a member of the th period and is placed in the group elements although no chemical experiments have yet been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to platinum in group as the eighth member of the d series of transition metals darmstadtium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues nickel palladium and platinum introduction the heaviest atomic nuclei are created in nuclear reactions that combine two other nuclei of unequal size into one roughly the more unequal the two nuclei in terms of mass the greater the possibility that the two react the material made of the heavier nuclei is made into a target which is then bombarded by the beam of lighter nuclei two nuclei can only fuse into one if they approach each other closely enough normally nuclei all positively charged repel each other due to electrostatic repulsion the strong interaction can overcome this repulsion but only within a very short distance from a nucleus beam nuclei are thus greatly accelerated in order to make such repulsion insignificant compared to the velocity of the beam nucleus coming close alone is not enough for two nuclei to fuse when two nuclei approach each other they usually remain together for approximately seconds and then part ways not necessarily in the same composition as before the reaction rather than form a single nucleus if fusion does occur the temporary merger termed a compound nucleus is an excited state to lose its excitation energy and reach a more stable state a compound nucleus either fissions or ejects one or several neutrons which carry away the energy this occurs in approximately seconds after the initial collision the beam passes through the target and reaches the next chamber the separator if a new nucleus is produced it is carried with this beam in the separator the newly produced nucleus is separated from other nuclides that of the original beam and any other reaction products and transferred to a surface barrier detector which stops the nucleus the exact location of the upcoming impact on the detector is marked also marked are its energy and the time of the arrival the transfer takes about seconds in order to be detected the nucleus must survive this long the nucleus is recorded again once its decay is registered and the location the energy and the time of the decay are measured stability of a nucleus is provided by the strong interaction however its range is very short as nuclei become larger their influence on the outermost nucleons protons and neutrons weakens at the same time the nucleus is torn apart by electrostatic repulsion between protons as it has unlimited range nuclei of the heaviest elements are thus theoretically predicted and have so far been observed to primarily decay via decay modes that are caused by such repulsion alpha decay and spontaneous fission these modes are predominant for nuclei of superheavy elements alpha decays are registered by the emitted alpha particles and the decay products are easy to determine before the actual decay if such a decay or a series of consecutive decays produces a known nucleus the original product of a reaction can be determined arithmetically spontaneous fission however produces various nuclei as products so the original nuclide cannot be determined from its daughters the information available to physicists aiming to synthesize one of the heaviest elements is thus the information collected at the detectors location energy and time of arrival of a particle to the detector and those of its decay the physicists analyze this data and seek to conclude that it was indeed caused by a new element and could not have been caused by a different nuclide than the one claimed often provided data is insufficient for a conclusion that a new element was definitely created and there is no other explanation for the observed effects errors in interpreting data have been made history discovery darmstadtium was first created on november at the institute for heavy ion research gesellschaft f r schwerionenforschung gsi in darmstadt germany by peter armbruster and gottfried m nzenberg under the direction of sigurd hofmann the team bombarded a lead target with accelerated nuclei of nickel in a heavy ion accelerator and detected a single atom of the isotope darmstadtium pb ni ds n two more atoms followed on november and yet another was originally reported to have been found on november but it turned out to be based on data fabricated by victor ninov and was then retracted in the same series of experiments the same team also carried out the reaction using heavier nickel ions during two runs atoms of ds were convincingly detected by correlation with known daughter decay properties pb ni ds n prior to this there had been failed synthesis attempts in at the joint institute for nuclear research in dubna then in the soviet union and in at the gsi a attempt at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory resulted in signs suggesting but not pointing conclusively at the discovery of a new isotope ds formed in the bombardment of bi with co and a similarly inconclusive attempt at the jinr showed signs of ds being produced from pu and s each team proposed its own name for element the american team proposed hahnium after otto hahn in an attempt to resolve the controversy of naming element which they had long been suggesting this name for the russian team proposed becquerelium after henri becquerel and the german team proposed darmstadtium after darmstadt the location of their institute the iupac iupap joint working party jwp recognised the gsi team as discoverers in their report giving them the right to suggest a name for the element naming using mendeleev s nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements darmstadtium should be known as eka platinum in iupac published recommendations according to which the element was to be called ununnilium with the corresponding symbol of uun a systematic element name as a placeholder until the element was discovered and the discovery then confirmed and a permanent name was decided on although widely used in the chemical community on all levels from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field who called it element with the symbol of e or even simply in the russian team proposed the name becquerelium after henri becquerel the american team in proposed the name hahnium after otto hahn previously this name had been used for element the name darmstadtium ds was suggested by the gsi team in honor of the city of darmstadt where the element was discovered the gsi team originally also considered naming the element wixhausium after the suburb of darmstadt known as wixhausen where the element was discovered but eventually decided on darmstadtium policium had also been proposed as a joke due to the emergency telephone number in germany being the new name darmstadtium was officially recommended by iupac on august isotopes darmstadtium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements ten different isotopes of darmstadtium have been reported with atomic masses and although darmstadtium is unconfirmed three darmstadtium isotopes darmstadtium darmstadtium and darmstadtium have known metastable states although that of darmstadtium is unconfirmed most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay but some undergo spontaneous fission stability and half lives all darmstadtium isotopes are extremely unstable and radioactive in general the heavier isotopes are more stable than the lighter the most stable known darmstadtium isotope ds is also the heaviest known darmstadtium isotope it has a half life of seconds the isotope ds has a half life of seconds while the unconfirmed mds has a half life of seconds the remaining seven isotopes and two metastable states have half lives between microsecond and milliseconds some unknown darmstadtium isotopes may have longer half lives however theoretical calculation in a quantum tunneling model reproduces the experimental alpha decay half life data for the known darmstadtium isotopes it also predicts that the undiscovered isotope ds which has a magic number of neutrons would have an alpha decay half life on the order of years exactly the same approach predicts a year alpha half life for the non magic ds isotope however predicted properties other than nuclear properties no properties of darmstadtium or its compounds have been measured this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that darmstadtium and its parents decays very quickly properties of darmstadtium metal remain unknown and only predictions are available chemical darmstadtium is the eighth member of the d series of transition metals and should be much like the platinum group metals calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue platinum thus implying that darmstadtium s basic properties will resemble those of the other group elements nickel palladium and platinum prediction of the probable chemical properties of darmstadtium has not received much attention recently darmstadtium should be a very noble metal the predicted standard reduction potential for the ds ds couple is v based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group elements the most stable oxidation states of darmstadtium are predicted to be the and states however the neutral state is predicted to be the most stable in aqueous solutions in comparison only palladium and platinum are known to show the maximum oxidation state in the group while the most stable states are and for both nickel and palladium it is further expected that the maximum oxidation states of elements from bohrium element to darmstadtium element may be stable in the gas phase but not in aqueous solution darmstadtium hexafluoride dsf is predicted to have very similar properties to its lighter homologue platinum hexafluoride ptf having very similar electronic structures and ionization potentials it is also expected to have the same octahedral molecular geometry as ptf other predicted darmstadtium compounds are darmstadtium carbide dsc and darmstadtium tetrachloride dscl both of which are expected to behave like their lighter homologues unlike platinum which preferentially forms a cyanide complex in its oxidation state pt cn darmstadtium is expected to preferentially remain in its neutral state and form ds cn instead forming a strong ds c bond with some multiple bond character physical and atomic darmstadtium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body centered cubic structure unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face centered cubic structure because it is expected to have different electron charge densities from them it should be a very heavy metal with a density of around g cm in comparison the densest known element that has had its density measured osmium has a density of only g cm the outer electron configuration of darmstadtium is calculated to be d s which obeys the aufbau principle and does not follow platinum s outer electron configuration of d s this is due to the relativistic stabilization of the s electron pair over the whole seventh period so that none of the elements from to are expected to have electron configurations violating the aufbau principle the atomic radius of darmstadtium is expected to be around pm experimental chemistry unambiguous determination of the chemical characteristics of darmstadtium has yet to have been established due to the short half lives of darmstadtium isotopes and a limited number of likely volatile compounds that could be studied on a very small scale one of the few darmstadtium compounds that are likely to be sufficiently volatile is darmstadtium hexafluoride dsf as its lighter

continuously to separate out the darmstadtium isotopes and have automated systems experiment on the gas phase and solution chemistry of darmstadtium as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements some of the separation techniques used for bohrium and hassium could be reused however the experimental chemistry of darmstadtium has not received as much attention as that of the heavier elements from copernicium to livermorium the more neutron rich darmstadtium isotopes are the most stable and are thus more promising for chemical studies however they can only be produced indirectly from the alpha decay of heavier elements and indirect synthesis methods are not as favourable for chemical studies as direct synthesis methods the more neutron rich isotopes ds and ds might be produced directly in the reaction between thorium and calcium but the yield was expected to be low following several unsuccessful attempts a single atom of ds was produced in this reaction in having a short half life and low yield in agreement with predictions though exact values have not yet been published furthermore ds was successfully synthesized using indirect methods as a granddaughter of fl and found to have a short half life of ms not long enough to perform chemical studies the only known darmstadtium isotope with a half life long enough for chemical research is ds which would have to be produced as the granddaughter of fl ,110
Roentgenium,Rg,roentgenium is a chemical element with the symbol rg and atomic number it is an extremely radioactive synthetic element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature

bi ni rg nthis reaction had previously been conducted at the joint institute for nuclear research in dubna then in the soviet union in but no atoms of rg had then been observed in the iupac iupap

have also been reported to have half lives over a second the remaining isotopes have half lives in the millisecond range predicted properties other than nuclear properties no properties of roentgenium

roentgenium is predicted to show stable and oxidation states with a less stable state the state is predicted to be the most stable roentgenium iii is expected to be of comparable reactivity to gold iii but should be more stable and form a larger variety of compounds gold also forms a somewhat stable state due to relativistic effects and it has been suggested roentgenium may do so as well nevertheless the electron affinity of roentgenium is expected to be around ev kcal mol significantly lower than gold s value of ev kcal mol so roentgenides may not be stable or even possible the d orbitals are destabilized by relativistic effects and spin orbit interactions near the end of the fourth transition metal series thus making the high oxidation state roentgenium v more stable than its lighter homologue gold v known only in gold pentafluoride au f as the d electrons participate in bonding to a greater extent the spin orbit interactions stabilize molecular roentgenium compounds with more bonding d electrons for example rgf is expected to be more stable than rgf which is expected to be more stable than rgf the stability of rgf is homologous to that of auf the silver analogue agf is unknown and is expected to be only marginally stable to decomposition to agf and f moreover rg f is expected to be stable to decomposition exactly analogous to the au f whereas ag f should be unstable to decomposition to ag f and f gold heptafluoride auf is known as a gold v difluorine complex auf f which is lower in energy than a true gold vii heptafluoride would be rgf is instead calculated to be more stable as a true roentgenium vii heptafluoride although it would be somewhat unstable its decomposition to rg f and f releasing a small amount of energy at room temperature roentgenium i is expected to be difficult to obtain gold readily forms the cyanide complex au cn which is used in its extraction from ore through the process of gold cyanidation roentgenium is expected to follow suit and form rg cn the probable chemistry of roentgenium has received more interest than that of the two previous elements meitnerium and darmstadtium as the valence s subshells of the group elements are expected to be relativistically contracted most strongly at roentgenium calculations on the molecular compound rgh show that relativistic effects double the strength of the roentgenium hydrogen bond even though spin orbit interactions also weaken it by ev kcal mol the compounds aux and rgx where x f cl br o au or rg were also studied rg is predicted to be the softest

gold all have an outer electron configuration n d ns for each of these elements the first excited state of their atoms has a configuration n d ns due to spin orbit coupling between the d electrons this state is split into a pair of energy levels for copper the difference in energy between the ground state and lowest excited state causes the metal to appear reddish for silver the energy gap widens and it becomes silvery however as the atomic number increases the excited levels are stabilized by relativistic effects and in gold the energy gap decreases again and it appears gold for roentgenium calculations indicate that the d s level is stabilized to such an extent that it becomes the ground state and the d s level becomes the first excited state the resulting energy difference between the new ground state and the first excited state is similar to that of silver and roentgenium is expected to be silvery in appearance the atomic radius of roentgenium is expected to be around

volatile element so much so that it is possibly a gas or a volatile liquid at standard temperature and pressure copernicium is calculated to have several properties that differ from its lighter homologues in group zinc cadmium and mercury due to relativistic effects it may give up its d electrons instead of its s ones and it may have more similarities to the noble gases such as radon rather than its group homologues calculations indicate that copernicium may show the oxidation state while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all it has also been predicted to be more difficult to oxidize copernicium from its neutral state than the other group elements predictions vary on whether solid copernicium would be a metal

using a gas filled recoil separator set up in and to synthesize three further atoms and confirm the decay data reported by the gsi team this reaction had also previously been tried in at the joint institute for nuclear research in dubna russia to aim for cn produced in the n channel but without success the iupac iupap joint working party jwp assessed the claim of copernicium s discovery by the gsi team in and in both cases they found that there was insufficient evidence to support their claim this was primarily related to the contradicting decay data for the known nuclide rutherfordium however between and the gsi team studied the reaction cm mg n hs and were able to confirm the decay data for hassium and rutherfordium it was found that the existing data on rutherfordium was for an isomer now designated rutherfordium m in may the jwp reported on the claims of discovery of element again and officially recognized the gsi team as the discoverers of element this decision was based on the confirmation of the decay properties of daughter nuclei as well as the confirmatory experiments at riken work had also been done at the joint institute for nuclear research in dubna russia from to synthesise the heavier isotope cn in the hot fusion reaction u ca n cn most observed atoms of cn decayed by spontaneous fission although an alpha decay branch to ds was detected while initial experiments aimed to assign the produced nuclide with its observed long half life of minutes based on its chemical behaviour this was found to be not mercury like as would have been expected copernicium being under mercury in the periodic table and indeed now it appears that the long lived activity might not have been from cn at all but its electron capture daughter rg instead with a shorter second half life associated with cn another possibility is assignment to a metastable isomeric state mcn while later cross bombardments in the pu ca and cm ca reactions succeeded in confirming the properties of cn and its parents fl and lv and played a major role in the acceptance of the discoveries of flerovium and livermorium elements and by the jwp in this work originated subsequent to

mostly ignored among scientists in the field who either called it element with the symbol of e or even simply after acknowledging the gsi team s discovery the iupac asked them to suggest a permanent name for element on july they proposed copernicium with the element symbol cp after nicolaus copernicus to honor an outstanding scientist who changed our view of the world during the standard six month discussion period among the scientific community about the naming it was pointed out that the symbol cp was previously associated with the name cassiopeium cassiopium now known as lutetium lu and the compound cyclopentadiene for this reason the iupac disallowed the use of cp as a future symbol prompting the gsi team to put forward the symbol cn as an alternative on february the th anniversary of copernicus birth iupac officially accepted the proposed name and symbol isotopes copernicium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements seven different isotopes have been reported with mass numbers and and one unconfirmed metastable isomer in cn has been reported most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay but some undergo spontaneous fission and copernicium may have an electron capture branch the isotope copernicium was instrumental in the confirmation of the discoveries of the elements flerovium and livermorium half lives all confirmed copernicium isotopes are extremely unstable and radioactive in general heavier isotopes are more stable than the lighter the most stable known isotope cn has a half life of seconds cn has a half life of seconds and the unconfirmed mcn and cn have half lives of about and seconds respectively other isotopes have half lives shorter than one second cn and cn both have half lives on the order of seconds and the other two isotopes have half lives slightly under one millisecond it is predicted that the heavy isotopes cn and cn may have half lives longer than a few decades for they are predicted to lie near the center of the theoretical island of stability and may have been produced in the r process and be detectable in cosmic rays though they would be about times as abundant as lead the lightest isotopes of copernicium have been synthesized by direct fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products except for cn which is not known to be a decay product while the heavier isotopes are only known to be produced by decay of heavier nuclei the heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is cn the three heavier isotopes cn cn and cn have only been observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers in american scientists at the university of california berkeley announced that they had succeeded in synthesizing three atoms of og these parent nuclei were reported to have successively emitted three alpha particles to form copernicium nuclei which were claimed to have undergone alpha decay emitting alpha particles with decay energy mev and half life ms but their claim was retracted in as it had been based on data fabricated by ninov this isotope was truly produced in by the same team the new data contradicted the previous fabricated data predicted properties very few properties of copernicium or its compounds have been measured this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that copernicium and its parents decays very quickly a few singular chemical properties have been measured as well as the boiling point but properties of the copernicium metal remain generally unknown and for the most part only predictions are available chemical copernicium is the tenth and last member of the d series and is the heaviest group element in the periodic table below zinc cadmium and mercury it is predicted to differ significantly from the lighter group elements the valence s subshells of the group elements and period elements are expected to be relativistically contracted most strongly at copernicium this and the closed shell configuration of copernicium result in it probably being a very noble metal a standard reduction potential of v is predicted for the cn cn couple copernicium s predicted first ionization energy of kj mol almost matches that of the noble gas xenon at kj mol copernicium s metallic bonds should also be very weak possibly making it extremely volatile like the noble gases and potentially making it gaseous at room temperature however it should be able to form metal metal bonds with copper palladium platinum silver and gold these bonds are predicted to be only about kj mol weaker than the analogous bonds with mercury in opposition to the earlier suggestion ab initio calculations at the high level of accuracy predicted that the chemistry of singly valent copernicium resembles that of mercury rather than that of the noble gases the latter result can be explained by the huge spin orbit interaction which significantly lowers the energy of the vacant p state of copernicium once copernicium is ionized its chemistry may present several differences from those of zinc cadmium and mercury due to the stabilization of s electronic orbitals and destabilization of d ones caused by relativistic effects cn is likely to have a rn f d s electronic configuration using the d orbitals before the s one unlike its homologues the fact that the d electrons participate more readily in chemical bonding means that once copernicium is ionized it may behave more like a transition metal than its lighter homologues especially in the possible oxidation state in aqueous solutions copernicium may form the and perhaps oxidation states the diatomic ion hg featuring mercury in the oxidation state is well known but the cn ion is predicted to be unstable or even non existent copernicium ii fluoride cnf should be more unstable than the analogous mercury compound mercury ii fluoride hgf and may even decompose spontaneously into its constituent elements as the most electronegative reactive element fluorine may be the only element able to oxidise copernicium even further to the and even oxidation states in cnf and cnf the latter may require matrix isolation conditions to be detected as in the disputed detection of hgf cnf should be more stable than cnf in polar solvents copernicium is predicted to preferentially form the cnf and cnf anions rather than the analogous neutral fluorides cnf and cnf respectively although the analogous bromide or iodide ions may be more stable towards hydrolysis in aqueous solution the anions cncl and cnbr should also be able to exist in aqueous solution the formation of thermodynamically stable copernicium ii and iv fluorides would be analogous to the chemistry of xenon analogous to mercury ii cyanide hg cn copernicium is expected to form a stable cyanide cn cn physical and atomic copernicium should be a dense metal with a density of g cm in the liquid state at k this is similar to the known density of mercury which is g cm solid copernicium at the same temperature should have a higher density of g cm this results from the effects of copernicium s higher atomic weight being cancelled out by its larger interatomic distances compared to mercury some calculations predicted copernicium to be a gas at room temperature due to its closed shell electron configuration which would make it the first gaseous metal in the periodic table a calculation agrees with these predictions on the role of relativistic effects suggesting that copernicium will be a volatile liquid bound by dispersion forces under standard conditions its melting point is estimated at k and its boiling point at k the latter in agreement with the experimentally estimated value of k the atomic radius of copernicium is expected to be around pm due to the relativistic stabilization of the s orbital and destabilization of the d orbital the cn and cn ions are predicted to give up d electrons instead of s electrons which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues in addition to the relativistic contraction and binding of the s subshell the d orbital is expected to be destabilized due to spin orbit coupling making it behave similarly to the s orbital in terms of size shape and energy predictions of the expected band structure of copernicium are varied calculations in expected that copernicium may be a semiconductor with a band gap of around ev crystallizing in the hexagonal close packed crystal structure however calculations in and suggested that copernicium should be a noble metal at standard conditions with a body centered cubic crystal structure it should hence have no band gap like mercury although the density of states at the fermi level is expected to be lower for copernicium than for mercury calculations then suggested that in fact copernicium has a large band gap of ev which should be similar to that of the noble gas radon predicted as ev and would make it an insulator bulk copernicium is predicted by these calculations to be bound mostly by dispersion forces like the noble gases like mercury radon and flerovium but not oganesson eka radon copernicium is calculated to have no electron affinity experimental atomic gas phase chemistry interest in copernicium s chemistry was sparked by predictions that it would have the largest relativistic effects in the whole of period and group and indeed among all known elements copernicium is expected to have the ground state electron configuration rn f d s and thus should belong to group of the periodic table according to the aufbau principle as such it should behave as the heavier homologue of mercury and form strong binary compounds with noble metals like gold experiments probing the reactivity of copernicium have focused on the adsorption of atoms of element onto a gold surface held at varying temperatures in order to calculate an adsorption enthalpy owing to relativistic stabilization of the s electrons copernicium shows radon like properties experiments were performed with the simultaneous formation of mercury and radon radioisotopes allowing a comparison of adsorption characteristics the first chemical experiments on copernicium were conducted using the u ca n cn reaction detection was by spontaneous fission of the claimed parent isotope with half life of minutes analysis of the data indicated that copernicium was more volatile than mercury and had noble gas properties however the confusion regarding the synthesis of copernicium has cast some doubt on these experimental results given this uncertainty between april may at the jinr a flnr psi team conducted experiments probing the synthesis of this isotope as a daughter in the nuclear reaction pu ca n fl the pu ca fusion reaction has a slightly larger cross section than the u ca reaction so that the best way to produce copernicium for chemical experimentation is as an overshoot product as the daughter of flerovium in this experiment two atoms of copernicium were unambiguously identified and the adsorption properties were interpret to show that copernicium is a more volatile homologue of mercury due to formation of a weak metal metal bond with gold this agrees with general indications from some relativistic calculations that copernicium is more or less homologous to mercury however it was pointed out in that this result may simply be due to strong dispersion interactions in april this experiment was repeated and a further three atoms of copernicium were positively identified the adsorption property was confirmed and indicated that copernicium has adsorption properties in agreement with being the heaviest member of group these experiments also allowed the first experimental estimation of copernicium s boiling point c so that it may be a gas at standard conditions because the lighter group elements often occur as chalcogenide ores experiments were conducted in to deposit copernicium atoms on a selenium surface to form copernicium selenide cnse reaction of copernicium atoms with trigonal selenium to form a selenide was observed with hadscn t se kj mol with the kinetic hindrance towards selenide formation being lower for copernicium than for mercury this was unexpected as the stability of the group selenides tends to decrease down the group from znse to hgse ,112
Nihonium,Nh,nihonium is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol nh and atomic number it is extremely radioactive its most stable known isotope nihonium has a half life of about seconds in the periodic table nihonium is a transactinide element in the p block it is a member of period and group boron group nihonium was first reported to have been created in by a russian american collaboration at the joint institute for nuclear research jinr in dubna russia and in by a team of japanese scientists at riken in wak japan the confirmation of their claims in the ensuing years involved independent teams of scientists working in the united states germany sweden and china as well as the original claimants in russia and japan in the iupac iupap joint working party recognised the element and assigned the priority of the discovery and naming rights for the element to riken the riken team suggested the name nihonium in which was approved in the same year the name comes from the common japanese name for japan nihon very little is known about nihonium as it has only been made in very small amounts that decay within seconds the anomalously long lives of some superheavy nuclides including some nihonium isotopes are explained by the island of stability theory experiments support the theory with the half lives of the confirmed nihonium isotopes increasing from milliseconds to seconds as neutrons are added and the island is approached nihonium has been calculated to have similar properties to its homologues boron aluminium gallium indium and thallium all but boron are post transition metals and nihonium is expected to be a post transition metal as well it should also show several major differences from them for example nihonium should be more stable in the oxidation state than the state like thallium but in the state nihonium should behave more like silver and astatine than thallium preliminary experiments in showed that elemental nihonium is not very volatile its chemistry remains largely unexplored introduction the heaviest atomic nuclei are created in nuclear reactions that combine two other nuclei of unequal size into one roughly the more unequal the two nuclei in terms of mass the greater the possibility that the two react the material made of the heavier nuclei is made into a target which is then bombarded by the beam of lighter nuclei two nuclei can only fuse into one if they approach each other closely enough normally nuclei all positively charged repel each other due to electrostatic repulsion the strong interaction can overcome this repulsion but only within a very short distance from a nucleus beam nuclei are thus greatly accelerated in order to make such repulsion insignificant compared to the velocity of the beam nucleus coming close alone is not enough for two nuclei to fuse when two nuclei approach each other they usually remain together for approximately seconds and then part ways not necessarily in the same composition as before the reaction rather than form a single nucleus if fusion does occur the temporary merger termed a compound nucleus is an excited state to lose its excitation energy and reach a more stable state a compound nucleus either fissions or ejects one or several neutrons which carry away the energy this occurs in approximately seconds after the initial collision the beam passes through the target and reaches the next chamber the separator if a new nucleus is produced it is carried with this beam in the separator the newly produced nucleus is separated from other nuclides that of the original beam and any other reaction products and transferred to a surface barrier detector which stops the nucleus the exact location of the upcoming impact on the detector is marked also marked are its energy and the time of the arrival the transfer takes about seconds in order to be detected the nucleus must survive this long the nucleus is recorded again once its decay is registered and the location the energy and the time of the decay are measured stability of a nucleus is provided by the strong interaction however its range is very short as nuclei become larger their influence on the outermost nucleons protons and neutrons weakens at the same time the nucleus is torn apart by electrostatic repulsion between protons as it has unlimited range nuclei of the heaviest elements are thus theoretically predicted and have so far been observed to primarily decay via decay modes that are caused by such repulsion alpha decay and spontaneous fission these modes are predominant for nuclei of superheavy elements alpha decays are registered by the emitted alpha particles and the decay products are easy to determine before the actual decay if such a decay or a series of consecutive decays produces a known nucleus the original product of a reaction can be determined arithmetically spontaneous fission however produces various nuclei as products so the original nuclide cannot be determined from its daughters the information available to physicists aiming to synthesize one of the heaviest elements is thus the information collected at the detectors location energy and time of arrival of a particle to the detector and those of its decay the physicists analyze this data and seek to conclude that it was indeed caused by a new element and could not have been caused by a different nuclide than the one claimed often provided data is insufficient for a conclusion that a new element was definitely created and there is no other explanation for the observed effects errors in interpreting data have been made history early indications the syntheses of elements to were conducted at the gsi helmholtz centre for heavy ion research in darmstadt germany from to these elements were made by cold fusion reactions in which targets made of thallium lead and bismuth which are around the stable configuration of protons are bombarded with heavy ions of period elements this creates fused nuclei with low excitation energies due to the stability of the targets nuclei significantly increasing the yield of superheavy elements cold fusion was pioneered by yuri oganessian and his team in at the joint institute for nuclear research jinr in dubna soviet union yields from cold fusion reactions were found to decrease significantly with increasing atomic number the resulting nuclei were severely neutron deficient and short lived the gsi team attempted to synthesise element via cold fusion in and bombarding bismuth with zinc both attempts were unsuccessful faced with this problem oganessian and his team at the jinr turned their renewed attention to the older hot fusion technique in which heavy actinide targets were bombarded with lighter ions calcium was suggested as an ideal projectile because it is very neutron rich for a light element combined with the already neutron rich actinides and would minimise the neutron deficiencies of the nuclides produced being doubly magic it would confer benefits in stability to the fused nuclei in collaboration with the team at the lawrence livermore national laboratory llnl in livermore california united states they made an attempt on element which was predicted to be a magic number closing a proton shell and more stable than element in the jinr llnl collaboration started their attempt on element bombarding a target of plutonium with ions of calcium pu ca n e ea single atom was observed which was thought to be the isotope the results were published in january despite numerous attempts to repeat this reaction an isotope with these decay properties has never again been found and the exact identity of this activity is unknown a paper by sigurd hofmann et al considered that the most likely explanation of the result is that two neutrons were emitted by the produced compound nucleus leading to and electron capture to while more neutrons were emitted in all other produced chains this would have been the first report of a decay chain from an isotope of element but it was not recognised at the time and the assignment is still uncertain a similar long lived activity observed by the jinr team in march in the pu ca reaction may be due to the electron capture daughter of this assignment is also tentative jinr llnl collaboration the now confirmed discovery of element was made in june when the jinr team repeated the first pu ca reaction from following this the jinr team used the same hot fusion technique to synthesise elements and in and respectively via the cm ca and cf ca reactions they then turned their attention to the missing odd numbered elements as the odd protons and possibly neutrons would hinder decay by spontaneous fission and result in longer decay chains the first report of element was in august when it was identified as an alpha decay product of element element had been produced by bombarding a target of americium with calcium projectiles the jinr llnl collaboration published its results in february am ca n am ca n four further alpha decays were observed ending with the spontaneous fission of isotopes of element dubnium riken while the jinr llnl collaboration had been studying fusion reactions with ca a team of japanese scientists at the riken nishina center for accelerator based science in wak japan led by k suke morita had been studying cold fusion reactions morita had previously studied the synthesis of superheavy elements at the jinr before starting his own team at riken in his team confirmed the gsi s discoveries of elements and they then made a new attempt on element using the same bi zn reaction that the gsi had attempted unsuccessfully in despite the much lower yield expected than for the jinr s hot fusion technique with calcium the riken team chose to use cold fusion as the synthesised isotopes would alpha decay to known daughter nuclides and make the discovery much more certain and would not require the use of radioactive targets in particular the isotope expected to be produced in this reaction would decay to the known bh which had been synthesised in by a team at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory lbnl in berkeley the bombardment of bi with zn at riken began in september the team detected a single atom of in july and published their results that september bi zn nthe riken team observed four alpha decays from creating a decay chain passing through rg mt and bh before terminating with the spontaneous fission of db the decay data they observed for the alpha decay of bh matched the data lending support for their claim spontaneous fission of its daughter db had not been previously known the american team had observed only alpha decay from this nuclide road to confirmation when the discovery of a new element is claimed the joint working party jwp of the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac and the international union of pure and applied physics iupap assembles to examine the claims according to their criteria for the discovery of a new element and decides scientific priority and naming rights for the elements according to the jwp criteria a discovery must demonstrate that the element has an atomic number different from all previously observed values it should also preferably be repeated by other laboratories although this requirement has been waived where the data is of very high quality such a demonstration must establish properties either physical or chemical of the new element and establish that they are those of a previously unknown element the main techniques used to demonstrate atomic number are cross reactions creating claimed nuclides as parents or daughters of other nuclides produced by a different reaction and anchoring decay chains to known daughter nuclides for the jwp priority in confirmation takes precedence over the date of the original claim both teams set out to confirm their results by these methods in june and again in december the jinr llnl collaboration strengthened their claim for the discovery of element by conducting chemical experiments on db the final decay product of this was valuable as none of the nuclides in this decay chain were previously known so that their claim was not supported by any previous experimental data and chemical experimentation would strengthen the case for their claim since the chemistry of dubnium is known db was successfully identified by extracting the final decay products measuring spontaneous fission sf activities and using chemical identification techniques to confirm that they behave like a group element dubnium is known to be in group both the half life and decay mode were confirmed for the proposed db which lends support to the assignment of the parent and daughter nuclei to elements and respectively further experiments at the jinr in confirmed the observed decay data in november and december the riken team studied the tl zn reaction aiming the zinc beam onto a thallium rather than a bismuth target in an effort to directly produce rg in a cross bombardment as it is the immediate daughter of the reaction was unsuccessful as the thallium target was physically weak compared to the more commonly used lead and bismuth targets and it deteriorated significantly and became non uniform in thickness the reasons for this weakness are unknown given that thallium has a higher melting point than bismuth the riken team then repeated the original bi zn reaction and produced a second atom of in april with a decay chain that again terminated with the spontaneous fission of db the decay data were slightly different from those of the first chain this could have been because an alpha particle escaped from the detector without depositing its full energy or because some of the intermediate decay products were formed in metastable isomeric states in a team at the heavy ion research facility in lanzhou china investigated the am mg reaction producing four atoms of bh all four chains started with an alpha decay to db three chains ended there with spontaneous fission as in the chains observed at riken while the remaining one continued via another alpha decay to lr as in the bh chains observed at lbnl in june the jinr llnl collaboration claimed to have synthesised a new isotope of element directly by bombarding a neptunium target with accelerated calcium nuclei np ca ntwo atoms of were detected the aim of this experiment had been to synthesise the isotopes and that would fill in the gap between isotopes produced via hot fusion and and cold fusion after five alpha decays these nuclides would reach known isotopes of lawrencium assuming that the decay chains were not terminated prematurely by spontaneous fission the first decay chain ended in fission after four alpha decays presumably originating from db or its electron capture daughter rf spontaneous fission was not observed in the second chain even after four alpha decays a fifth alpha decay in each chain could have been missed since db can theoretically undergo alpha decay in which case the first decay chain would have ended at the known lr or no and the second might have continued to the known long lived md which has a half life of days longer than the duration of the experiment this would explain the lack of a spontaneous fission event in this chain in the absence of direct detection of the long lived alpha decays these interpretations remain unconfirmed and there is still no known link between any superheavy nuclides produced by hot fusion and the well known main body of the chart of nuclides the jwp published its report on elements and in it recognised the jinr llnl collaboration as having discovered elements and but did not accept either team s claim to element and did not accept the jinr llnl claims to elements and the jinr llnl claim to elements and had been founded on chemical identification of their daughter dubnium but the jwp objected that current theory could not distinguish between superheavy group and group elements by their chemical properties with enough confidence to allow this assignment the decay properties of all the nuclei in the decay chain of element had not been previously characterised before the jinr experiments a situation which the jwp generally considers troublesome but not necessarily exclusive and with the small number of atoms produced with neither known daughters nor cross reactions the jwp considered that their criteria had not been fulfilled the jwp did not accept the riken team s claim either due to inconsistencies in the decay data the small number of atoms of element produced and the lack of unambiguous anchors to known isotopes in early the riken team synthesised the decay product bh directly in the cm na reaction to establish its link with as a cross bombardment they also established the branched decay of db which sometimes underwent spontaneous fission and sometimes underwent the previously known alpha decay to lr in late the jinr llnl collaboration studied the bk ca reaction in an effort to produce element which would decay to elements and and bolster their claims in a cross reaction they were now joined by scientists from oak ridge national laboratory ornl and vanderbilt university both in tennessee united states who helped procure the rare and highly radioactive berkelium target necessary to complete the jinr s calcium campaign to synthesise the heaviest elements on the periodic table two isotopes of element were synthesised decaying to element and then element bk ca n bk ca n the new isotopes and produced did not overlap with the previously claimed and so this reaction could not be used as a cross bombardment to confirm the or claims in march the riken team again attempted to synthesise rg directly through the tl zn reaction with upgraded equipment they failed again and abandoned this cross bombardment route after more days of irradiation of bismuth with zinc projectiles riken produced and identified another atom in august although electricity prices had soared since the t hoku earthquake and tsunami and riken had ordered the shutdown of the accelerator programs to save money morita s team was permitted to continue with one experiment and they chose their attempt to confirm their synthesis of element in this case a series of six alpha decays was observed leading to an isotope of mendelevium rg mt bh db lr md this decay chain differed from the previous observations at riken mainly in the decay mode of db which was previously observed to undergo spontaneous fission but in this case instead alpha decayed the alpha decay of db to lr is well known the team calculated the probability of accidental coincidence to be or totally negligible the resulting md atom then underwent electron capture to fm which underwent the seventh alpha decay in the chain to the long lived cf which has a half life of around thirteen years the bk ca experiment was repeated at the jinr in and with consistent results and again at the gsi in in august a team of researchers at lund university in lund sweden and at the gsi announced that they had repeated the am ca experiment confirming the findings of the jinr llnl collaboration the same year the experiment had been repeated at the jinr now also creating the isotope that could serve as a cross bombardment for confirming their discovery of the element isotope as well as its daughter as part of its decay chain confirmation of and its daughters was published by the team at the lbnl in approval of discoveries in december the conclusions of a new jwp report were published by iupac in a press release in which element was awarded to riken elements and were awarded to the collaborations involving the jinr a joint announcement by iupac and iupap had been scheduled to coincide with the publication of the jwp reports but iupac alone decided on an early release because the news of riken being awarded credit for element had been leaked to japanese newspapers for the first time in history a team of asian physicists would name a new element the jinr considered the awarding of element to riken unexpected citing their own production of elements and and pointing to the precedents of elements and where iupac had awarded joint credit to the jinr and lbnl they stated that they respected iupac s decision but reserved determination of their position for the official publication of the jwp reports the full jwp reports were published on january the jwp recognised the discovery of element assigning priority to riken they noted that while the individual decay energies of each nuclide in the decay chain of were inconsistent their sum was now confirmed to be consistent strongly suggesting that the initial and final states in and its daughter db were the same for all three events the decay of db to lr and md was previously known firmly anchoring the decay chain of to known regions of the chart of nuclides the jwp considered that the jinr llnl collaborations of and producing element as the daughter of element did not meet the discovery criteria as they had not convincingly determined the atomic numbers of their nuclides through cross bombardments which were considered necessary since their decay chains were not anchored to previously known nuclides they also considered that the previous jwp s concerns over their chemical identification of the dubnium daughter had not been adequately addressed the jwp recognised the jinr llnl ornl vanderbilt collaboration of as having discovered elements and and accepted that element had been produced as their daughter but did not give this work shared credit after the publication of the jwp reports sergey dimitriev the lab director of the flerov lab at the jinr where the discoveries were made remarked that he was happy with iupac s decision mentioning the time riken spent on their experiment and their good relations with morita who had learnt the basics of synthesising superheavy elements at the jinr the sum argument advanced by the jwp in the approval of the discovery of element was later criticised in a may study from lund university and the gsi as it is only valid if no gamma decay or internal conversion takes place along the decay chain which is not likely for odd nuclei and the uncertainty of the alpha decay energies measured in the decay chain was not small enough to rule out this possibility if this is the case similarity in lifetimes of intermediate daughters becomes a meaningless argument as different isomers of the same nuclide can have different half lives for example the ground state of ta has a half life of hours but an excited state mta has never been observed to decay this study found reason to doubt and criticise the iupac approval of the discoveries of elements and but the data from riken for element was found to be congruent and the data from the jinr team for elements and to probably be so thus endorsing the iupac approval of the discovery of element two members of the jinr team published a journal article rebutting these criticisms against the congruence of their data on elements and in june naming using mendeleev s nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements nihonium would be known as eka thallium in iupac published recommendations according to which the element was to be called ununtrium with the corresponding symbol of uut a systematic element name as a placeholder until the discovery of the element is confirmed and a name is decided on the recommendations were widely used in the chemical community on all levels from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks but were mostly ignored among scientists in the field who called it element with the symbol of e or even simply before the jwp recognition of their priority the japanese team had unofficially suggested various names japonium after their home country nishinanium after japanese physicist yoshio nishina the founding father of modern physics research in japan and rikenium after the institute after the recognition the riken team gathered in february to decide on a name morita expressed his desire for the name to honour the fact that element had been discovered in japan japonium was considered making the connection to japan easy to identify for non japanese but it was rejected as jap is considered an ethnic slur the name nihonium was chosen after an hour of deliberation it comes from nihon one of the two japanese pronunciations for the name of japan the discoverers also intended to reference the support of their research by the japanese people riken being almost entirely government funded recover lost pride and trust in science among those who were affected by the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster and honour japanese chemist masataka ogawa s discovery of rhenium which he named nipponium with symbol np after the other japanese pronunciation of japan s name as ogawa s claim had not been accepted the name nipponium could not be reused for a new element and its symbol np had since been used for neptunium in march morita proposed the name nihonium to iupac with the symbol nh the naming realised what had been a national dream in japanese science ever since ogawa s claim the former president of iupap cecilia jarlskog complained at the nobel symposium on superheavy elements in b ckaskog castle sweden in june about the lack of openness involved in the process of approving new elements and stated that she believed that the jwp s work was flawed and should be redone by a new jwp a survey of physicists determined that many felt that the lund gsi criticisms of the jwp report were well founded but that the conclusions would hold up if the work was redone and the new president bruce mckellar ruled that the proposed names should be released in a joint iupap iupac press release thus iupac and iupap publicised the proposal of nihonium that june and set a five month term to collect comments after which the name would be formally established at a conference the name was officially approved in november the naming ceremony for the new element was held in tokyo japan in march with naruhito then the crown prince of japan in attendance isotopes nihonium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes several radioactive isotopes have been synthesised in the laboratory either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements eight different isotopes of nihonium have been reported with atomic masses and nh and nh are unconfirmed they all decay through alpha decay to isotopes of roentgenium there have been indications that nihonium can also decay by electron capture to copernicium stability and half lives the stability of nuclei quickly decreases with the increase in atomic number after curium element whose half life is over ten thousand times longer than that of any subsequent element all isotopes with an atomic number above undergo radioactive decay with half lives of less than hours this is because of the ever increasing coulomb repulsion of protons so that the strong nuclear force cannot hold the nucleus together against spontaneous fission for long calculations suggest that in the absence of other stabilising factors elements with more than protons should not exist researchers in the s suggested that the closed nuclear shells around protons and neutrons should counteract this instability and create an island of stability containing nuclides with half lives reaching thousands or millions of years the existence of the island is still unproven but the existence of the superheavy elements including nihonium confirms that the stabilising effect is real and in general the known superheavy nuclides become longer lived as they approach the predicted location of the island all nihonium isotopes are unstable and radioactive the heavier nihonium isotopes are more stable than the lighter ones as they are closer to the centre of the island the most stable known nihonium isotope nh is also the heaviest it has a half life of seconds the isotope nh as well as the unconfirmed nh and nh have also been reported to have half lives of over a second the isotopes nh and nh have half lives of and seconds respectively the remaining two isotopes have half lives between and milliseconds nh has a half life of milliseconds and nh the lightest known nihonium isotope is also the shortest lived with a half life of milliseconds this rapid increase in the half lives near the closed neutron shell at n is seen in roentgenium copernicium and nihonium elements through where each extra neutron so far multiplies the half life by a factor of to predicted properties very few properties of nihonium or its compounds have been measured this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact it decays very quickly properties of nihonium mostly remain unknown and only predictions are available physical and atomic nihonium is the first member of the p series of elements and the heaviest group element on the periodic table below boron aluminium gallium indium and thallium all the group elements except boron are metals and nihonium is expected to follow suit nihonium is predicted to show many differences from its lighter homologues the major reason for this is the spin orbit so interaction which is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move much faster than in lighter atoms at velocities close to the speed of light in relation to nihonium atoms it lowers the s and the p electron energy levels stabilising those electrons but two of the p electron energy levels are stabilised more than the other four the stabilisation of the s electrons is called the inert pair effect and the separation of the p subshell into the more and less stabilised parts is called subshell splitting computational chemists see the split as a change of the second azimuthal quantum number l from to and for the more and less stabilised parts of the p subshell respectively for theoretical purposes the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the p subshell split as s p the first ionisation energy of nihonium is expected to be ev the highest among the metals of group similar subshell splitting should exist for the d electron levels with four being d and six being d both these levels are raised to be close in energy to the s ones high enough to possibly be chemically active this would allow for the possibility of exotic nihonium compounds without lighter group analogues periodic trends would predict nihonium to have an atomic radius larger than that of thallium due to it being one period further down the periodic table but calculations suggest nihonium has an atomic radius of about pm the same as that of thallium due to the relativistic stabilisation and contraction of its s and p orbitals thus nihonium is expected to be much denser than thallium with a predicted density of about to g cm compared to thallium s g cm since nihonium atoms are heavier than thallium atoms but have the same volume bulk nihonium is expected to have a hexagonal close packed crystal structure like thallium the melting and boiling points of nihonium have been predicted to be c and c respectively exceeding the values for gallium indium and thallium following periodic trends nihonium should have a bulk modulus of gpa about half that of thallium gpa chemical the chemistry of nihonium is expected to be very different from that of thallium this difference stems from the spin orbit splitting of the p shell which results in nihonium being between two relatively inert closed shell elements copernicium and flerovium an unprecedented situation in the periodic table nihonium is expected to be less reactive than thallium because of the greater stabilisation and resultant chemical inactivity of the s subshell in nihonium compared to the s subshell in thallium the standard electrode potential for the nh nh couple is predicted to be v nihonium should be a rather noble metal the metallic group elements are typically found in two oxidation states and the former results from the involvement of only the single p electron in bonding and the latter results in the involvement of all three valence electrons two in the s subshell and one in the p subshell going down the group bond energies decrease and the state becomes less stable as the energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining the state is not always enough to outweigh the energy needed to involve the s electrons hence for aluminium and gallium is the most stable state but gains importance for indium and by thallium it becomes more stable than the state nihonium is expected to continue this trend and have as its most stable oxidation state the simplest possible nihonium compound is the monohydride nhh the bonding is provided by the p electron of nihonium and the s electron of hydrogen the so interaction causes the binding energy of nihonium monohydride to be reduced by about ev and the nihonium hydrogen bond length to decrease as the bonding p orbital is relativistically contracted this is unique among the p element monohydrides all the others have relativistic expansion of the bond length instead of contraction another effect of the so interaction is that the nh h bond is expected to have significant pi bonding character side on orbital overlap unlike the almost pure sigma bonding head on orbital overlap in thallium monohydride tlh the analogous monofluoride nhf should also exist nihonium i is predicted to be more similar to silver i than thallium i the nh ion is expected to more willingly bind anions so that nhcl should be quite soluble in excess hydrochloric acid or ammonia tlcl is not in contrast to tl which forms the strongly basic hydroxide tloh in solution the nh cation should instead hydrolyse all the way to the amphoteric oxide nh o which would be soluble in aqueous ammonia and weakly soluble in water the adsorption behaviour of nihonium on gold surfaces in thermochromatographical experiments is expected to be closer to that of astatine than that of thallium the destabilisation of the p subshell effectively leads to a valence shell closing at the s p configuration rather than the expected s p configuration with its stable octet as such nihonium like astatine can be considered to be one p electron short of a closed valence shell hence even though nihonium is in group it has several properties similar to the group elements tennessine in group has some group like properties as it has three valence electrons outside the s p closed shell nihonium is expected to be able to gain an electron to attain this closed shell configuration forming the oxidation state like the halogens fluorine chlorine bromine iodine and astatine this state should be more stable than it is for thallium as the so splitting of the p subshell is greater than that for the p subshell nihonium should be the most electronegative of the metallic group elements even more electronegative than tennessine the period congener of the halogens in the compound nhts the negative charge is expected to be on the nihonium atom rather than the tennessine atom the oxidation should be more stable for nihonium than for tennessine the electron affinity of nihonium is calculated to be around ev higher than thallium s at ev tennessine s is expected to be ev the lowest in its group it is theoretically predicted that nihonium should have an enthalpy of sublimation around kj mol and an enthalpy of adsorption on a gold surface around kj mol significant d involvement is expected in the nh au bond although it is expected to be more unstable than the tl au bond and entirely due to magnetic interactions this raises the possibility of some transition metal character for nihonium on the basis of the small energy gap between the d and s electrons the higher oxidation states and have been suggested for nihonium some simple compounds with nihonium in the oxidation state would be the trihydride nhh trifluoride nhf and trichloride nhcl these molecules are predicted to be t shaped and not trigonal planar as their boron analogues are this is due to the influence of the d electrons on the bonding the heavier nihonium tribromide nhbr and triiodide nhi are trigonal planar due to the increased steric repulsion between the peripheral atoms accordingly they do not show significant d involvement in their bonding though the large s p energy gap means that they show reduced sp hybridisation compared to their boron analogues the bonding in the lighter nhx molecules can be considered as that of a linear nhx species similar to hgf or auf with an additional nh x bond involving the p orbital of nihonium perpendicular to the other two ligands these compounds are all expected to be highly unstable towards the loss of an x molecule and reduction to nihonium i nhx nhx x nihonium thus continues the trend down group of reduced stability of the oxidation state as all five of these compounds have lower reaction energies than the unknown thallium iii iodide the state is stabilised for thallium in anionic complexes such as tli and the presence of a possible vacant coordination site on the lighter t shaped nihonium trihalides is expected to allow a similar stabilisation of nhf and perhaps nhcl the oxidation state is unknown for all lighter group elements calculations predict that nihonium pentahydride nhh and pentafluoride nhf should have a square pyramidal molecular geometry but also that both would be highly thermodynamically unstable to loss of an x molecule and reduction to nihonium iii again some stabilisation is expected for anionic complexes such as nhf the structures of the nihonium trifluoride and pentafluoride molecules are the same as those for chlorine trifluoride and pentafluoride experimental chemistry the chemical characteristics of nihonium have yet to be determined unambiguously the isotopes nh nh and nh have half lives long enough for chemical investigation from to some preliminary chemical experiments were performed at the jinr to determine the volatility of nihonium the isotope nh was investigated made as the daughter of mc produced in the am ca reaction the nihonium atoms were synthesised in a recoil chamber and then carried along polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe capillaries at c by a carrier gas to the gold covered detectors about ten to twenty atoms of nh were produced but none of these atoms were registered by the detectors suggesting either that nihonium was similar in volatility to the noble gases and thus diffused away too quickly to be detected or more plausibly that pure nihonium was not very volatile and thus could not efficiently pass through the ptfe capillaries formation of the hydroxide nhoh should ease the transport as nihonium hydroxide is expected to be more volatile than elemental nihonium and this reaction could be facilitated by adding more water vapour into the carrier gas it seems likely that this formation is not kinetically favoured so the longer lived isotopes nh and nh were considered more desirable for future experiments a experiment at the jinr producing nh and nh via the am ca reaction as the daughters of mc and mc avoided this problem by removing the quartz surface using only ptfe no nihonium atoms were observed after chemical separation implying an unexpectedly large retention of nihonium atoms on ptfe surfaces this experimental result for the interaction limit of nihonium atoms with a ptfe surface hptfeads nh kj mol disagrees significantly with previous theory which expected a lower value of kj mol this suggests that the nihonium species involved in the previous experiment was likely not elemental nihonium but rather nihonium hydroxide and that high temperature techniques such as vacuum chromatography would be necessary to further probe the behaviour of elemental nihonium bromine saturated with boron tribromide has been suggested as a carrier gas for experiments on nihonium chemistry this oxidises nihonium s lighter congener thallium to thallium iii providing an avenue to investigate the oxidation states of nihonium similar to earlier experiments done on the bromides of group elements including the superheavy dubnium ,113
Flevorium,Fl,flerovium is a superheavy chemical element with symbol fl and atomic number it is an extremely radioactive synthetic element it is named after the flerov laboratory of nuclear reactions of the joint institute for nuclear research in dubna russia where the element was discovered in the lab s name in turn honours russian physicist georgy flyorov in cyrillic hence the transliteration of yo to e iupac adopted the name on may the name and symbol had previously been proposed for element nobelium but was not accepted by iupac at that time it is a transactinide in the p block of the periodic table it is in period the heaviest known member of the carbon group and the last element whose chemistry has been investigated initial chemical studies in indicated that flerovium was unexpectedly volatile for a group element in preliminary results it even seemed to exhibit properties similar to noble gases more recent results show that flerovium s reaction with gold is similar to that of copernicium showing it is very volatile and may even be gaseous at standard temperature and pressure that it would show metallic properties consistent with being the heavier homologue of lead and that it would be the least reactive metal in group whether flerovium behaves more like a metal or a noble gas is still unresolved as of it might also be a semiconductor about flerovium atoms have been seen were synthesized directly the rest from radioactive decay of heavier elements all these flerovium atoms have been shown to have mass number the stablest known isotope fl has a half life of seconds but the unconfirmed fl may have a longer half life of seconds this would be one of the longest half lives of any nuclide in these farthest reaches of the periodic table flerovium is predicted to be near the centre of the theorized island of stability and it is expected that heavier flerovium isotopes especially the possibly magic fl may have even longer half lives introduction the heaviest atomic nuclei are created in nuclear reactions that combine two other nuclei of unequal size into one roughly the more unequal the two nuclei in terms of mass the greater the possibility that the two react the material made of the heavier nuclei is made into a target which is then bombarded by the beam of lighter nuclei two nuclei can only fuse into one if they approach each other closely enough normally nuclei all positively charged repel each other due to electrostatic repulsion the strong interaction can overcome this repulsion but only within a very short distance from a nucleus beam nuclei are thus greatly accelerated in order to make such repulsion insignificant compared to the velocity of the beam nucleus coming close alone is not enough for two nuclei to fuse when two nuclei approach each other they usually remain together for approximately seconds and then part ways not necessarily in the same composition as before the reaction rather than form a single nucleus if fusion does occur the temporary merger termed a compound nucleus is an excited state to lose its excitation energy and reach a more stable state a compound nucleus either fissions or ejects one or several neutrons which carry away the energy this occurs in approximately seconds after the initial collision the beam passes through the target and reaches the next chamber the separator if a new nucleus is produced it is carried with this beam in the separator the newly produced nucleus is separated from other nuclides that of the original beam and any other reaction products and transferred to a surface barrier detector which stops the nucleus the exact location of the upcoming impact on the detector is marked also marked are its energy and the time of the arrival the transfer takes about seconds in order to be detected the nucleus must survive this long the nucleus is recorded again once its decay is registered and the location the energy and the time of the decay are measured stability of a nucleus is provided by the strong interaction however its range is very short as nuclei become larger their influence on the outermost nucleons protons and neutrons weakens at the same time the nucleus is torn apart by electrostatic repulsion between protons as it has unlimited range nuclei of the heaviest elements are thus theoretically predicted and have so far been observed to primarily decay via decay modes that are caused by such repulsion alpha decay and spontaneous fission these modes are predominant for nuclei of superheavy elements alpha decays are registered by the emitted alpha particles and the decay products are easy to determine before the actual decay if such a decay or a series of consecutive decays produces a known nucleus the original product of a reaction can be determined arithmetically spontaneous fission however produces various nuclei as products so the original nuclide cannot be determined from its daughters the information available to physicists aiming to synthesize one of the heaviest elements is thus the information collected at the detectors location energy and time of arrival of a particle to the detector and those of its decay the physicists analyze this data and seek to conclude that it was indeed caused by a new element and could not have been caused by a different nuclide than the one claimed often provided data is insufficient for a conclusion that a new element was definitely created and there is no other explanation for the observed effects errors in interpreting data have been made history pre discovery in the late s to early s the early days of making heavier and heavier transuranic elements it was predicted that since such elements did not occur naturally they would have shorter and shorter spontaneous fission half lives until they stopped existing altogether around element now called hassium initial work in synthesizing the heavier actinides seemed to confirm this but the nuclear shell model introduced in and extensively developed in the late s by william myers and w adys aw wi tecki stated that protons and neutrons form shells within a nucleus analogous to electron shells noble gases are unreactive due to a full electron shell similarly it was theorized that elements with full nuclear shells those having magic numbers of protons or neutrons would be stabilized against decay a doubly magic isotope with magic numbers of both protons and neutrons would be especially stabilized heiner meldner calculated in that the next doubly magic isotope after pb was fl with protons and neutrons which would be the centre of an island of stability this island of stability supposedly from copernicium z to oganesson z would come after a long sea of instability from mendelevium z to roentgenium z and the flerovium isotopes in it were speculated in to have half lives over years these early predictions fascinated researchers and led to the first attempt to make flerovium in with the reaction cm ar xn no flerovium atoms were detected this was thought to be because the compound nucleus fl only has neutrons instead of the supposed magic and this would have significant impact on the reaction cross section yield and half lives of nuclei produced it was then more years before flerovium was first made later work suggests the islands of stability around hassium and flerovium occur because these nuclei are respectively deformed and oblate which make them resistant to spontaneous fission and that the true island of stability for spherical nuclei occurs at around unbibium protons neutrons discovery flerovium was first made in december by a team of scientists at joint institute for nuclear research jinr dubna russia led by yuri oganessian who bombarded a target of plutonium with accelerated nuclei of calcium pu ca fl fl nthis reaction had been tried before without success for this attempt jinr had upgraded all of its equipment to detect and separate the produced atoms better and bombard the target more intensely one atom of flerovium alpha decaying with lifetime s was detected the decay energy measured was mev giving an expected half life of s this observation was assigned to fl and was published in january the experiment was later repeated but an isotope with these decay properties was never observed again so the exact identity of this activity is unknown it may have been due to the isomer mfl but because the presence of a whole series of longer lived isomers in its decay chain would be rather doubtful the most likely assignment of this chain is to the n channel leading to fl and electron capture to nh which fits well with the systematics and trends of flerovium isotopes and is consistent with the low beam energy chosen for that experiment though further confirmation would be desirable via synthesis of lv in a cm ca n reaction which would alpha decay to fl the riken team reported possible synthesis of isotopes lv and fl in in a cm ca n reaction but the alpha decay of lv was missed alpha decay of fl to cn was observed instead of electron capture to nh and the assignment to lv instead of lv and decay to an isomer of cn was not certain glenn t seaborg a scientist at lawrence berkeley national laboratory who had been involved in work to make such superheavy elements had said in december that one of his longest lasting and most cherished dreams was to see one of these magic elements he was told of the synthesis of flerovium by his colleague albert ghiorso soon after its publication in ghiorso later recalled i wanted glenn to know so i went to his bedside and told him i thought i saw a gleam in his eye but the next day when i went to visit him he didn t remember seeing me as a scientist he had died when he had that stroke seaborg died two months later on february isotopes in march the same team replaced the pu target with pu to make other flerovium isotopes here two atoms of flerovium were produced alpha decaying with half life s they were assigned as fl this activity has not been seen again either and it is unclear what nucleus was produced it is possible that it was the isomer mfl or from electron capture by fl leading to nh and rg the now confirmed discovery of flerovium was made in june when the dubna team repeated the first reaction from this time two atoms of flerovium were produced they alpha decayed with half life s different from the result this activity was initially assigned to fl in error due to the confusion regarding the previous observations that were assumed to come from fl further work in december finally allowed a positive reassignment of the june atoms to fl in may the joint working party jwp of iupac published a report on the discovery of copernicium in which they acknowledged discovery of the isotope cn this implied the discovery of flerovium from the acknowledgement of the data for the synthesis of fl and lv which decay to cn the discovery of flerovium and was confirmed in january at berkeley this was followed by confirmation of flerovium and in july at gesellschaft f r schwerionenforschung gsi in germany in iupac evaluated the dubna team s experiments they found the early data inconclusive but accepted the results of as flerovium and the element was officially recognized as having been discovered while the method of chemical characterization of a daughter was successful for flerovium and livermorium and the simpler structure of even even nuclei made confirmation of oganesson z straightforward there have been difficulties in establishing the congruence of decay chains from isotopes with odd protons odd neutrons or both to get around this problem with hot fusion the decay chains from which terminate in spontaneous fission instead of connecting to known nuclei as cold fusion allows experiments were done in dubna in to produce lighter isotopes of flerovium by reaction of ca with pu and pu particularly fl fl and fl the last had previously been characterized in the pu ca n fl reaction at lawrence berkeley national laboratory in fl was more clearly characterized while the new isotope fl was found to undergo immediate spontaneous fission instead of alpha decay to known nuclides around the n shell closure and fl was not found this lightest isotope may yet conceivably be produced in the cold fusion reaction pb ge n fl which the team at riken in japan has considered investigating this reaction is expected to have a higher cross section of fb than the world record low of fb for bi zn n nh the reaction which riken used for the official discovery of element nihonium the dubna team repeated their investigation of the pu ca reaction in observing three new consistent decay chains of fl another decay chain from this nuclide that may pass through some isomeric states in its daughters a chain that could be assigned to fl likely from pu impurities in the target and some spontaneous fissions of which some could be from fl though other interpretations including side reactions involving evaporation of charged particles are also possible naming per mendeleev s nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements flerovium is sometimes called eka lead in iupac published recommendations according to which the element was to be called ununquadium symbol uuq a systematic element name as a placeholder until the discovery of the element is confirmed and a permanent name is decided on most scientists in the field called it element with the symbol of e or per iupac recommendations the discoverer s of a new element has the right to suggest a name after iupac recognized the discovery of flerovium and livermorium on june iupac asked the discovery team at jinr to suggest permanent names for the two elements the dubna team chose the name flerovium symbol fl after russia s flerov laboratory of nuclear reactions flnr named after soviet physicist georgy flyorov also spelled flerov earlier reports claim the element name was directly proposed to honour flyorov in accordance with the proposal received from the discoverers iupac officially named flerovium after flerov laboratory of nuclear reactions not after flyorov himself flyorov is known for writing to joseph stalin in april and pointing out the silence in scientific journals in the field of nuclear fission in the united states great britain and germany flyorov deduced that this research must have become classified information in those countries flyorov s work and urgings led to the development of the ussr s own atomic bomb project flyorov is also known for the discovery of spontaneous fission with konstantin petrzhak the naming ceremony for flerovium and livermorium was held on october in moscow in a interview with oganessian the host in preparation to ask a question said you said you had dreamed to name an element after your teacher georgy flyorov without letting the host finish oganessian repeatedly said i did predicted properties very few properties of flerovium or its compounds have been measured due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that it decays very quickly a few singular properties have been measured but for the most part properties of flerovium remain unknown and only predictions are available nuclear stability and isotopes the basis of the chemical periodicity in the periodic table is the electron shell closure at each noble gas atomic numbers and as any further electrons must enter a new shell with higher energy closed shell electron configurations are markedly more stable hence the inertness of noble gases protons and neutrons are also known to form closed nuclear shells so the same happens at nucleon shell closures which happen at specific nucleon numbers often dubbed magic numbers the known magic numbers are and for protons and neutrons also for neutrons nuclei with magic proton and neutron numbers such as helium oxygen calcium and lead are doubly magic and are very stable this stability is very important for superheavy elements with no stabilization half lives would be expected by exponential extrapolation to be nanoseconds at darmstadtium element because the ever increasing electrostatic repulsion between protons overcomes the limited range strong nuclear force that holds nuclei together the next closed nucleon shells magic numbers are thought to denote the centre of the long sought island of stability where half lives to alpha decay and spontaneous fission lengthen again initially by analogy with neutron magic number the next proton shell was also expected at element too far beyond the synthesis capabilities of the mid th century to get much theoretical attention in new values for the potential and spin orbit interaction in this region of the periodic table contradicted this and predicted that the next proton shell would instead be at element and that nuclei in this region would be relatively stable against spontaneous fission the expected closed neutron shells in this region were at neutron number or making fl and fl candidates for being doubly magic estimates predicted a half life of around year for fl which was expected to be near an island of stability centered near ds with a half life around years comparable to th after making the first isotopes of elements at the turn of the st century it was found that these neutron deficient isotopes were stabilized against fission in it was thus hypothesized that the stabilization against fission of these nuclides was due to their oblate nuclei and that a region of oblate nuclei was centred on fl also new theoretical models showed that the expected energy gap between the proton orbitals f filled at element and f filled at element was smaller than expected so element no longer appeared to be a stable spherical closed nuclear shell the next doubly magic nucleus is now expected to be around ubb but this nuclide s expected short half life and low production cross section make its synthesis challenging still the island of stability is expected to exist in this region and nearer its centre which has not been approached closely enough yet some nuclides such as mc and its alpha and beta decay daughters may be found to decay by positron emission or electron capture and thus move into the centre of the island due to the expected high fission barriers any nucleus in this island of stability would decay exclusively by alpha decay and perhaps some electron capture and beta decay both of which would bring the nuclei closer to the beta stability line where the island is expected to be electron capture is needed to reach the island which is problematic because it is not certain that electron capture is a major decay mode in this region of the chart of nuclides experiments were done in at flerov laboratory of nuclear reactions in dubna studying the fission properties of the compound nucleus fl by bombarding pu with accelerated ca ions a compound nucleus is a loose combination of nucleons that have not yet arranged themselves into nuclear shells it has no internal structure and is held together only by the collision forces between the two nuclei results showed how such nuclei fission mainly by expelling doubly magic or nearly doubly magic fragments such as ca sn pb or bi it was also found that ca and fe projectiles had a similar yield for the fusion fission pathway hence possible future use of fe projectiles in making superheavy elements it has also been suggested that a neutron rich flerovium isotope can be formed by quasifission partial fusion followed by fission of a massive nucleus recently it has been shown that multi nucleon transfer reactions in collisions of actinide nuclei such as uranium and curium might be used to make neutron rich superheavy nuclei in the island of stability though production of neutron rich nobelium or seaborgium is more likely theoretical estimates of alpha decay half lives of flerovium isotopes support the experimental data the fission survived isotope fl long expected to be doubly magic is predicted to have alpha decay half life days making fl directly by a fusion evaporation pathway is currently impossible no known combination of target and stable projectile can give neutrons for the compound nucleus and radioactive projectiles such as ca half life s cannot yet be used in the needed quantity and intensity one possibility for making the theorized long lived nuclei of copernicium cn and cn and flerovium near the middle of the island is using even heavier targets such as cm bk cf and es that when fused with ca would yield isotopes such as mc and fl as decay products of uue ts and lv which may have just enough neutrons to alpha decay to nuclides close enough to the centre of the island to possibly undergo electron capture and move inward to the centre however reaction cross sections would be small and little is yet known about the decay properties of superheavies near the beta stability line this may be the current best hope to synthesize nuclei in the island of stability but it is speculative and may or may not work in practice another possibility is to use controlled nuclear explosions to get the high neutron flux needed to make macroscopic amounts of such isotopes this would mimic the r process where the actinides were first produced in nature and the gap of instability after polonium bypassed as it would bypass the gaps of instability at fm and at mass number atomic numbers to some such isotopes especially cn and cn may even have been synthesized in nature but would decay far too quickly with half lives of only thousands of years and be produced in far too small quantities the abundance of lead to be detectable today outside cosmic rays atomic and physical flerovium is in group in the periodic table below carbon silicon germanium tin and lead every previous group element has electrons in its valence shell hence valence electron configuration ns np for flerovium the trend will continue and the valence electron configuration is predicted as s p flerovium will be similar to its lighter congeners in many ways differences are likely to arise a large contributor is spin orbit so interaction mutual interaction between the electrons motion and spin it is especially strong in superheavy elements because the electrons move faster than in lighter atoms at speeds comparable to the speed of light for flerovium it lowers the s and the p electron energy levels stabilizing the corresponding electrons but two of the p electron energy levels are stabilized more than the other four the stabilization of the s electrons is called the inert pair effect and the effect tearing the p subshell into the more and less stabilized parts is called subshell splitting computational chemists see the split as a change of the second azimuthal quantum number from to and for the more stabilized and less stabilized parts of the p subshell respectively for many theoretical purposes the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the p subshell split as s p these effects cause flerovium s chemistry to be somewhat different from that of its lighter neighbours because the spin orbit splitting of the p subshell is very large in flerovium and both of flerovium s filled orbitals in the th shell are stabilized relativistically the valence electron configuration of flerovium may be considered to have a completely filled shell its first ionization energy of ev kj mol should be the second highest in group the d electron levels are also destabilized leading to some early speculations that they may be chemically active though newer work suggests this is unlikely because the first ionization energy is higher than in silicon and germanium though still lower than in carbon it has been suggested that flerovium could be classed as a metalloid flerovium s closed shell electron configuration means metallic bonding in metallic flerovium is weaker than in the elements before and after so flerovium is expected to have a low boiling point and has recently been suggested to be possibly a gaseous metal similar to predictions for copernicium which also has a closed shell electron configuration flerovium s melting and boiling points were predicted in the s to be around and c significantly lower than for the lighter group elements lead has and c and continuing the trend of decreasing boiling points down the group earlier studies predicted a boiling point of c or c but this is now considered unlikely because of the expected weak metallic bonding and that group trends would expect flerovium to have low sublimation enthalpy preliminary calculations predicted that flerovium should have melting point c lower than mercury at c and copernicium predicted c and boiling point c which would make it a liquid metal like mercury radon and copernicium but not lead and oganesson eka radon flerovium is calculated to have no electron affinity a study published calculations predicting a hexagonal close packed crystal structure for flerovium due to spin orbit coupling effects and a density of g cm though this was noted to be probably slightly too low newer calculations published in expected flerovium to crystallize in face centred cubic crystal structure like its lighter congener lead and calculations published in predicted a density of g cm similar to lead g cm these calculations found that the face centred cubic and hexagonal close packed structures should have nearly the same energy a phenomenon reminiscent of the noble gases these calculations predict that hexagonal close packed flerovium should be a semiconductor with a band gap of ev copernicium is also predicted to be a semiconductor these calculations predict that the cohesive energy of flerovium should be around ev this is similar to that predicted for oganesson ev larger than that predicted for copernicium ev but smaller than that of mercury ev the melting point was calculated as k c so that flerovium is probably a liquid at room temperature although the boiling point was not determined the electron of a hydrogen like flerovium ion fl remove all but one electron is expected to move so fast that its mass is times that of a stationary electron due to relativistic effects the figures for hydrogen like lead and tin are expected to be and respectively flerovium would form weaker metal metal bonds than lead and would be adsorbed less on surfaces chemical flerovium is the heaviest known member of group below lead and is projected to be the second member of the p series of elements nihonium and flerovium are expected to form a very short subperiod corresponding to the filling of the p orbital coming between the filling of the d and p subshells their chemical behaviour is expected to be very distinctive nihonium s homology to thallium has been called doubtful by computational chemists while flerovium s to lead has been called only formal the first five group members show a oxidation state and the latter members have increasingly prominent chemistry due to onset of the inert pair effect for tin the and states are similar in stability and lead ii is the most stable of all the chemically well understood oxidation states in group the s orbitals are very highly stabilized in flerovium so a very large sp orbital hybridization is needed to achieve a oxidation state so flerovium is expected to be even more stable than lead in its strongly predominant oxidation state and its oxidation state should be highly unstable for example the dioxide flo is expected to be highly unstable to decomposition into its constituent elements and would not be formed by direct reaction of flerovium with oxygen and flerovane flh which should have fl h bond lengths of is predicted to be more thermodynamically unstable than plumbane spontaneously decomposing to flerovium ii hydride flh and h the tetrafluoride flf would have bonding mostly due to sd hybridizations rather than sp hybridizations and its decomposition to the difluoride and fluorine gas would be exothermic the other tetrahalides for example flcl is destabilized by about kj mol decompose similarly the corresponding polyfluoride anion flf should be unstable to hydrolysis in aqueous solution and flerovium ii polyhalide anions such as flbr and fli are predicted to form preferentially in solutions the sd hybridizations were suggested in early calculations as flerovium s s and d electrons share about the same energy which would allow a volatile hexafluoride to form but later calculations do not confirm this possibility in general spin orbit contraction of the p orbital should lead to smaller bond lengths and larger bond angles this has been theoretically confirmed in flh still even flh should be relativistically destabilized by ev to below fl h the large spin orbit effects also break down the usual singlet triplet divide in the group dihydrides flf and flcl are predicted to be more stable than flh due to relativistic stabilization of flerovium s s p valence electron configuration the oxidation state should also be more stable for flerovium than for lead as the p electrons begin to also have a mild inert pair effect this stabilization of the neutral state may bring about some similarities between the behavior of flerovium and the noble gas radon due to flerovium s expected relative inertness diatomic compounds flh and flf should have lower energies of dissociation than the corresponding lead compounds pbh and pbf flerovium iv should be even more electronegative than lead iv lead iv has electronegativity on the pauling scale though the lead ii value is only flerovium could be a noble metal flerovium ii should be more stable than lead ii and halides flx flx flx and flx x cl br i are expected to form readily the fluorides would undergo strong hydrolysis in aqueous solution all flerovium dihalides are expected to be stable the difluoride being water soluble spin orbit effects would destabilize the dihydride flh by almost ev kj mol in aqueous solution the oxyanion flerovite flo would also form analogous to plumbite flerovium ii sulfate flso and sulfide fls should be very insoluble in water and flerovium ii acetate flc h o and nitrate fl no should be quite water soluble the standard electrode potential for reduction of fl ion to metallic flerovium is estimated to be around v confirming the increased stability of flerovium in the neutral state in general due to relativistic stabilization of the p spinor fl is expected to have properties intermediate between those of hg or cd and its lighter congener pb experimental chemistry flerovium is currently the last element whose chemistry has been experimentally investigated though studies so far are not conclusive two experiments were done in april may in a joint flnr psi collaboration to study copernicium chemistry the first experiment used the reaction pu ca n fl and the second pu ca n fl these reactions give short lived flerovium isotopes whose copernicium daughters would then be studied adsorption properties of the resultant atoms on a gold surface were compared to those of radon as it was then expected that copernicium s full shell electron configuration would lead to noble gas like behavior noble gases interact with metal surfaces very weakly which is uncharacteristic of metals the first experiment found atoms of cn but seemingly also atom of fl this was a surprise transport time for the product atoms is s so the flerovium should have decayed to copernicium before adsorption in the second reaction atoms of fl and possibly of fl were seen two of the three atoms showed adsorption characteristics associated with a volatile noble gas like element which has been suggested but is not predicted by more recent calculations these experiments gave independent confirmation for the discovery of copernicium flerovium and livermorium via comparison with published decay data further experiments in to confirm this important result detected atom of fl and supported previous data showing flerovium had a noble gas like interaction with gold empirical support for a noble gas like flerovium soon weakened in and the flnr psi collaboration synthesized more flerovium to follow up their and studies in particular the first three flerovium atoms made in the study suggested again a noble gas like character but the complete set taken together resulted in a more ambiguous interpretation unusual for a metal in the carbon group but not fully like a noble gas in character in their paper the scientists refrained from calling flerovium s chemical properties close to those of noble gases as had previously been done in the study flerovium s volatility was again measured through interactions with a gold surface and provided indications that the volatility of flerovium was comparable to that of mercury astatine and the simultaneously investigated copernicium which had been shown in the study to be a very volatile noble metal conforming to its being the heaviest known group element still it was pointed out that this volatile behavior was not expected for a usual group metal in experiments in at gsi flerovium s chemistry was found to be more metallic than noble gas like jens volker kratz and christoph d llmann specifically named copernicium and flerovium as being in a new category of volatile metals kratz even speculated that they might be gases at standard temperature and pressure these volatile metals as a category were expected to fall between normal metals and noble gases in terms of adsorption properties contrary to the and results it was shown in the experiments that the interactions of flerovium and copernicium respectively with gold were about equal further studies showed that flerovium was more reactive than copernicium in contradiction to previous experiments and predictions in a paper detailing the experimental results of the chemical characterization of flerovium the gsi group wrote flerovium is the least reactive element in the group but still a metal nevertheless in a conference about chemistry and physics of heavy and superheavy elements alexander yakushev and robert eichler two scientists who had been active at gsi and flnr in determining flerovium s chemistry still urged caution based on the inconsistencies of the various experiments previously listed noting that the question of whether flerovium was a metal or a noble gas was still open with the known evidence one study suggested a weak noble gas like interaction between flerovium and gold while the other suggested a stronger metallic interaction the longer lived isotope fl has been considered of interest for future radiochemical studies new experiments published in suggest that flerovium is a metal exhibiting lower reactivity towards gold than mercury but higher reactivity than radon the experiments could not identify if the adsorption was due to elemental flerovium considered more likely or if it was due to a flerovium compound such as flo that was more reactive towards gold than elemental flerovium but both scenarios involve flerovium forming chemical bonds ,114
Moscovium,Mc,moscovium is a synthetic element with the symbol mc and atomic number it was first synthesized in by a joint team of russian and american scientists at the joint institute for nuclear research jinr in dubna russia in december it was recognized as one of four new elements by the joint working party of international scientific bodies iupac and iupap on november it was officially named after the moscow oblast in which the jinr is situated moscovium is an extremely radioactive element its most stable known isotope moscovium has a half life of only seconds in the periodic table it is a p block transactinide element it is a member of the th period and is placed in group as the heaviest pnictogen although it has not been confirmed to behave as a heavier homologue of the pnictogen bismuth moscovium is calculated to have some properties similar to its lighter homologues nitrogen phosphorus arsenic antimony and bismuth and to be a post transition metal although it should also show several major differences from them in particular moscovium should also have significant similarities to thallium as both have one rather loosely bound electron outside a quasi closed shell over a hundred atoms of moscovium have been observed to date all of which have been shown to have mass numbers from to introduction the heaviest atomic nuclei are created in nuclear reactions that combine two other nuclei of unequal size into one roughly the more unequal the two nuclei in terms of mass the greater the possibility that the two react the material made of the heavier nuclei is made into a target which is then bombarded by the beam of lighter nuclei two nuclei can only fuse into one if they approach each other closely enough normally nuclei all positively charged repel each other due to electrostatic repulsion the strong interaction can overcome this repulsion but only within a very short distance from a nucleus beam nuclei are thus greatly accelerated in order to make such repulsion insignificant compared to the velocity of the beam nucleus coming close alone is not enough for two nuclei to fuse when two nuclei approach each other they usually remain together for approximately seconds and then part ways not necessarily in the same composition as before the reaction rather than form a single nucleus if fusion does occur the temporary merger termed a compound nucleus is an excited state to lose its excitation energy and reach a more stable state a compound nucleus either fissions or ejects one or several neutrons which carry away the energy this occurs in approximately seconds after the initial collision the beam passes through the target and reaches the next chamber the separator if a new nucleus is produced it is carried with this beam in the separator the newly produced nucleus is separated from other nuclides that of the original beam and any other reaction products and transferred to a surface barrier detector which stops the nucleus the exact location of the upcoming impact on the detector is marked also marked are its energy and the time of the arrival the transfer takes about seconds in order to be detected the nucleus must survive this long the nucleus is recorded again once its decay is registered and the location the energy and the time of the decay are measured stability of a nucleus is provided by the strong interaction however its range is very short as nuclei become larger their influence on the outermost nucleons protons and neutrons weakens at the same time the nucleus is torn apart by electrostatic repulsion between protons as it has unlimited range nuclei of the heaviest elements are thus theoretically predicted and have so far been observed to primarily decay via decay modes that are caused by such repulsion alpha decay and spontaneous fission these modes are predominant for nuclei of superheavy elements alpha decays are registered by the emitted alpha particles and the decay products are easy to determine before the actual decay if such a decay or a series of consecutive decays produces a known nucleus the original product of a reaction can be determined arithmetically spontaneous fission however produces various nuclei as products so the original nuclide cannot be determined from its daughters the information available to physicists aiming to synthesize one of the heaviest elements is thus the information collected at the detectors location energy and time of arrival of a particle to the detector and those of its decay the physicists analyze this data and seek to conclude that it was indeed caused by a new element and could not have been caused by a different nuclide than the one claimed often provided data is insufficient for a conclusion that a new element was definitely created and there is no other explanation for the observed effects errors in interpreting data have been made history discovery the first successful synthesis of moscovium was by a joint team of russian and american scientists in august at the joint institute for nuclear research jinr in dubna russia headed by russian nuclear physicist yuri oganessian the team included american scientists of the lawrence livermore national laboratory the researchers on february stated in physical review c that they bombarded americium with calcium ions to produce four atoms of moscovium these atoms decayed by emission of alpha particles to nihonium in about milliseconds the dubna livermore collaboration strengthened their claim to the discoveries of moscovium and nihonium by conducting chemical experiments on the final decay product db none of the nuclides in this decay chain were previously known so existing experimental data was not available to support their claim in june and december the presence of a dubnium isotope was confirmed by extracting the final decay products measuring spontaneous fission sf activities and using chemical identification techniques to confirm that they behave like a group element as dubnium is known to be in group of the periodic table both the half life and the decay mode were confirmed for the proposed db lending support to the assignment of the parent nucleus to moscovium however in the iupac iupap joint working party jwp did not recognize the two elements as having been discovered because current theory could not distinguish the chemical properties of group and group elements with sufficient confidence furthermore the decay properties of all the nuclei in the decay chain of moscovium had not been previously characterized before the dubna experiments a situation which the jwp generally considers troublesome but not necessarily exclusive road to confirmation two heavier isotopes of moscovium mc and mc were discovered in as daughters of the tennessine isotopes ts and ts the isotope mc was later also synthesized directly and confirmed to have the same properties as found in the tennessine experiments in the joint working party of international scientific bodies international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac and international union of pure and applied physics iupap evaluated the and dubna experiments and concluded that they did not meet the criteria for discovery another evaluation of more recent experiments took place within the next few years and a claim to the discovery of moscovium was again put forward by dubna in august a team of researchers at lund university and at the gesellschaft f r schwerionenforschung gsi in darmstadt germany announced they had repeated the experiment confirming dubna s findings simultaneously the experiment had been repeated at dubna now additionally also creating the isotope mc that could serve as a cross bombardment for confirming the discovery of the tennessine isotope ts in further confirmation was published by the team at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in in december the iupac iupap joint working party recognized the element s discovery and assigned the priority to the dubna livermore collaboration of giving them the right to suggest a permanent name for it while they did not recognise the experiments synthesising mc and mc as persuasive due to the lack of a convincing identification of atomic number via cross reactions they recognised the ts experiments as persuasive because its daughter mc had been produced independently and found to exhibit the same properties in may lund university lund scania sweden and gsi cast some doubt on the syntheses of moscovium and tennessine the decay chains assigned to mc the isotope instrumental in the confirmation of the syntheses of moscovium and tennessine were found based on a new statistical method to be too different to belong to the same nuclide with a reasonably high probability the reported ts decay chains approved as such by the jwp were found to require splitting into individual data sets assigned to different tennessine isotopes it was also found that the claimed link between the decay chains reported as from ts and mc probably did not exist on the other hand the chains from the non approved isotope ts were found to be congruent the multiplicity of states found when nuclides that are not even even undergo alpha decay is not unexpected and contributes to the lack of clarity in the cross reactions this study criticized the jwp report for overlooking subtleties associated with this issue and considered it problematic that the only argument for the acceptance of the discoveries of moscovium and tennessine was a link they considered to be doubtful on june two members of the dubna team published a journal article answering these criticisms analysing their data on the nuclides ts and mc with widely accepted statistical methods noted that the studies indicating non congruence produced problematic results when applied to radioactive decay they excluded from the confidence interval both average and extreme decay times and the decay chains that would be excluded from the confidence interval they chose were more probable to be observed than those that would be included the reanalysis concluded that the observed decay chains of ts and mc were consistent with the assumption that only one nuclide was present at each step of the chain although it would be desirable to be able to directly measure the mass number of the originating nucleus of each chain as well as the excitation function of the am ca reaction naming using mendeleev s nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements moscovium is sometimes known as eka bismuth in iupac recommended that the placeholder systematic element name ununpentium with the corresponding symbol of uup be used until the discovery of the element is confirmed and a permanent name is decided although widely used in the chemical community on all levels from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field who called it element with the symbol of e or even simply on december discovery of the element was recognized by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac according to iupac recommendations the discoverer s of a new element has the right to suggest a name a suggested name was langevinium after paul langevin later the dubna team mentioned the name moscovium several times as one among many possibilities referring to the moscow oblast where dubna is located in june iupac endorsed the latter proposal to be formally accepted by the end of the year which it was on november the naming ceremony for moscovium tennessine and oganesson was held on march at the russian academy of sciences in moscow predicted properties other than nuclear properties no properties of moscovium or its compounds have been measured this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that it decays very quickly properties of moscovium remain unknown and only predictions are available nuclear stability and isotopes moscovium is expected to be within an island of stability centered on copernicium element and flerovium element due to the expected high fission barriers any nucleus within this island of stability exclusively decays by alpha decay and perhaps some electron capture and beta decay although the known isotopes of moscovium do not actually have enough neutrons to be on the island of stability they can be seen to approach the island as in general the heavier isotopes are the longer lived ones the hypothetical isotope mc is an especially interesting case as it has only one neutron more than the heaviest known moscovium isotope mc it could plausibly be synthesized as the daughter of ts which in turn could be made from the reaction bk ca n ts calculations show that it may have a significant electron capture or positron emission decay mode in addition to alpha decay and also have a relatively long half life of several seconds this would produce fl nh and finally cn which is expected to be in the middle of the island of stability and have a half life of about years affording the most likely hope of reaching the middle of the island using current technology possible drawbacks are that the cross section of the production reaction of ts is expected to be low and the decay properties of superheavy nuclei this close to the line of beta stability are largely unexplored the light isotopes mc mc and mc could be made from the am ca reaction they would undergo a chain of alpha decays ending at transactinide isotopes too light to be made by hot fusion and too heavy to be made by cold fusion the isotope mc was found in at dubna in the am ca n mc reaction it decays into the already known nh and its daughters other possibilities to synthesize nuclei on the island of stability include quasifission partial fusion followed by fission of a massive nucleus such nuclei tend to fission expelling doubly magic or nearly doubly magic fragments such as calcium tin lead or bismuth recently it has been shown that the multi nucleon transfer reactions in collisions of actinide nuclei such as uranium and curium might be used to synthesize the neutron rich superheavy nuclei located at the island of stability although formation of the lighter elements nobelium or seaborgium is more favored one last possibility to synthesize isotopes near the island is to use controlled nuclear explosions to create a neutron flux high enough to bypass the gaps of instability at fm and at mass number atomic numbers to mimicking the r process in which the actinides were first produced in nature and the gap of instability around radon bypassed some such isotopes especially cn and cn may even have been synthesized in nature but would have decayed away far too quickly with half lives of only thousands of years and be produced in far too small quantities about the abundance of lead to be detectable as primordial nuclides today outside cosmic rays physical and atomic in the periodic table moscovium is a member of group the pnictogens it appears below nitrogen phosphorus arsenic antimony and bismuth every previous pnictogen has five electrons in its valence shell forming a valence electron configuration of ns np in moscovium s case the trend should be continued and the valence electron configuration is predicted to be s p therefore moscovium will behave similarly to its lighter congeners in many respects however notable differences are likely to arise a largely contributing effect is the spin orbit so interaction the mutual interaction between the electrons motion and spin it is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move much faster than in lighter atoms at velocities comparable to the speed of light in relation to moscovium atoms it lowers the s and the p electron energy levels stabilizing the corresponding electrons but two of the p electron energy levels are stabilized more than the other four the stabilization of the s electrons is called the inert pair effect and the effect tearing the p subshell into the more stabilized and the less stabilized parts is called subshell splitting computation chemists see the split as a change of the second azimuthal quantum number l from to and for the more stabilized and less stabilized parts of the p subshell respectively for many theoretical purposes the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the p subshell split as s p p these effects cause moscovium s chemistry to be somewhat different from that of its lighter congeners the valence electrons of moscovium fall into three subshells s two electrons p two electrons and p one electron the first two of these are relativistically stabilized and hence behave as inert pairs while the last is relativistically destabilized and can easily participate in chemistry the d electrons are not destabilized enough to participate chemically although this may still be possible in the two previous elements nihonium and flerovium thus the oxidation state should be favored like tl and consistent with this the first ionization potential of moscovium should be around ev continuing the trend towards lower ionization potentials down the pnictogens moscovium and nihonium both have one electron outside a quasi closed shell configuration that can be delocalized in the metallic state thus they should have similar melting and boiling points both melting around c and boiling around c due to the strength of their metallic bonds being similar additionally the predicted ionization potential ionic radius for mc for mc and polarizability of mc are expected to be more similar to tl than its true congener bi moscovium should be a dense metal due to its high atomic weight with a density around g cm the electron of the hydrogen like moscovium atom oxidized so that it only has one electron mc is expected to move so fast that it has a mass times that of a stationary electron due to relativistic effects for comparison the figures for hydrogen like bismuth and antimony are expected to be and respectively chemical moscovium is predicted to be the third member of the p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group in the periodic table below bismuth unlike the two previous p elements moscovium is expected to be a good homologue of its lighter congener in this case bismuth in this group each member is known to portray the group oxidation state of but with differing stability for nitrogen the state is mostly a formal explanation of molecules like n o it is very difficult to have five covalent bonds to nitrogen due to the inability of the small nitrogen atom to accommodate five ligands the state is well represented for the essentially non relativistic typical pnictogens phosphorus arsenic and antimony however for bismuth it becomes rare due to the relativistic stabilization of the s orbitals known as the inert pair effect so that the s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically it is expected that moscovium will have an inert pair effect for both the s and the p electrons as the binding energy of the lone p electron is noticeably lower than that of the p electrons nitrogen i and bismuth i are known but rare and moscovium i is likely to show some unique properties probably behaving more like thallium i than bismuth i because of spin orbit coupling flerovium may display closed shell or noble gas like properties if this is the case moscovium will likely be typically monovalent as a result since the cation mc will have the same electron configuration as flerovium perhaps giving moscovium some alkali metal character calculations predict that moscovium i fluoride and chloride would be ionic compounds with an ionic radius of about pm for mc although the p lone pair on the mc ion should be highly polarisable the mc cation should behave like its true lighter homolog bi the s electrons are too stabilized to be able to contribute chemically and hence the state should be impossible and moscovium may be considered to have only three valence electrons moscovium would be quite a reactive metal with a standard reduction potential of v for the mc mc couple the chemistry of moscovium in aqueous solution should essentially be that of the mc and mc ions the former should be easily hydrolyzed and not be easily complexed with halides cyanide and ammonia moscovium i hydroxide mcoh carbonate mc co oxalate mc c o and fluoride mcf should be soluble in water the sulfide mc s should be insoluble and the chloride mccl bromide mcbr iodide mci and thiocyanate mcscn should be only slightly soluble so that adding excess hydrochloric acid would not noticeably affect the solubility of moscovium i chloride mc should be about as stable as tl and hence should also be an important part of moscovium chemistry although its closest homolog among the elements should be its lighter congener bi moscovium iii fluoride mcf and thiozonide mcs should be insoluble in water similar to the corresponding bismuth compounds while moscovium iii chloride mccl bromide mcbr and iodide mci should be readily soluble and easily hydrolyzed to form oxyhalides such as mcocl and mcobr again analogous to bismuth both moscovium i and moscovium iii should be common oxidation states and their relative stability should depend greatly on what they are complexed with and the likelihood of hydrolysis like its lighter homologues ammonia phosphine arsine stibine and bismuthine moscovine mch is expected to have a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry with an mc h bond length of pm and a h mc h bond angle of bismuthine has bond length pm and bond angle stibine has bond length pm and bond angle in the predicted aromatic pentagonal planar mc cluster analogous to pentazolate n the mc mc bond length is expected to be expanded from the extrapolated value of pm to pm due to spin orbit coupling effects experimental chemistry unambiguous determination of the chemical characteristics of moscovium has yet to have been established in experiments were conducted to create nihonium flerovium and moscovium isotopes in the reactions between calcium projectiles and targets of americium and plutonium however the targets included lead and bismuth impurities and hence some isotopes of bismuth and polonium were generated in nucleon transfer reactions this while an unforeseen complication could give information that would help in the future chemical investigation of the heavier homologs of bismuth and polonium which are respectively moscovium and livermorium the produced nuclides bismuth and polonium m were transported as the hydrides bih and mpoh at c through a quartz wool filter unit held with tantalum showing that these hydrides were surprisingly thermally stable although their heavier congeners mch and lvh would be expected to be less thermally stable from simple extrapolation of periodic trends in the p block further calculations on the stability and electronic structure of bih mch poh and lvh are needed before chemical investigations take place however moscovium and livermorium are expected to be volatile enough as pure elements for them to be chemically investigated in the near future the moscovium isotopes mc mc and mc may be chemically investigated with current methods although their short half lives would make this challenging moscovium is the heaviest element that has known isotopes that are long lived enough for chemical experimentation ,115
Livermorium,Lv,livermorium is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol lv and has an atomic number of it is an extremely radioactive element that has only been created in a laboratory setting and has not been observed in nature the element is named after the lawrence livermore national laboratory in the united states which collaborated with the joint institute for nuclear research jinr in dubna russia to discover livermorium during experiments conducted between and the name of the laboratory refers to the city of livermore california where it is located which in turn was named after the rancher and landowner robert livermore the name was adopted by iupac on may four isotopes of livermorium are known with mass numbers between and inclusive the longest lived among them is livermorium with a half life of about milliseconds a fifth possible isotope with mass number has been reported but not yet confirmed in the periodic table it is a p block transactinide element it is a member of the th period and is placed in group as the heaviest chalcogen but it has not been confirmed to behave as the heavier homologue to the chalcogen polonium livermorium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues oxygen sulfur selenium tellurium and polonium and be a post transition metal though it should also show several major differences from them

claimed often provided data is insufficient for a conclusion that a new element was definitely created and there is no other explanation for the observed effects errors in interpreting data have been made history unsuccessful synthesis attempts the first search for element using the reaction between cm and ca was performed in by ken hulet and his team at the lawrence livermore national laboratory llnl they were unable to detect any atoms of livermorium yuri oganessian and his team at the flerov laboratory of nuclear reactions flnr in the joint institute for nuclear research jinr subsequently attempted the reaction in and met failure in in a joint experiment between berkeley and peter armbruster s team at gsi the result was again negative with a calculated cross section limit of pb work on reactions with ca which had proved very useful in the synthesis of nobelium from the natpb ca reaction nevertheless continued at dubna with a superheavy element separator being developed in a search for target materials and starting of collaborations with llnl being started in production of more intense ca beams being started in and preparations for long term experiments with orders of magnitude higher sensitivity being performed in the early s this work led directly to the production of new isotopes of elements to in the reactions of ca with actinide targets and the discovery of the heaviest elements on the periodic table flerovium moscovium livermorium tennessine and oganesson in an international team led by sigurd hofmann at the gesellschaft f r schwerionenforschung gsi in darmstadt germany attempted to synthesise element in a radiative capture reaction in which the compound nucleus de excites through pure gamma emission without evaporating neutrons between a lead target and selenium projectiles no atoms of element were identified unconfirmed discovery claims in late polish physicist robert smola czuk published calculations on the fusion of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of superheavy atoms including elements and his calculations suggested that it might be possible to make these two elements by fusing lead with krypton under carefully controlled conditions in researchers at lawrence berkeley national laboratory made use of these predictions and announced the discovery of elements and in a paper published in physical review letters and very soon after the results were reported in science the researchers reported to have performed the reaction kr pb og n lv the following year they published a retraction after researchers at other laboratories were unable to duplicate the results and the berkeley lab itself was unable to duplicate them as well in june the director of the lab announced that the original claim of the discovery of these two elements had been based on data fabricated by principal author victor ninov discovery livermorium was first synthesized on july when scientists at dubna jinr bombarded a curium target with accelerated calcium ions a single atom was detected decaying by alpha emission with decay energy mev to an isotope of flerovium the results were published in december cm ca lv lv n fl the daughter flerovium isotope had properties matching those of a flerovium isotope first synthesized in june which was originally assigned to fl implying an assignment of the parent livermorium isotope to lv later work in december indicated that the synthesized flerovium isotope was actually fl and hence the assignment of the synthesized livermorium atom was correspondingly altered to lv road to confirmation two further atoms were reported by the institute during their second experiment during april may in the same experiment they also detected a decay chain which corresponded to the first observed decay of flerovium in december which had been assigned to fl no flerovium isotope with the same properties as the one found in december has ever been observed again even in repeats of the same reaction later it was found that fl has different decay properties and that the first observed flerovium atom may have been its nuclear isomer mfl the observation of mfl in this series of experiments may indicate the formation of a parent isomer of livermorium namely mlv or a rare and previously unobserved decay branch of the already discovered state lv to mfl neither possibility is certain and research is required to positively assign this activity another possibility suggested is the assignment of the original december atom to fl as the low beam energy used in that original experiment makes the n channel plausible its parent could then conceivably be lv but this assignment would still need confirmation in the cm ca n lv reaction the team repeated the experiment in april may and detected atoms of livermorium the measured decay data confirmed the assignment of the first discovered isotope as lv in this run the team also observed the isotope lv for the first time in further experiments from to the team replaced the curium target with the lighter curium isotope curium here evidence was found for the two isotopes lv and lv in may the iupac iupap joint working party reported on the discovery of copernicium and acknowledged the discovery of the isotope cn this implied the de facto discovery of the isotope lv from the acknowledgment of the data relating to its granddaughter cn although the livermorium data was not absolutely critical for the demonstration of copernicium s discovery also in confirmation from berkeley and the gesellschaft f r schwerionenforschung gsi in germany came for the flerovium isotopes to immediate daughters of the four known livermorium isotopes in iupac evaluated the dubna team experiments of whereas they found the earliest data not involving lv and cn inconclusive the results of were accepted as identification of livermorium and the element was officially recognized as having been discovered the synthesis of livermorium has been separately confirmed at the gsi and riken and in the gsi experiment one chain tentatively assigned to lv was shown to be inconsistent with previous data it is believed that this chain may instead originate from an isomeric state mlv in the riken experiment one atom that may be assigned to lv was seemingly detected alpha decaying to fl and cn which underwent spontaneous fission however the first alpha from the livermorium nuclide produced was missed and the assignment to lv is still uncertain though plausible naming using mendeleev s nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements livermorium is sometimes called eka polonium in iupac recommended that the placeholder systematic element name ununhexium uuh be used until the discovery of the element was confirmed and a name was decided although widely used in the chemical community on all levels from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field who called it element with the symbol of e or even simply according to iupac recommendations the discoverer or discoverers of a new element have the right to suggest a name the discovery of livermorium was recognized by the joint working party jwp of iupac on june along with that of flerovium according to the vice director of jinr the dubna team originally wanted to name element moscovium after the moscow oblast in which dubna is located but it was later decided to use this name for element instead the name livermorium and the symbol lv were adopted on may the name recognises the lawrence livermore national laboratory within the city of livermore california usa which collaborated with jinr on the discovery the city in turn is named after the american rancher robert livermore a naturalized mexican citizen of english birth the naming ceremony for flerovium and livermorium was held in moscow on october predicted properties other than nuclear properties no properties of livermorium or its compounds have been measured this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that it decays very quickly properties of livermorium remain unknown and only predictions are available nuclear stability and isotopes livermorium is expected to be near an island of stability centered on copernicium element and flerovium element due to the expected high fission barriers any nucleus within this island of stability exclusively decays by alpha decay and perhaps some electron capture and beta decay while the known isotopes of livermorium do not actually have enough neutrons to be on the island of stability they can be seen to approach the island as the heavier isotopes are generally the longer lived ones superheavy elements are produced by nuclear fusion these fusion reactions can be divided into hot and cold fusion depending on the excitation energy of the compound nucleus produced in hot fusion reactions very light high energy projectiles are accelerated toward very heavy targets actinides giving rise to compound nuclei at high excitation energy mev that may either fission or evaporate several to neutrons in cold fusion reactions which use heavier projectiles typically from the fourth period and lighter targets usually lead and bismuth the produced fused nuclei have a relatively low excitation energy mev which decreases the probability that these products will undergo fission reactions as the fused nuclei cool to the ground state they require emission of only one or two neutrons hot fusion reactions tend to produce more neutron rich products because the actinides have the highest neutron to proton ratios of any elements that can presently be made in macroscopic quantities important information could be gained regarding the properties of superheavy nuclei by the synthesis of more livermorium isotopes specifically those with a few neutrons more or less than the known ones lv lv lv lv lv and lv this is possible because there are many reasonably long lived isotopes of curium that can be used to make a target the light isotopes can be made by fusing curium with calcium they would undergo a chain of alpha decays ending at transactinide isotopes that are too light to achieve by hot fusion and too heavy to be produced by cold fusion the synthesis of the heavy isotopes lv and lv could be accomplished by fusing the heavy curium isotope curium with calcium the cross section of this nuclear reaction would be about picobarn though it is not yet possible to produce cm in the quantities needed for target manufacture after a few alpha decays these livermorium isotopes would reach nuclides at the line of beta stability additionally electron capture may also become an important decay mode in this region allowing affected nuclei to reach the middle of the island for example it is predicted that lv would alpha decay to fl which would undergo successive electron capture to nh and then cn which is expected to be in the middle of the island of stability and have a half life of about years affording the most likely hope of reaching the middle of the island using current technology a drawback is that the decay properties of superheavy nuclei this close to the line of beta stability are largely unexplored other possibilities to synthesize nuclei on the island of stability include quasifission partial fusion followed by fission of a massive nucleus such nuclei tend to fission expelling doubly magic or nearly doubly magic fragments such as calcium tin lead or bismuth recently it has been shown that the multi nucleon transfer reactions in collisions of actinide nuclei such as uranium and curium might be used to synthesize the neutron rich superheavy nuclei located at the island of stability although formation of the lighter elements nobelium or seaborgium is more favored one last possibility to synthesize isotopes near the island is to use controlled nuclear explosions to create a neutron flux high enough to bypass the gaps of instability at fm and at mass number atomic numbers to mimicking the r process in which the actinides were first produced in nature and the gap of instability around radon bypassed some such isotopes especially cn and cn may even have been synthesized in nature but would have decayed away far too quickly with half lives of only thousands of years and be produced in far too small quantities about the abundance of lead to be detectable as primordial nuclides today outside cosmic rays physical and atomic in the periodic table livermorium is a member of group the chalcogens it appears below oxygen sulfur selenium tellurium and polonium every previous chalcogen has six electrons in its valence shell forming a valence electron configuration of ns np in livermorium s case the trend should be continued and the valence electron configuration is predicted to be s p therefore livermorium will have some similarities to its lighter congeners differences are likely to arise a large contributing effect is the spin orbit so interaction the mutual interaction between the electrons motion and spin it is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move much faster than in lighter atoms at velocities comparable to the speed of light in relation to livermorium atoms it lowers the s and the p electron energy levels stabilizing the corresponding electrons but two of the p electron energy levels are stabilized more than the other four the stabilization of the s electrons is called the inert pair effect and the effect tearing the p subshell into the more stabilized and the less stabilized parts is called subshell splitting computation chemists see the split as a change of the second azimuthal quantum number l from to and for the more stabilized and less stabilized parts of the p subshell respectively the p subshell acts as a second inert pair though not as inert as the s electrons while the p subshell can easily participate in chemistry for many theoretical purposes the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the p subshell split as s p p inert pair effects in livermorium should be even stronger than in polonium and hence the oxidation state becomes more stable than the state which would be stabilized only by the most electronegative ligands this is reflected in the expected ionization energies of livermorium where there are large gaps between the second and third ionization energies corresponding to the breaching of the unreactive p shell and fourth and fifth ionization energies indeed the s electrons are expected to be so inert that the state will not be attainable the melting and boiling points of livermorium are expected to continue the trends down the chalcogens thus livermorium should melt at a higher temperature than polonium but boil at a lower temperature it should also be denser than polonium lv g cm po g cm like polonium it should also form an and a allotrope the electron of a hydrogen like livermorium atom oxidized so that it only has one electron lv is expected to move so fast that it has a mass times that of a stationary electron due to relativistic effects for comparison the figures for hydrogen like polonium and tellurium are expected to be and respectively chemical livermorium is projected to be the fourth member of the p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group in the periodic table below polonium while it is the least theoretically studied of the p elements its chemistry is expected to be quite similar to that of polonium the group oxidation state of is known for all the chalcogens apart from oxygen which cannot expand its octet and is one of the strongest oxidizing agents among the chemical elements oxygen is thus limited to a maximum state exhibited in the fluoride of the state is known for sulfur selenium tellurium and polonium undergoing a shift in stability from reducing for sulfur iv and selenium iv through being the most stable state for tellurium iv to being oxidizing in polonium iv this suggests a decreasing stability for the higher oxidation states as the group is descended due to the increasing importance of relativistic effects especially the inert pair effect the most stable oxidation state of livermorium should thus be with a rather unstable state the state should be about as easy to form as it is for beryllium and magnesium and the state should only be achieved with strongly electronegative ligands such as in livermorium iv fluoride lvf the state should not exist at all due to the very strong stabilization of the s electrons making the valence core of livermorium only four electrons the lighter chalcogens are also known to form a state as oxide sulfide selenide telluride and polonide due to the destabilization of livermorium s p subshell the state should be very unstable for livermorium whose chemistry should be essentially purely cationic though the larger subshell and spinor energy splittings of livermorium as compared to polonium should make lv slightly less unstable than expected livermorium hydride lvh would be the heaviest chalcogen hydride and the heaviest homolog of water the lighter ones are h s h se h te and poh polane polonium hydride is a more covalent compound than most metal hydrides because polonium straddles the border between metal and metalloid and has some nonmetallic properties it is intermediate between a hydrogen halide like hydrogen chloride hcl and a metal hydride like stannane snh livermorane should continue this trend it should be a hydride rather than a livermoride but still a covalent molecular compound spin orbit interactions are expected to make the lv h bond longer than expected from periodic trends alone and make the h lv h bond angle larger than expected this is theorized to be because the unoccupied s orbitals are relatively low in energy and can hybridize with the valence p orbitals of livermorium this phenomenon dubbed supervalent hybridization has some analogues in non relativistic regions in the periodic table for example molecular calcium difluoride has s and d involvement from the calcium atom the heavier livermorium dihalides are predicted to be linear but the lighter ones are predicted to be bent experimental chemistry unambiguous determination of the chemical characteristics of livermorium has not yet been established in experiments were conducted to create nihonium flerovium and moscovium isotopes in the reactions between calcium projectiles and targets of americium and plutonium the targets included lead and bismuth impurities and hence some isotopes of bismuth and polonium were generated in nucleon transfer reactions this while an unforeseen complication could give information that would help in the future chemical investigation of the heavier homologs of bismuth and polonium which are respectively moscovium and livermorium the produced nuclides bismuth and polonium m were transported as the hydrides bih and mpoh at c through a quartz wool filter unit held with tantalum showing that these hydrides were surprisingly thermally stable although their heavier congeners mch and lvh would be expected to be less thermally stable from simple extrapolation of periodic trends in the p block further calculations on the stability and electronic structure of bih mch poh and lvh are needed before chemical investigations take place moscovium and livermorium are expected to be volatile enough as pure elements for them to be chemically investigated in the near future a property livermorium would then share with its lighter congener polonium though the short half lives of all presently known livermorium isotopes means that the element is still inaccessible to experimental chemistry ,116
Tennessine,Ts,tennessine is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol ts and atomic number it is the second heaviest known element and the penultimate element of the th period of the periodic table the discovery of tennessine was officially announced in dubna russia by a russian american collaboration in april which makes it the most recently discovered element as of one of its daughter isotopes was created directly in partially confirming the results of the experiment the experiment itself was repeated successfully by the same collaboration in and by a joint german american team in may in december the joint working party of the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac and the international union of pure and applied physics iupap which evaluates claims of discovery of new elements recognized the element and assigned the priority to the russian american team in june the iupac published a declaration stating that the discoverers had suggested the name tennessine after tennessee united states a name which was officially adopted in november tennessine may be located in the island of stability a concept that explains why some superheavy elements are more stable compared to an overall trend of decreasing stability for elements beyond bismuth on the periodic table the synthesized tennessine atoms have lasted tens and hundreds of milliseconds in the periodic table tennessine is expected to be a member of group all other members of which are halogens some of its properties may differ significantly from those of the halogens due to relativistic effects as a result tennessine is expected to be a volatile metal that neither forms anions nor achieves high oxidation states a few key properties such as its melting and boiling points and its first ionization energy are nevertheless expected to follow the periodic trends of the halogens introduction the heaviest atomic nuclei are created in nuclear reactions that combine two other nuclei of unequal size into one roughly the more unequal the two nuclei in terms of mass the greater the possibility that the two react the material made of the heavier nuclei is made into a target which is then bombarded by the beam of lighter nuclei two nuclei can only fuse into one if they approach each other closely enough normally nuclei all positively charged repel each other due to electrostatic repulsion the strong interaction can overcome this repulsion but only within a very short distance from a nucleus beam nuclei are thus greatly accelerated in order to make such repulsion insignificant compared to the velocity of the beam nucleus coming close alone is not enough for two nuclei to fuse when two nuclei approach each other they usually remain together for approximately seconds and then part ways not necessarily in the same composition as before the reaction rather than form a single nucleus if fusion does occur the temporary merger termed a compound nucleus is an excited state to lose its excitation energy and reach a more stable state a compound nucleus either fissions or ejects one or several neutrons which carry away the energy this occurs in approximately seconds after the initial collision the beam passes through the target and reaches the next chamber the separator if a new nucleus is produced it is carried with this beam in the separator the newly produced nucleus is separated from other nuclides that of the original beam and any other reaction products and transferred to a surface barrier detector which stops the nucleus the exact location of the upcoming impact on the detector is marked also marked are its energy and the time of the arrival the transfer takes about seconds in order to be detected the nucleus must survive this long the nucleus is recorded again once its decay is registered and the location the energy and the time of the decay are measured stability of a nucleus is provided by the strong interaction however its range is very short as nuclei become larger their influence on the outermost nucleons protons and neutrons weakens at the same time the nucleus is torn apart by electrostatic repulsion between protons as it has unlimited range nuclei of the heaviest elements are thus theoretically predicted and have so far been observed to primarily decay via decay modes that are caused by such repulsion alpha decay and spontaneous fission these modes are predominant for nuclei of superheavy elements alpha decays are registered by the emitted alpha particles and the decay products are easy to determine before the actual decay if such a decay or a series of consecutive decays produces a known nucleus the original product of a reaction can be determined arithmetically spontaneous fission however produces various nuclei as products so the original nuclide cannot be determined from its daughters the information available to physicists aiming to synthesize one of the heaviest elements is thus the information collected at the detectors location energy and time of arrival of a particle to the detector and those of its decay the physicists analyze this data and seek to conclude that it was indeed caused by a new element and could not have been caused by a different nuclide than the one claimed often provided data is insufficient for a conclusion that a new element was definitely created and there is no other explanation for the observed effects errors in interpreting data have been made history pre discovery in december the joint institute for nuclear research jinr team in dubna moscow oblast russia proposed a joint experiment with the oak ridge national laboratory ornl in oak ridge tennessee united states to synthesize element so called for the protons in its nucleus their proposal involved fusing a berkelium element target and a calcium element beam conducted via bombardment of the berkelium target with calcium nuclei this would complete a set of experiments done at the jinr on the fusion of actinide targets with a calcium beam which had thus far produced the new elements and the ornl then the world s only producer of berkelium could not then provide the element as they had temporarily ceased production and re initiating it would be too costly plans to synthesize element were suspended in favor of the confirmation of element which had been produced earlier in by bombarding a californium target with calcium the required berkelium is a by product in californium production and obtaining the required amount of berkelium was an even more difficult task than obtaining that of californium as well as costly it would cost around million dollars and the parties agreed to wait for a commercial order of californium production from which berkelium could be extracted the jinr team sought to use berkelium because calcium the isotope of calcium used in the beam has protons and neutrons making a neutron proton ratio of and it is the lightest stable or near stable nucleus with such a large neutron excess the second lightest such nucleus palladium protons neutrons neutron proton ratio of is much heavier thanks to the neutron excess the resulting nuclei were expected to be heavier and closer to the sought after island of stability of the aimed for protons calcium has and thus they needed to use berkelium which has protons in its nucleus in february the leader of the jinr team yuri oganessian presented a colloquium at ornl also in attendance were representatives of lawrence livermore national laboratory who had previously worked with jinr on the discovery of elements and and joseph hamilton of vanderbilt university a collaborator of oganessian hamilton checked if the ornl high flux reactor produced californium for a commercial order the required berkelium could be obtained as a by product he learned that it did not and there was no expectation for such an order in the immediate future hamilton kept monitoring the situation making the checks once in a while later oganessian referred to hamilton as the father of for doing this work discovery ornl resumed californium production in spring hamilton noted the restart during the summer and made a deal on subsequent extraction of berkelium the price was about during a september symposium at vanderbilt university in nashville tennessee celebrating his th year on the physics faculty he introduced oganessian to james roberto then the deputy director for science and technology at ornl they established a collaboration among jinr ornl and vanderbilt the team at the lawrence livermore national laboratory llnl in livermore california u s was soon invited to join in november the u s department of energy which had oversight over the reactor in oak ridge allowed the scientific use of the extracted berkelium the production lasted days and ended in late december resulting in milligrams of berkelium enough to perform the experiment in january the berkelium was removed from ornl s high flux isotope reactor it was subsequently cooled for days and then processed at ornl s radiochemical engineering and development center to separate and purify the berkelium material which took another days its half life is only days after that time half the berkelium produced would have decayed because of this the berkelium target had to be quickly transported to russia for the experiment to be viable it had to be completed within six months of its departure from the united states the target was packed into five lead containers to be flown from new york to moscow russian customs officials twice refused to let the target enter the country because of missing or incomplete paperwork over the span of a few days the target traveled over the atlantic ocean five times on its arrival in russia in june the berkelium was immediately transferred to research institute of atomic reactors riar in dimitrovgrad ulyanovsk oblast where it was deposited as a nanometer thin layer on a titanium film in july it was transported to dubna where it was installed in the particle accelerator at the jinr the calcium beam was generated by chemically extracting the small quantities of calcium present in naturally occurring calcium enriching it times this work was done in the closed town of lesnoy sverdlovsk oblast russia the experiment began in late july in january scientists at the flerov laboratory of nuclear reactions announced internally that they had detected the decay of a new element with atomic number via two decay chains one of an odd odd isotope undergoing alpha decays before spontaneous fission and one of an odd even isotope undergoing alpha decays before fission the obtained data from the experiment was sent to the llnl for further analysis on april an official report was released in the journal physical review letters identifying the isotopes as and which were shown to have half lives on the order of tens or hundreds of milliseconds the work was signed by all parties involved in the experiment to some extent jinr ornl llnl riar vanderbilt the university of tennessee knoxville tennessee u s and the university of nevada las vegas nevada u s which provided data analysis support the isotopes were formed as follows bk ca n event bk ca n events confirmation all daughter isotopes decay products of element were previously unknown therefore their properties could not be used to confirm the claim of discovery in when one of the decay products was synthesized directly its properties matched those measured in the claimed indirect synthesis from the decay of element the discoverers did not submit a claim for their findings in when the joint working party was reviewing claims of discoveries of new elements the dubna team repeated the experiment in creating seven atoms of element and confirming their earlier synthesis of element produced after some time when a significant quantity of the berkelium target had beta decayed to californium the results of the experiment matched the previous outcome the scientists then filed an application to register the element in may a joint german american collaboration of scientists from the ornl and the gsi helmholtz center for heavy ion research in darmstadt hessen germany claimed to have confirmed discovery of the element the team repeated the dubna experiment using the darmstadt accelerator creating two atoms of element in december the jwp officially recognized the discovery of on account of the confirmation of the properties of its daughter and thus the listed discoverers jinr llnl and ornl were given the right to suggest an official name for the element vanderbilt was left off the initial list of discoverers in an error that was later corrected in may lund university lund scania sweden and gsi cast some doubt on the syntheses of elements and the decay chains assigned to the isotope instrumental in the confirmation of the syntheses of elements and were found based on a new statistical method to be too different to belong to the same nuclide with a reasonably high probability the reported decay chains approved as such by the jwp were found to require splitting into individual data sets assigned to different isotopes of element it was also found that the claimed link between the decay chains reported as from and probably did not exist on the other hand the chains from the non approved isotope were found to be congruent the multiplicity of states found when nuclides that are not even even undergo alpha decay is not unexpected and contributes to the lack of clarity in the cross reactions this study criticized the jwp report for overlooking subtleties associated with this issue and considered it problematic that the only argument for the acceptance of the discoveries of elements and was a link they considered to be doubtful on june two members of the dubna team published a journal article answering these criticisms analysing their data on the nuclides and with widely accepted statistical methods noted that the studies indicating non congruence produced problematic results when applied to radioactive decay they excluded from the confidence interval both average and extreme decay times and the decay chains that would be excluded from the confidence interval they chose were more probable to be observed than those that would be included the reanalysis concluded that the observed decay chains of and were consistent with the assumption that only one nuclide was present at each step of the chain although it would be desirable to be able to directly measure the mass number of the originating nucleus of each chain as well as the excitation function of the am ca reaction naming using mendeleev s nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements element should be known as eka astatine using the recommendations by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac the element was temporarily called ununseptium symbol uus until its discovery was confirmed and a permanent name chosen the temporary name was formed from latin roots one one and seven a reference to the element s atomic number many scientists in the field called it element with the symbol e or according to guidelines of iupac valid at the moment of the discovery approval the permanent names of new elements should have ended in ium this included element even if the element was a halogen which traditionally have names ending in ine however the new recommendations published in recommended using the ine ending for all new group elements after the original synthesis in dawn shaughnessy of llnl and oganessian declared that naming was a sensitive question and it was avoided as far as possible however hamilton declared that year i was crucial in getting the group together and in getting the bk target essential for the discovery as a result of that i m going to get to name the element i can t tell you the name but it will bring distinction to the region hamilton teaches at vanderbilt university in nashville tennessee u s in a interview oganessian after telling the story of the experiment said and the americans named this a tour de force they had demonstrated they could do this with no margin for error well soon they will name the th element in march the discovery team agreed on a conference call involving representatives from the parties involved on the name tennessine for element in june iupac published a declaration stating the discoverers had submitted their suggestions for naming the new elements and to the iupac the suggestion for the element was tennessine with a symbol of ts after the region of tennessee the suggested names were recommended for acceptance by the iupac inorganic chemistry division formal acceptance was set to occur after a five month term following publishing of the declaration expires in november the names including tennessine were formally accepted concerns that the proposed symbol ts may clash with a notation for the tosyl group used in organic chemistry were rejected following existing symbols bearing such dual meanings ac actinium and acetyl and pr praseodymium and propyl the naming ceremony for moscovium tennessine and oganesson was held on march at the russian academy of sciences in moscow a separate ceremony for tennessine alone had been held at ornl in january predicted properties other than nuclear properties no properties of tennessine or its compounds have been measured this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that it decays very quickly properties of tennessine remain unknown and only predictions are available nuclear stability and isotopes the stability of nuclei quickly decreases with the increase in atomic number after curium element whose half life is four orders of magnitude longer than that of any subsequent element all isotopes with an atomic number above undergo radioactive decay with half lives of less than hours no elements with atomic numbers above after lead have stable isotopes this is because of the ever increasing coulomb repulsion of protons so that the strong nuclear force cannot hold the nucleus together against spontaneous fission for long calculations suggest that in the absence of other stabilizing factors elements with more than protons should not exist however researchers in the s suggested that the closed nuclear shells around protons and neutrons should counteract this instability creating an island of stability where nuclides could have half lives reaching thousands or millions of years while scientists have still not reached the island the mere existence of the superheavy elements including tennessine confirms that this stabilizing effect is real and in general the known superheavy nuclides become exponentially longer lived as they approach the predicted location of the island tennessine is the second heaviest element created so far and all its known isotopes have half lives of less than one second nevertheless this is longer than the values predicted prior to their discovery the predicted lifetimes for ts and ts used in the discovery paper were ms and ms respectively while the observed lifetimes were ms and ms respectively the dubna team believes that the synthesis of the element is direct experimental proof of the existence of the island of stability it has been calculated that the isotope ts would have a half life of about milliseconds and it may be possible to produce this isotope via the same berkelium calcium reaction used in the discoveries of the known isotopes ts and ts the chance of this reaction producing ts is estimated to be at most one seventh the chance of producing ts calculations using a quantum tunneling model predict the existence of several isotopes of tennessine up to ts the most stable of these is expected to be ts with an alpha decay half life of milliseconds a liquid drop model study on the element s isotopes shows similar results it suggests a general trend of increasing stability for isotopes heavier than ts with partial half lives exceeding the age of the universe for the heaviest isotopes like ts when beta decay is not considered lighter isotopes of tennessine may be produced in the am ti reaction which was considered as a contingency plan by the dubna team in if bk proved unavailable and was considered again for study in to investigate the properties of nuclear reactions with a titanium beam which becomes necessary to synthesize elements beyond oganesson atomic and physical tennessine is expected to be a member of group in the periodic table below the five halogens fluorine chlorine bromine iodine and astatine each of which has seven valence electrons with a configuration of ns np for tennessine being in the seventh period row of the periodic table continuing the trend would predict a valence electron configuration of s p and it would therefore be expected to behave similarly to the halogens in many respects that relate to this electronic state however going down group the metallicity of the elements increases for example iodine already exhibits a metallic luster in the solid state and astatine is expected to be a metal as such an extrapolation based on periodic trends would predict tennessine to be a rather volatile metal calculations have confirmed the accuracy of this simple extrapolation although experimental verification of this is currently impossible as the half lives of the known tennessine isotopes are too short significant differences between tennessine and the previous halogens are likely to arise largely due to spin orbit interaction the mutual interaction between the motion and spin of electrons the spin orbit interaction is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move faster at velocities comparable to the speed of light than those in lighter atoms in tennessine atoms this lowers the s and the p electron energy levels stabilizing the corresponding electrons although two of the p electron energy levels are more stabilized than the other four the stabilization of the s electrons is called the inert pair effect the effect that separates the p subshell into the more stabilized and the less stabilized parts is called subshell splitting computational chemists understand the split as a change of the second azimuthal quantum number l from to and for the more stabilized and less stabilized parts of the p subshell respectively for many theoretical purposes the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the p subshell split as s p p differences for other electron levels also exist for example the d electron levels also split in two with four being d and six being d are both raised so they are close in energy to the s ones although no d electron chemistry has been predicted for tennessine the difference between the p and p levels is abnormally high ev astatine s p subshell split is only ev and its p chemistry has already been called limited these effects cause tennessine s chemistry to differ from those of its upper neighbors see below tennessine s first ionization energy the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom is predicted to be ev lower than those of the halogens again following the trend like its neighbors in the periodic table tennessine is expected to have the lowest electron affinity energy released when an electron is added to the atom in its group or ev the electron of the hypothetical hydrogen like tennessine atom oxidized so it has only one electron ts is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is times that of a non moving electron a feature attributable to relativistic effects for comparison the figure for hydrogen like astatine is and the figure for hydrogen like iodine is simple extrapolations of relativity laws indicate a contraction of atomic radius advanced calculations show that the radius of an tennessine atom that has formed one covalent bond would be pm while that of astatine would be pm with the seven outermost electrons removed tennessine is finally smaller pm for tennessine and pm for astatine the melting and boiling points of tennessine are not known earlier papers predicted about c and c respectively or c and c respectively these values exceed those of astatine and the lighter halogens following periodic trends a later paper predicts the boiling point of tennessine to be c that of astatine is estimated as c c or c although experimental values of c and c have been reported the density of tennessine is expected to be between and g cm continuing the trend of increasing density among the halogens that of astatine is estimated to be between and g cm chemical the known isotopes of tennessine ts and ts are too short lived to allow for chemical experimentation at present nevertheless many chemical properties of tennessine have been calculated unlike the lighter group elements tennessine may not exhibit the chemical behavior common to the halogens for example fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine routinely accept an electron to achieve the more stable electronic configuration of a noble gas obtaining eight electrons octet in their valence shells instead of seven this ability weakens as atomic weight increases going down the group tennessine would be the least willing group element to accept an electron of the oxidation states it is predicted to form is expected to be the least common the standard reduction potential of the ts ts couple is predicted to be v this value is negative unlike for all the lighter halogens there is another opportunity for tennessine to complete its octet by forming a covalent bond like the halogens when two tennessine atoms meet they are expected to form a ts ts bond to give a diatomic molecule such molecules are commonly bound via single sigma bonds between the atoms these are different from pi bonds which are divided into two parts each shifted in a direction perpendicular to the line between the atoms and opposite one another rather than being located directly between the atoms they bind sigma bonding has been calculated to show a great antibonding character in the at molecule and is not as favorable energetically tennessine is predicted to continue the trend a strong pi character should be seen in the bonding of ts the molecule tennessine chloride tscl is predicted to go further being bonded with a single pi bond aside from the unstable state three more oxidation states are predicted and the state should be especially stable because of the destabilization of the three outermost p electrons forming a stable half filled subshell configuration astatine shows similar effects the state should be important again due to the destabilized p electrons the state is predicted to be uncommon because the p electrons are oppositely stabilized the state has not been shown even computationally to be achievable because the s electrons are greatly stabilized it has been hypothesized that tennessine effectively has only five valence electrons the simplest possible tennessine compound would be the monohydride tsh the bonding is expected to be provided by a p electron of tennessine and the s electron of hydrogen the non bonding nature of the p spinor is because tennessine is expected not to form purely sigma or pi bonds therefore the destabilized thus expanded p spinor is responsible for bonding this effect lengthens the tsh molecule by picometers compared with the overall length of pm since the tennessine p electron bonds are two thirds sigma the bond is only two thirds as strong as it would be if tennessine featured no spin orbit interactions the molecule thus follows the trend for halogen hydrides showing an increase in bond length and a decrease in dissociation energy compared to ath the molecules tlts and nhts may be viewed analogously taking into account an opposite effect shown by the fact that the element s p electrons are stabilized these two characteristics result in a relatively small dipole moment product of difference between electric charges of atoms and displacement of the atoms for tlts only d the positive value implying that the negative charge is on the tennessine atom for nhts the strength of the effects are predicted to cause a transfer of the electron from the tennessine atom to the nihonium atom with the dipole moment value being d the spin orbit interaction increases the dissociation energy of the tsf molecule because it lowers the electronegativity of tennessine causing the bond with the extremely electronegative fluorine atom to have a more ionic character tennessine monofluoride should feature the strongest bonding of all group monofluorides vsepr theory predicts a bent t shaped molecular geometry for the group trifluorides all known halogen trifluorides have this molecular geometry and have a structure of ax e a central atom denoted a surrounded by three ligands x and two unshared electron pairs e if relativistic effects are ignored tsf should follow its lighter congeners in having a bent t shaped molecular geometry more sophisticated predictions show that this molecular geometry would not be energetically favored for tsf predicting instead a trigonal planar molecular geometry ax e this shows that vsepr theory may not be consistent for the superheavy elements the tsf molecule is predicted to be significantly stabilized by spin orbit interactions a possible rationale may be the large difference in electronegativity between tennessine and fluorine giving the bond a partially ionic character ,117
Oganesson,Og,oganesson is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol og and atomic number it was first synthesized in at the joint institute for nuclear research jinr in dubna near moscow russia by a joint team of russian and american scientists in december it was recognized as one of four new elements by the joint working party of the international scientific bodies iupac and iupap it was formally named on november the name honors the nuclear physicist yuri oganessian who played a leading role in the discovery of the heaviest elements in the periodic table it is one of only two elements named after a person who was alive at the time of naming the other being seaborgium and the only element whose eponym is alive today oganesson has the highest atomic number and highest atomic mass of all known elements the radioactive oganesson atom is very unstable and since only five possibly six atoms of the isotope oganesson have been detected although this allowed very little experimental characterization of its properties and possible compounds theoretical calculations have resulted in many predictions including some surprising ones for example although oganesson is a member of group the noble gases the first synthetic element to be so it may be significantly reactive unlike all the other elements of that group it was formerly thought to be a gas under normal conditions but is now predicted to be a solid due to relativistic effects on the periodic table of the elements it is a p block element and the last one of period introduction the heaviest atomic

the physicists analyze this data and seek to conclude that it was indeed caused by a new element and could not have been caused by a different nuclide than the one claimed often provided data is insufficient for a conclusion that a new element was definitely created and there is no other explanation for the observed effects errors in interpreting data have been made history early speculation the possibility of a seventh noble gas after helium neon argon krypton xenon and radon was considered almost as soon as the noble gas group was discovered danish chemist hans peter j rgen julius thomsen predicted in april the year after the discovery of argon that there was a whole series of chemically inert gases similar to argon that would bridge the halogen and alkali metal groups he expected that the seventh of this series would end a element period which contained thorium and uranium and have an atomic weight of close to the now known for the first and only confirmed isotope of oganesson danish physicist niels bohr noted in that this seventh noble gas should have atomic number and predicted its electronic structure as matching modern predictions following this german chemist aristid von grosse wrote an article in predicting the likely properties of element it was years from thomsen s prediction before oganesson was successfully synthesized although its chemical properties have not been investigated to determine if it behaves as the heavier congener of radon in a article american chemist kenneth pitzer suggested that element should be a gas or volatile liquid due to relativistic effects unconfirmed discovery claims in late polish physicist robert smola czuk published calculations on the fusion of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of superheavy atoms including oganesson his calculations suggested that it might be possible to make element by fusing lead with krypton under carefully controlled conditions and that the fusion probability cross section of that reaction would be close to the lead chromium reaction that had produced element seaborgium this contradicted predictions that the cross sections for reactions with lead or bismuth targets would go down exponentially as the atomic number of the resulting elements increased in researchers at lawrence berkeley national laboratory made use of these predictions and announced the discovery of elements and in a paper published in physical review letters and very soon after the results were reported in science the researchers reported that they had performed the reaction pb kr og n in they published a retraction after researchers at other laboratories were unable to duplicate the results and the berkeley lab could not duplicate them either in june the director of the lab announced that the original claim of the discovery of these two elements had been based on data fabricated by principal author victor ninov newer experimental results and theoretical predictions have confirmed the exponential decrease in cross sections with lead and bismuth targets as the atomic number of the resulting nuclide increases discovery reports the first genuine decay of atoms of oganesson was observed in at the joint institute for nuclear research jinr in dubna russia by a joint team of russian and american scientists headed by yuri oganessian a russian nuclear physicist of armenian ethnicity the team included american scientists of the lawrence livermore national laboratory california the discovery was not announced immediately because the decay energy of og matched that of mpo a common impurity produced in fusion reactions aimed at producing superheavy elements and thus announcement was delayed until after a confirmatory experiment aimed at producing more oganesson atoms the experiment used a different beam energy mev instead of mev and target thickness mg cm instead of mg cm on october the researchers announced that they had indirectly detected a total of three possibly four nuclei of oganesson one or two in and two more in produced via collisions of californium atoms and calcium ions cf ca og n in iupac evaluated the results of the dubna livermore collaboration and concluded the three events reported for the z isotope have very good internal redundancy but with no anchor to known nuclei do not satisfy the criteria for discovery because of the very small fusion reaction probability the fusion cross section is pb or m the experiment took four months and involved a beam dose of calcium ions that had to be shot at the californium target to produce the first recorded event believed to be the synthesis of oganesson nevertheless researchers were highly confident that the results were not a false positive since the chance that the detections were random events was estimated to be less than one part in in the experiments the alpha decay of three atoms of oganesson was observed a fourth decay by direct spontaneous fission was also proposed a half life of ms was calculated og decays into lv by alpha decay since there were only three nuclei the half life derived from observed lifetimes has a large uncertainty ms og lv hethe identification of the og nuclei was verified by separately creating the putative daughter nucleus lv directly by means of a bombardment of cm with ca ions cm ca lv n and checking that the lv decay matched the decay chain of the og nuclei the daughter nucleus lv is very unstable decaying with a lifetime of milliseconds into fl which may experience either spontaneous fission or alpha decay into cn which will undergo spontaneous fission confirmation in december the joint working party of international scientific bodies international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac and international union of pure and applied physics iupap recognized the element s discovery and assigned the priority of the discovery to the dubna livermore collaboration this was on account of two and confirmations of the properties of the granddaughter of og fl at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory as well as the observation of another consistent decay chain of og by the dubna group in the goal of that experiment had been the synthesis of ts via the reaction bk ca n but the short half life of bk resulted in a significant quantity of the target having decayed to cf resulting in the synthesis of oganesson instead of tennessine from october to april the dubna team performed a similar experiment with ca projectiles aimed at a mixed isotope californium target containing cf cf and cf with the aim of producing the heavier oganesson isotopes og and og two beam energies at mev and mev were used only one atom was seen at the lower beam energy whose decay chain fitted the previously known one of og terminating with spontaneous fission of fl and none were seen at the higher beam energy the experiment was then halted as the glue from the sector frames covered the target and blocked evaporation residues from escaping to the detectors the production of og and its daughter lv as well as the even heavier isotope og is also possible using this reaction the isotopes og and og may also be produced in the fusion of cm with ti projectiles a search beginning in summer at riken for og in the n channel of this reaction was unsuccessful though the study is planned to resume a detailed analysis and cross section limit were not provided these heavier and likely more stable isotopes may be useful in probing the chemistry of oganesson naming using mendeleev s nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements oganesson is sometimes known as eka radon until the s as eka emanation emanation being the old name for radon in iupac assigned the systematic placeholder name ununoctium to the undiscovered element with the corresponding symbol of uuo and recommended that it be used until after confirmed discovery of the element although widely used in the chemical community on all levels from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field who called it element with the symbol of e or even simply before the retraction in the researchers from berkeley had intended to name the element ghiorsium gh after albert ghiorso a leading member of the research team the russian discoverers reported their synthesis in according to iupac recommendations the discoverers of a new element have the right to suggest a name in the head of the russian institute stated the team were considering two names for the new element flyorium in honor of georgy flyorov the founder of the research laboratory in dubna and moskovium in recognition of the moscow oblast where dubna is located he also stated that although the element was discovered as an american collaboration who provided the californium target the element should rightly be named in honor of russia since the flyorov laboratory of nuclear reactions at jinr was the only facility in the world which could achieve this result these names were later suggested for element flerovium and element moscovium flerovium became the name of element the final name proposed for element was instead livermorium with moscovium later being proposed and accepted for element instead traditionally the names of all noble gases end in on with the exception of helium which was not known to be a noble gas when discovered the iupac guidelines valid at the moment of the discovery approval however required all new elements be named with the ending ium even if they turned out to be halogens traditionally ending in ine or noble gases traditionally ending in on while the provisional name ununoctium followed this convention a new iupac recommendation published in recommended using the on ending for new group elements regardless of whether they turn out to have the chemical properties of a noble gas the scientists involved in the discovery of element as well as those of and held a conference call on march to decide their names element was the last to be decided upon after oganessian was asked to leave the call the remaining scientists unanimously decided to have the element oganesson after him oganessian was a pioneer in superheavy element research for sixty years reaching back to the field s foundation his team and his proposed techniques had led directly to the synthesis of elements through mark stoyer a nuclear chemist at the llnl later recalled we had intended to propose that name from livermore and things kind of got proposed at the same time from multiple places i don t know if we can claim that we actually proposed the name but we had intended it in internal discussions iupac asked the jinr if they wanted the element to be spelled oganeson to match the russian spelling more closely oganessian and the jinr refused this offer citing the soviet era practice of transliterating names into the latin alphabet under the rules of the french language oganessian is such a transliteration and arguing that oganesson would be easier to link to the person in june iupac announced that the discoverers planned to give the element the name oganesson symbol og the name became official on november in oganessian commented on the naming for me it is an honour the discovery of element was by scientists at the joint institute for nuclear research in russia and at the lawrence livermore national laboratory in the us and it was my colleagues who proposed the name oganesson my children and grandchildren have been living in the us for decades but my daughter wrote to me to say that she did not sleep the night she heard because she was crying the naming ceremony for moscovium tennessine and oganesson was held on march at the russian academy of sciences in moscow in a interview when asked what it was like to see his name in the periodic table next to einstein mendeleev the curies and rutherford oganessian responded not like much you see not like much it is customary in science to name something new after its discoverer it s just that there are few elements and this happens rarely but look at how many equations and theorems in mathematics are named after somebody and in medicine alzheimer parkinson there s nothing special about it characteristics other than nuclear properties no properties of oganesson or its compounds have been measured this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that it decays very quickly thus only predictions are available nuclear stability and isotopes the stability of nuclei quickly decreases with the increase in atomic number after curium element whose half life is four orders of magnitude longer than that of any subsequent element all nuclides with an atomic number above undergo radioactive decay with half lives shorter than hours no elements with atomic numbers above after lead have stable isotopes this is because of the ever increasing coulomb repulsion of protons so that the strong nuclear force cannot hold the nucleus together against spontaneous fission for long calculations suggest that in the absence of other stabilizing factors elements with more than protons should not exist however researchers in the s suggested that the closed nuclear shells around protons and neutrons should counteract this instability creating an island of stability in which nuclides could have half lives reaching thousands or millions of years while scientists have still not reached the island the mere existence of the superheavy elements including oganesson confirms that this stabilizing effect is real and in general the known superheavy nuclides become exponentially longer lived as they approach the predicted location of the island oganesson is radioactive and has a half life that appears to be less than a millisecond nonetheless this is still longer than some predicted values calculations using a quantum tunneling model predict the existence of several heavier isotopes of oganesson with alpha decay half lives close to ms theoretical calculations done on the synthetic pathways for and the half life of other isotopes have shown that some could be slightly more stable than the synthesized isotope og most likely og og og og og og and og the last reaching the n shell closure of these og might provide the best chances for obtaining longer lived nuclei and thus might become the focus of future work with this element some isotopes with many more neutrons such as some located around og could also provide longer lived nuclei in a quantum tunneling model the alpha decay half life of og was predicted to be ms with the experimental q value published in calculation with theoretical q values from the macroscopic microscopic model of muntian hofman patyk sobiczewski gives somewhat lower but comparable results calculated atomic and physical properties oganesson is a member of group the zero valence elements the members of this group are usually inert to most common chemical reactions for example combustion because the outer valence shell is completely filled with eight electrons this produces a stable minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound it is thought that similarly oganesson has a closed outer valence shell in which its valence electrons are arranged in a s p configuration consequently some expect oganesson to have similar physical and chemical properties to other members of its group most closely resembling the noble gas above it in the periodic table radon following the periodic trend oganesson would be expected to be slightly more reactive than radon however theoretical calculations have shown that it could be significantly more reactive in addition to being far more reactive than radon oganesson may be even more reactive than the elements flerovium and copernicium which are heavier homologs of the more chemically active elements lead and mercury respectively the reason for the possible enhancement of the chemical activity of oganesson relative to radon is an energetic destabilization and a radial expansion of the last occupied p subshell more precisely considerable spin orbit interactions between the p electrons and the inert s electrons effectively lead to a second valence shell closing at flerovium and a significant decrease in stabilization of the closed shell of oganesson it has also been calculated that oganesson unlike the other noble gases binds an electron with release of energy or in other words it exhibits positive electron affinity due to the relativistically stabilized s energy level and the destabilized p level whereas copernicium and flerovium are predicted to have no electron affinity nevertheless quantum electrodynamic corrections have been shown to be quite significant in reducing this affinity by decreasing the binding in the anion og by thus confirming the importance of these corrections in superheavy elements calculations expect the electron affinity of oganesson to be ev by utilizing monte carlo simulations and molecular dynamics methods benchmarked against highly accurate relativistic coupled cluster calculations it could be shown that oganesson has a melting point of k and a boiling point of k the underlying reason for this behavior can be found in spin orbit relativistic effects non relativistic oganesson would melt around k thus oganesson would probably be a solid rather than a gas under standard conditions though still with a rather low melting point oganesson is expected to have an extremely broad polarizability almost double that of radon because of its tremendous polarizability oganesson is expected to have an anomalously low first ionization energy of about kj mol similar to that of cadmium and less than those of iridium platinum and gold this is significantly smaller than the values predicted for darmstadtium roentgenium and copernicium although it is greater than that predicted for flerovium its second ionization energy should be around kj mol even the shell structure in the nucleus and electron cloud of oganesson is strongly impacted by relativistic effects the valence and core electron subshells in oganesson are expected to be smeared out in a homogeneous fermi gas of electrons unlike those of the less relativistic radon and xenon although there is some incipient delocalisation in radon due to the very strong spin orbit splitting of the p orbital in oganesson a similar effect for nucleons particularly neutrons is incipient in the closed neutron shell nucleus og and is strongly in force at the hypothetical superheavy closed shell nucleus with protons and neutrons moreover spin orbit effects may cause bulk oganesson to be a semiconductor with a band gap of ev predicted all the lighter noble gases are insulators instead for example the band gap of bulk radon is expected to be ev predicted compounds the only confirmed isotope of oganesson og has much too short a half life to be chemically investigated experimentally therefore no compounds of oganesson have been synthesized yet nevertheless calculations on theoretical compounds have been performed since it is expected that if the ionization energy of the element is high enough it will be difficult to oxidize and therefore the most common oxidation state would be as for the noble gases nevertheless this appears not to be the case calculations on the diatomic molecule og showed a bonding interaction roughly equivalent to that calculated for hg and a dissociation energy of kj mol roughly times of that of rn most strikingly it was calculated to have a bond length shorter than in rn by which would be indicative of a significant bonding interaction on the other hand the compound ogh exhibits a dissociation energy in other words proton affinity of oganesson that is smaller than that of rnh the bonding between oganesson and hydrogen in ogh is predicted to be very weak and can be regarded as a pure van der waals interaction rather than a true chemical bond on the other hand with highly electronegative elements oganesson seems to form more stable compounds than for example copernicium or flerovium the stable oxidation states and have been predicted to exist in the fluorides ogf and ogf the state would be less stable due to the strong binding of the p subshell this is a result of the same spin orbit interactions that make oganesson unusually reactive for example it was shown that the reaction of oganesson with f to form the compound ogf would release an energy of kcal mol of which about kcal mol come from these interactions for comparison the spin orbit interaction for the similar molecule rnf is about kcal mol out of a formation energy of kcal mol the same interaction stabilizes the tetrahedral td configuration for ogf as distinct from the square planar d h one of xef which rnf is also expected to have this is because ogf is expected to have two inert electron pairs s and p as such ogf is expected to be unbound continuing an expected trend in the destabilisation of the oxidation state rnf is likewise expected to be much less stable than xef the og f bond will most probably be ionic rather than covalent rendering the oganesson fluorides non volatile ogf is predicted to be partially ionic due to oganesson s high electropositivity oganesson is predicted to be sufficiently electropositive to form an og cl bond with chlorine a compound of oganesson and tennessine ogts has been predicted to be potentially stable ,118
